ASV	Genesis	1	1	In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	2	And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	3	And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	4	And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	5	And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	6	And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	7	And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	8	And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	9	And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	10	And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	11	And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit-trees bearing fruit after their kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth: and it was so.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	12	And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after their kind: and God saw that it was good.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	13	And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	14	And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:	1
ASV	Genesis	1	15	and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	16	And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	17	And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth,	1
ASV	Genesis	1	18	and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	19	And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	20	And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	21	And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moveth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind: and God saw that it was good.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	22	And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	23	And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	24	And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind: and it was so.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	25	And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the ground after its kind: and God saw that it was good.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	26	And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth	1
ASV	Genesis	1	27	And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	28	And God blessed them: and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	29	And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food:	1
ASV	Genesis	1	30	and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for food: and it was so.	1
ASV	Genesis	1	31	And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.	1
ASV	Genesis	2	1	And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.	1
ASV	Genesis	2	2	And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.	1
ASV	Genesis	2	3	And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made.	1
ASV	Genesis	2	4	These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.	1
ASV	Genesis	2	5	And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth: and there was not a man to till the ground;	1
ASV	Genesis	2	6	but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.	1
ASV	Genesis	2	7	And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.	1
ASV	Genesis	2	8	And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.	1
ASV	Genesis	2	9	And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.	1
ASV	Genesis	2	10	And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads.	1
ASV	Genesis	2	11	The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;	1
ASV	Genesis	2	12	and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.	1
ASV	Genesis	2	13	And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush.	1
ASV	Genesis	2	14	And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.	1
ASV	Genesis	2	15	And Jehovah God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.	1
ASV	Genesis	2	16	And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:	1
ASV	Genesis	2	17	but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.	1
ASV	Genesis	2	18	And Jehovah God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.	1
ASV	Genesis	2	19	And out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them: and whatsoever the man called every living creature, that was the name thereof.	1
ASV	Genesis	2	20	And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but for man there was not found a help meet for him.	1
ASV	Genesis	2	21	And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof:	1
ASV	Genesis	2	22	and the rib, which Jehovah God had taken from the man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.	1
ASV	Genesis	2	23	And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.	1
ASV	Genesis	2	24	Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.	1
ASV	Genesis	2	25	And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.	1
ASV	Genesis	3	1	Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?	1
ASV	Genesis	3	2	And the woman said unto the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat:	1
ASV	Genesis	3	3	but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.	1
ASV	Genesis	3	4	And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:	1
ASV	Genesis	3	5	for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.	1
ASV	Genesis	3	6	And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat.	1
ASV	Genesis	3	7	And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons.	1
ASV	Genesis	3	8	And they heard the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God amongst the trees of the garden.	1
ASV	Genesis	3	9	And Jehovah God called unto the man, and said unto him, Where art thou?	1
ASV	Genesis	3	10	And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.	1
ASV	Genesis	3	11	And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?	1
ASV	Genesis	3	12	And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.	1
ASV	Genesis	3	13	And Jehovah God said unto the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.	1
ASV	Genesis	3	14	And Jehovah God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:	1
ASV	Genesis	3	15	and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.	1
ASV	Genesis	3	16	Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy conception; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.	1
ASV	Genesis	3	17	And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy lif	1
ASV	Genesis	3	18	thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;	1
ASV	Genesis	3	19	in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.	1
ASV	Genesis	3	20	And the man called his wifes name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.	1
ASV	Genesis	3	21	And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.	1
ASV	Genesis	3	22	And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever-	1
ASV	Genesis	3	23	therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.	1
ASV	Genesis	3	24	So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.	1
ASV	Genesis	4	1	And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man with the help of Jehovah.	1
ASV	Genesis	4	2	And again she bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.	1
ASV	Genesis	4	3	And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Jehovah.	1
ASV	Genesis	4	4	And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Jehovah had respect unto Abel and to his offering:	1
ASV	Genesis	4	5	but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.	1
ASV	Genesis	4	6	And Jehovah said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?	1
ASV	Genesis	4	7	If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door: and unto thee shall be its desire, but do thou rule over it.	1
ASV	Genesis	4	8	And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.	1
ASV	Genesis	4	9	And Jehovah said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brothers keeper?	1
ASV	Genesis	4	10	And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brothers blood crieth unto me from the ground.	1
ASV	Genesis	4	11	And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brothers blood from thy hand;	1
ASV	Genesis	4	12	when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	4	13	And Cain said unto Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.	1
ASV	Genesis	4	14	Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.	1
ASV	Genesis	4	15	And Jehovah said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.	1
ASV	Genesis	4	16	And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.	1
ASV	Genesis	4	17	And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.	1
ASV	Genesis	4	18	And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methushael; and Methushael begat Lamech.	1
ASV	Genesis	4	19	And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.	1
ASV	Genesis	4	20	And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle.	1
ASV	Genesis	4	21	And his brothers name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.	1
ASV	Genesis	4	22	And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.	1
ASV	Genesis	4	23	And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a young man for bruising me:	1
ASV	Genesis	4	24	If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.	1
ASV	Genesis	4	25	And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth. For, said she, God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.	1
ASV	Genesis	4	26	And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then began men to call upon the name of Jehovah.	1
ASV	Genesis	5	1	This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;	1
ASV	Genesis	5	2	male and female created he them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.	1
ASV	Genesis	5	3	And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:	1
ASV	Genesis	5	4	and the days of Adam after he begat Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters.	1
ASV	Genesis	5	5	And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.	1
ASV	Genesis	5	6	And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begat Enosh:	1
ASV	Genesis	5	7	and Seth lived after he begat Enosh eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:	1
ASV	Genesis	5	8	and all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.	1
ASV	Genesis	5	9	And Enosh lived ninety years, and begat Kenan.	1
ASV	Genesis	5	10	and Enosh lived after he begat Kenan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:	1
ASV	Genesis	5	11	and all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years: and he died.	1
ASV	Genesis	5	12	And Kenan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalalel:	1
ASV	Genesis	5	13	and Kenan lived after he begat Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:	1
ASV	Genesis	5	14	and all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.	1
ASV	Genesis	5	15	And Mahalalel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:	1
ASV	Genesis	5	16	And Mahalalel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:	1
ASV	Genesis	5	17	and all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.	1
ASV	Genesis	5	18	And Jared lived a hundred sixty and two years, and begat Enoch:	1
ASV	Genesis	5	19	and Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:	1
ASV	Genesis	5	20	And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.	1
ASV	Genesis	5	21	And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:	1
ASV	Genesis	5	22	and Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:	1
ASV	Genesis	5	23	and all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:	1
ASV	Genesis	5	24	and Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.	1
ASV	Genesis	5	25	And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech:	1
ASV	Genesis	5	26	and Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters.	1
ASV	Genesis	5	27	And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.	1
ASV	Genesis	5	28	And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:	1
ASV	Genesis	5	29	and he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, which cometh because of the ground which Jehovah hath cursed.	1
ASV	Genesis	5	30	And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:	1
ASV	Genesis	5	31	And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.	1
ASV	Genesis	5	32	And Noah was five hundred years old: And Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.	1
ASV	Genesis	6	1	And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born unto them,	1
ASV	Genesis	6	2	that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all that they chose.	1
ASV	Genesis	6	3	And Jehovah said, My spirit shall not strive with man for ever, for that he also is flesh: yet shall his days be a hundred and twenty years.	1
ASV	Genesis	6	4	The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them: the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.	1
ASV	Genesis	6	5	And Jehovah saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.	1
ASV	Genesis	6	6	And it repented Jehovah that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.	1
ASV	Genesis	6	7	And Jehovah said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the ground; both man, and beast, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; for it repenteth me that I have made them.	1
ASV	Genesis	6	8	But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.	1
ASV	Genesis	6	9	These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, and perfect in his generations: Noah walked with God.	1
ASV	Genesis	6	10	And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.	1
ASV	Genesis	6	11	And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.	1
ASV	Genesis	6	12	And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	6	13	And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	6	14	Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.	1
ASV	Genesis	6	15	And this is how thou shalt make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.	1
ASV	Genesis	6	16	A light shalt thou make to the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it upward; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.	1
ASV	Genesis	6	17	And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon this earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; everything that is in the earth shall die.	1
ASV	Genesis	6	18	But I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons wives with thee.	1
ASV	Genesis	6	19	And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.	1
ASV	Genesis	6	20	Of the birds after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.	1
ASV	Genesis	6	21	And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.	1
ASV	Genesis	6	22	Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.	1
ASV	Genesis	7	1	And Jehovah said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.	1
ASV	Genesis	7	2	Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and seven, the male and his female; and of the beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female:	1
ASV	Genesis	7	3	of the birds also of the heavens, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	7	4	For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the ground.	1
ASV	Genesis	7	5	And Noah did according unto all that Jehovah commanded him.	1
ASV	Genesis	7	6	And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	7	7	And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.	1
ASV	Genesis	7	8	Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creepeth upon the ground,	1
ASV	Genesis	7	9	there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, male and female, as God commanded Noah.	1
ASV	Genesis	7	10	And it came to pass after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	7	11	In the six hundredth year of Noahs life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.	1
ASV	Genesis	7	12	And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.	1
ASV	Genesis	7	13	In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noahs wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;	1
ASV	Genesis	7	14	they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort.	1
ASV	Genesis	7	15	And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life.	1
ASV	Genesis	7	16	And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him: and Jehovah shut him in.	1
ASV	Genesis	7	17	And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	7	18	And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.	1
ASV	Genesis	7	19	And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered.	1
ASV	Genesis	7	20	Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.	1
ASV	Genesis	7	21	And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both birds, and cattle, and beasts, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:	1
ASV	Genesis	7	22	all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died.	1
ASV	Genesis	7	23	And every living thing was destroyed that was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only was left, and they that were with him in the ark.	1
ASV	Genesis	7	24	And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.	1
ASV	Genesis	8	1	And God remembered Noah, and all the beasts, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged;	1
ASV	Genesis	8	2	the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;	1
ASV	Genesis	8	3	and the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased.	1
ASV	Genesis	8	4	And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.	1
ASV	Genesis	8	5	And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.	1
ASV	Genesis	8	6	And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:	1
ASV	Genesis	8	7	and he sent forth a raven, and it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	8	8	And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;	1
ASV	Genesis	8	9	but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him to the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her in unto him into the ark.	1
ASV	Genesis	8	10	And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;	1
ASV	Genesis	8	11	and the dove came in to him at eventide; and, lo, in her mouth an olive-leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	8	12	And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; and she returned not again unto him any more.	1
ASV	Genesis	8	13	And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dried.	1
ASV	Genesis	8	14	And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dry.	1
ASV	Genesis	8	15	And God spake unto Noah, saying,	1
ASV	Genesis	8	16	Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons wives with thee.	1
ASV	Genesis	8	17	Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both birds, and cattle, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	8	18	And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons wives with him:	1
ASV	Genesis	8	19	every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatsoever moveth upon the earth, after their families, went forth out of the ark.	1
ASV	Genesis	8	20	And Noah builded an altar unto Jehovah, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar.	1
ASV	Genesis	8	21	And Jehovah smelled the sweet savor; and Jehovah said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for mans sake, for that the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more everything living, as I have d	1
ASV	Genesis	8	22	While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	1	And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	2	And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird of the heavens; With all wherewith the ground teemeth, and all the fishes of the sea, into your hand are they delivered.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	3	Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; As the green herb have I given you all.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	4	But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	5	And surely your blood, the blood of your lives, will I require; At the hand of every beast will I require it. And at the hand of man, even at the hand of every mans brother, will I require the life of man.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	6	Whoso sheddeth mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed: For in the image of God made he man.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	7	And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; Bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	8	And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,	1
ASV	Genesis	9	9	And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;	1
ASV	Genesis	9	10	and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you. Of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	11	And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	12	And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:	1
ASV	Genesis	9	13	I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	14	And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud,	1
ASV	Genesis	9	15	and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	16	And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	17	And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	18	And the sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	19	These three were the sons of Noah: and of these was the whole earth overspread.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	20	And Noah began to be a husbandman, and planted a vineyard:	1
ASV	Genesis	9	21	and he drank of the wine, and was drunken. And he was uncovered within his tent.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	22	And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	23	And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father. And their faces were backward, and they saw not their fathers nakedness.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	24	And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done unto him.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	25	And he said, Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	26	And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	27	God enlarge Japheth, And let him dwell in the tents of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	28	And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.	1
ASV	Genesis	9	29	And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: And he died.	1
ASV	Genesis	10	1	Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, namely, of Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.	1
ASV	Genesis	10	2	The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.	1
ASV	Genesis	10	3	And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.	1
ASV	Genesis	10	4	And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.	1
ASV	Genesis	10	5	Of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.	1
ASV	Genesis	10	6	And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan.	1
ASV	Genesis	10	7	And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan.	1
ASV	Genesis	10	8	And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	10	9	He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah: wherefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before Jehovah.	1
ASV	Genesis	10	10	And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.	1
ASV	Genesis	10	11	Out of that land he went forth into Assyria, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-ir, and Calah,	1
ASV	Genesis	10	12	and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).	1
ASV	Genesis	10	13	And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,	1
ASV	Genesis	10	14	and Pathrusim, and Casluhim (whence went forth the Philistines), and Caphtorim.	1
ASV	Genesis	10	15	And Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth,	1
ASV	Genesis	10	16	and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,	1
ASV	Genesis	10	17	and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,	1
ASV	Genesis	10	18	and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad.	1
ASV	Genesis	10	19	And the border of the Canaanite was from Sidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha.	1
ASV	Genesis	10	20	These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.	1
ASV	Genesis	10	21	And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born.	1
ASV	Genesis	10	22	The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram.	1
ASV	Genesis	10	23	And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.	1
ASV	Genesis	10	24	And Arpachshad begat Shelah; and Shelah begat Eber.	1
ASV	Genesis	10	25	And unto Eber were born two sons: The name of the one was Peleg. For in his days was the earth divided. And his brothers name was Joktan.	1
ASV	Genesis	10	26	And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,	1
ASV	Genesis	10	27	and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,	1
ASV	Genesis	10	28	and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,	1
ASV	Genesis	10	29	and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.	1
ASV	Genesis	10	30	And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.	1
ASV	Genesis	10	31	These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.	1
ASV	Genesis	10	32	These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	1	And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	2	And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	3	And they said one to another, Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	4	And they said, Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	5	And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	6	And Jehovah said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	7	Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one anothers speech.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	8	So Jehovah scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off building the city.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	9	Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because Jehovah did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did Jehovah scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	10	These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begat Arpachshad two years after the flood.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	11	and Shem lived after he begat Arpachshad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	12	And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begat Shelah.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	13	and Arpachshad lived after he begat Shelah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	14	And Shelah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:	1
ASV	Genesis	11	15	and Shelah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	16	And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:	1
ASV	Genesis	11	17	and Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	18	And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:	1
ASV	Genesis	11	19	and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	20	And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:	1
ASV	Genesis	11	21	and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	22	And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:	1
ASV	Genesis	11	23	and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	24	And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:	1
ASV	Genesis	11	25	and Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	26	And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	27	Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran begat Lot.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	28	And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	29	And Abram and Nahor took them wives: The name of Abrams wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahors wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	30	And Sarai was barren; She had no child.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	31	And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his sons son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abrams wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.	1
ASV	Genesis	11	32	And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.	1
ASV	Genesis	12	1	Now Jehovah said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy fathers house, unto the land that I will show thee:	1
ASV	Genesis	12	2	and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make they name great; and be thou a blessing;	1
ASV	Genesis	12	3	and I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse: and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.	1
ASV	Genesis	12	4	So Abram went, as Jehovah had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.	1
ASV	Genesis	12	5	And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brothers son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.	1
ASV	Genesis	12	6	And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.	1
ASV	Genesis	12	7	And Jehovah appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto Jehovah, who appeared unto him.	1
ASV	Genesis	12	8	And he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto Jehovah, and called upon the name of Jehovah.	1
ASV	Genesis	12	9	And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South.	1
ASV	Genesis	12	10	And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was sore in the land.	1
ASV	Genesis	12	11	And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:	1
ASV	Genesis	12	12	and it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.	1
ASV	Genesis	12	13	Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister; that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee.	1
ASV	Genesis	12	14	And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.	1
ASV	Genesis	12	15	And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaohs house.	1
ASV	Genesis	12	16	And he dealt well with Abram for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels.	1
ASV	Genesis	12	17	And Jehovah plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abrams wife.	1
ASV	Genesis	12	18	And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?	1
ASV	Genesis	12	19	why saidst thou, She is my sister, so that I took her to be my wife? now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.	1
ASV	Genesis	12	20	And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him: and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had.	1
ASV	Genesis	13	1	And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South.	1
ASV	Genesis	13	2	And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.	1
ASV	Genesis	13	3	And he went on his journeys from the South even to Beth-el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Ai,	1
ASV	Genesis	13	4	unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of Jehovah.	1
ASV	Genesis	13	5	And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.	1
ASV	Genesis	13	6	And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.	1
ASV	Genesis	13	7	And there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abrams cattle and the herdsmen of Lots cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land.	1
ASV	Genesis	13	8	And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen; for we are brethren.	1
ASV	Genesis	13	9	Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me. If thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if thou take the right hand, then I will go to the left.	1
ASV	Genesis	13	10	And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the Plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, as thou goest unto Zoar.	1
ASV	Genesis	13	11	So Lot chose him all the Plain of the Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.	1
ASV	Genesis	13	12	Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the Plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.	1
ASV	Genesis	13	13	Now the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against Jehovah exceedingly.	1
ASV	Genesis	13	14	And Jehovah said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward and southward and eastward and westward:	1
ASV	Genesis	13	15	for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.	1
ASV	Genesis	13	16	And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: So that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then may thy seed also be numbered.	1
ASV	Genesis	13	17	Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for unto thee will I give it.	1
ASV	Genesis	13	18	And Abram moved his tent, and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built there an altar unto Jehovah.	1
ASV	Genesis	14	1	And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,	1
ASV	Genesis	14	2	that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar).	1
ASV	Genesis	14	3	All these joined together in the vale of Siddim (the same is the Salt Sea).	1
ASV	Genesis	14	4	Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.	1
ASV	Genesis	14	5	And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,	1
ASV	Genesis	14	6	and the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.	1
ASV	Genesis	14	7	And they returned, and came to En-mishpat (the same is Kadesh), and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon-tamar.	1
ASV	Genesis	14	8	And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar); and they set the battle in array against them in the vale of Siddim;	1
ASV	Genesis	14	9	against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five.	1
ASV	Genesis	14	10	Now the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and they that remained fled to the mountain.	1
ASV	Genesis	14	11	And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.	1
ASV	Genesis	14	12	And they took Lot, Abrams brothers son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.	1
ASV	Genesis	14	13	And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew: now he dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were confederate with Abram.	1
ASV	Genesis	14	14	And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan.	1
ASV	Genesis	14	15	And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.	1
ASV	Genesis	14	16	And he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.	1
ASV	Genesis	14	17	And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, at the vale of Shaveh (the same is the Kings Vale).	1
ASV	Genesis	14	18	And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was priest of God Most High.	1
ASV	Genesis	14	19	And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth:	1
ASV	Genesis	14	20	and blessed be God Most High, who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him a tenth of all.	1
ASV	Genesis	14	21	And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.	1
ASV	Genesis	14	22	And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand unto Jehovah, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,	1
ASV	Genesis	14	23	that I will not take a thread nor a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:	1
ASV	Genesis	14	24	save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men that went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their portion.	1
ASV	Genesis	15	1	After these things the word of Jehovah came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.	1
ASV	Genesis	15	2	And Abram said, O Lord Jehovah, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and he that shall be possessor of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?	1
ASV	Genesis	15	3	And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.	1
ASV	Genesis	15	4	And, behold, the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying, This man shall not be thine heir; But he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.	1
ASV	Genesis	15	5	And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and number the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.	1
ASV	Genesis	15	6	And he believed in Jehovah; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.	1
ASV	Genesis	15	7	And he said unto him, I am Jehovah that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.	1
ASV	Genesis	15	8	And he said, O Lord Jehovah, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?	1
ASV	Genesis	15	9	And he said unto him, Take me a heifer three years old, and a she-goat three years old, and a ram three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.	1
ASV	Genesis	15	10	And he took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each half over against the other: but the birds divided he not.	1
ASV	Genesis	15	11	And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.	1
ASV	Genesis	15	12	And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him.	1
ASV	Genesis	15	13	And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;	1
ASV	Genesis	15	14	and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.	1
ASV	Genesis	15	15	But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.	1
ASV	Genesis	15	16	And in the fourth generation they shall come hither again; for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.	1
ASV	Genesis	15	17	And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces.	1
ASV	Genesis	15	18	In that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:	1
ASV	Genesis	15	19	the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,	1
ASV	Genesis	15	20	and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim,	1
ASV	Genesis	15	21	and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.	1
ASV	Genesis	16	1	Now Sarai, Abrams wife, bare him no children: and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.	1
ASV	Genesis	16	2	And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, Jehovah hath restrained me from bearing; go in, I pray thee, unto my handmaid; it may be that I shall obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.	1
ASV	Genesis	16	3	And Sarai, Abrams wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife.	1
ASV	Genesis	16	4	And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.	1
ASV	Genesis	16	5	And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I gave my handmaid into they bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: Jehovah judge between me and thee.	1
ASV	Genesis	16	6	But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her that which is good in thine eyes. And Sarai dealt hardly with her, and she fled from her face.	1
ASV	Genesis	16	7	And the angel of Jehovah found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.	1
ASV	Genesis	16	8	And he said, Hagar, Sarais handmaid, whence camest thou? and whither goest thou? And she said, I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai.	1
ASV	Genesis	16	9	And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.	1
ASV	Genesis	16	10	And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, I will greatly multiply thy seed, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.	1
ASV	Genesis	16	11	And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son; and thou shalt call his name Ishmael, because Jehovah hath heard thy affliction.	1
ASV	Genesis	16	12	And he shall be as a wild ass among men; his hand shall be against every man, and every mans hand against him; and he shall dwell over against all his brethren.	1
ASV	Genesis	16	13	And she called the name of Jehovah that spake unto her, Thou art a God that seeth: for she said, Have I even here looked after him that seeth me?	1
ASV	Genesis	16	14	Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.	1
ASV	Genesis	16	15	And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bare, Ishmael.	1
ASV	Genesis	16	16	And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	1	And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, Jehovah appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be thou perfect.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	2	And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	3	And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,	1
ASV	Genesis	17	4	As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be the father of a multitude of nations.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	5	Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for the father of a multitude of nations have I made thee.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	6	And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	7	And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	8	And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	9	And God said unto Abraham, And as for thee, thou shalt keep my covenant, thou, and thy seed after thee throughout their generations.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	10	This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee: every male among you shall be circumcised.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	11	And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt me and you.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	12	And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any foreigner that is not of thy seed.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	13	He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	14	And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	15	And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	16	And I will bless her, and moreover I will give thee a son of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peoples shall be of her.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	17	Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?	1
ASV	Genesis	17	18	And Abraham said unto God, Oh that Ishmael might live before thee!	1
ASV	Genesis	17	19	And God said, Nay, but Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	20	And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	21	But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	22	And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	23	And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abrahams house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	24	And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	25	And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	26	In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.	1
ASV	Genesis	17	27	And all the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money of a foreigner, were circumcised with him.	1
ASV	Genesis	18	1	And Jehovah appeared unto him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;	1
ASV	Genesis	18	2	and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood over against him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,	1
ASV	Genesis	18	3	and said, My lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:	1
ASV	Genesis	18	4	let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:	1
ASV	Genesis	18	5	and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart; after that ye shall pass on: forasmuch as ye are come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.	1
ASV	Genesis	18	6	And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.	1
ASV	Genesis	18	7	And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto the servant; and he hasted to dress it.	1
ASV	Genesis	18	8	And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.	1
ASV	Genesis	18	9	And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.	1
ASV	Genesis	18	10	And he said, I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.	1
ASV	Genesis	18	11	Now Abraham and Sarah were old, and well stricken in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.	1
ASV	Genesis	18	12	And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?	1
ASV	Genesis	18	13	And Jehovah said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, who am old?	1
ASV	Genesis	18	14	Is anything too hard for Jehovah? At the set time I will return unto thee, when the season cometh round, and Sarah shall have a son.	1
ASV	Genesis	18	15	Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.	1
ASV	Genesis	18	16	And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.	1
ASV	Genesis	18	17	And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do;	1
ASV	Genesis	18	18	seeing that Abraham had surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?	1
ASV	Genesis	18	19	For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.	1
ASV	Genesis	18	20	And Jehovah said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;	1
ASV	Genesis	18	21	I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.	1
ASV	Genesis	18	22	And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before Jehovah.	1
ASV	Genesis	18	23	And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked?	1
ASV	Genesis	18	24	Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?	1
ASV	Genesis	18	25	That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?	1
ASV	Genesis	18	26	And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake.	1
ASV	Genesis	18	27	And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and ashes:	1
ASV	Genesis	18	28	peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five.	1
ASV	Genesis	18	29	And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the fortys sake.	1
ASV	Genesis	18	30	And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.	1
ASV	Genesis	18	31	And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the twentys sake.	1
ASV	Genesis	18	32	And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the tens sake.	1
ASV	Genesis	18	33	And Jehovah went his way, as soon as he had left off communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	1	And the two angels came to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth;	1
ASV	Genesis	19	2	and he said, Behold now, my lords, turn aside, I pray you, into your servants house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your way. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	3	And he urged them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	4	But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both young and old, all the people from every quarter;	1
ASV	Genesis	19	5	and they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men that came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	6	And Lot went out unto them to the door, and shut the door after him.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	7	And he said, I pray you, my brethren, do not so wickedly.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	8	Behold now, I have two daughters that have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing, forasmuch as they are come under the shadow of my roof.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	9	And they said, Stand back. And they said, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and drew near to break the door.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	10	But the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	11	And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	12	And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whomsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of the place:	1
ASV	Genesis	19	13	for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxed great before Jehovah: and Jehovah hath sent us to destroy it.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	14	And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons-in-law, who married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for Jehovah will destroy the city. But he seemed unto his sons-in-law as one that mocked.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	15	And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters that are here, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	16	But he lingered; and the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters, Jehovah being merciful unto him; and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	17	And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the Plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	18	And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my lord:	1
ASV	Genesis	19	19	behold now, thy servant hath found favor in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy lovingkindness, which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die:	1
ASV	Genesis	19	20	behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape thither (is it not a little one?), and my soul shall live.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	21	And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	22	Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	23	The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot came unto Zoar.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	24	Then Jehovah rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven;	1
ASV	Genesis	19	25	and he overthrew those cities, and all the Plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	26	But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	27	And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Jehovah:	1
ASV	Genesis	19	28	and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the Plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	29	And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	30	And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	31	And the first-born said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:	1
ASV	Genesis	19	32	come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	33	And they made their father drink wine that night: and the first-born went in, and lay with her father; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	34	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the first-born said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	35	And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	36	Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	37	And the first-born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.	1
ASV	Genesis	19	38	And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.	1
ASV	Genesis	20	1	And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur. And he sojourned in Gerar.	1
ASV	Genesis	20	2	And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister. And Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.	1
ASV	Genesis	20	3	But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, because of the woman whom thou hast taken. For she is a mans wife.	1
ASV	Genesis	20	4	Now Abimelech had not come near her. And he said, Lord, wilt thou slay even a righteous nation?	1
ASV	Genesis	20	5	Said he not himself unto me, She is my sister? And she, even she herself said, He is my brother. In the integrity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have I done this.	1
ASV	Genesis	20	6	And God said unto him in the dream, Yea, I know that in the integrity of thy heart thou has done this, and I also withheld thee from sinning against me. Therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.	1
ASV	Genesis	20	7	Now therefore restore the mans wife. For he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live. And if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.	1
ASV	Genesis	20	8	And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. And the men were sore afraid.	1
ASV	Genesis	20	9	Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? And wherein have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? Thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.	1
ASV	Genesis	20	10	And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?	1
ASV	Genesis	20	11	And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place. And they will slay me for my wifes sake.	1
ASV	Genesis	20	12	And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife:	1
ASV	Genesis	20	13	and it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my fathers house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me. At every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.	1
ASV	Genesis	20	14	And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and men-servants and women-servants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.	1
ASV	Genesis	20	15	And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee. Dwell where it pleaseth thee.	1
ASV	Genesis	20	16	And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee. And in respect of all thou art righted.	1
ASV	Genesis	20	17	And Abraham prayed unto God. And God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants. And they bare children.	1
ASV	Genesis	20	18	For Jehovah had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abrahams wife.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	1	And Jehovah visited Sarah as he had said, and Jehovah did unto Sarah as he had spoken.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	2	And Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	3	And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	4	And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	5	And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	6	And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh. Every one that heareth will laugh with me.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	7	And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should give children suck? For I have borne him a son in his old age.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	8	And the child grew, and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	9	And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne unto Abraham, mocking.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	10	Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this handmaid and her son. For the son of this handmaid shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	11	And the thing was very grievous in Abrahams sight on account of his son.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	12	And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy handmaid. In all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice. For in Isaac shall thy seed be called.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	13	And also of the son of the handmaid will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	14	And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and gave her the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	15	And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	16	And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot. For she said, Let me not look upon the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	17	And God heard the voice of the lad. And the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? Fear not. For God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	18	Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand. For I will make him a great nation.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	19	And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	20	And God was with the lad, and he grew. And he dwelt in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	21	And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran. And his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	22	And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	23	Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my sons son. But according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	24	And Abraham said, I will swear.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	25	And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which Abimelechs servants had violently taken away.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	26	And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing. Neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to-day.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	27	And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech. And they two made a covenant.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	28	And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	29	And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?	1
ASV	Genesis	21	30	And he said, These seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	31	Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba. Because there they sware both of them.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	32	So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. And Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	33	And Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of Jehovah, the Everlasting God.	1
ASV	Genesis	21	34	And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.	1
ASV	Genesis	22	1	And it came to pass after these things, that God did prove Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham. And he said, Here am I.	1
ASV	Genesis	22	2	And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah. And offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.	1
ASV	Genesis	22	3	And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. And he clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.	1
ASV	Genesis	22	4	On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.	1
ASV	Genesis	22	5	And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come again to you.	1
ASV	Genesis	22	6	And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. And they went both of them together.	1
ASV	Genesis	22	7	And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood. But where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?	1
ASV	Genesis	22	8	And Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son. So they went both of them together.	1
ASV	Genesis	22	9	And they came to the place which God had told him of. And Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.	1
ASV	Genesis	22	10	And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.	1
ASV	Genesis	22	11	And the angel of Jehovah called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here I am.	1
ASV	Genesis	22	12	And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him. For now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me.	1
ASV	Genesis	22	13	And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son.	1
ASV	Genesis	22	14	And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh. As it is said to this day, In the mount of Jehovah it shall be provided.	1
ASV	Genesis	22	15	And the angel of Jehovah called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven,	1
ASV	Genesis	22	16	and said, By myself have I sworn, saith Jehovah, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son,	1
ASV	Genesis	22	17	that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is upon the seashore. And thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies.	1
ASV	Genesis	22	18	And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. Because thou hast obeyed my voice.	1
ASV	Genesis	22	19	So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba. And Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.	1
ASV	Genesis	22	20	And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also hath borne children unto they brother Nahor.	1
ASV	Genesis	22	21	Uz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram.	1
ASV	Genesis	22	22	And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.	1
ASV	Genesis	22	23	And Bethuel begat Rebekah. These eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, Abrahams brother.	1
ASV	Genesis	22	24	And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bare Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah.	1
ASV	Genesis	23	1	And the life of Sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years. These were the years of the life of Sarah.	1
ASV	Genesis	23	2	And Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan. And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.	1
ASV	Genesis	23	3	And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spake unto the children of Heth, saying,	1
ASV	Genesis	23	4	I am a stranger and a sojourner with you. Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.	1
ASV	Genesis	23	5	And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,	1
ASV	Genesis	23	6	Hear us, my lord. Thou art a prince of God among us. In the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead. None of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.	1
ASV	Genesis	23	7	And Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.	1
ASV	Genesis	23	8	And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,	1
ASV	Genesis	23	9	that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in the midst of you for a possession of a burying-place.	1
ASV	Genesis	23	10	Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,	1
ASV	Genesis	23	11	Nay, my lord, hear me. The field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee. In the presence of the children of my people give I it thee. Bury thy dead.	1
ASV	Genesis	23	12	And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.	1
ASV	Genesis	23	13	And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt, I pray thee, hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.	1
ASV	Genesis	23	14	And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,	1
ASV	Genesis	23	15	My lord, hearken unto me. A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that betwixt me and thee? Bury therefore thy dead.	1
ASV	Genesis	23	16	And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron. And Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.	1
ASV	Genesis	23	17	So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the border thereof round about, were made sure	1
ASV	Genesis	23	18	unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.	1
ASV	Genesis	23	19	And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan.	1
ASV	Genesis	23	20	And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a burying-place by the children of Heth.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	1	And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age. And Jehovah had blessed Abraham in all things.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	2	And Abraham said unto his servant, the elder of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	3	And I will make thee swear by Jehovah, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that thou wilt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	4	But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	5	And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land. Must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?	1
ASV	Genesis	24	6	And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	7	Jehovah, the God of heaven, who took me from my fathers house, and from the land of my nativity, and who spake unto me, and who sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land. He will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for	1
ASV	Genesis	24	8	And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath. Only thou shalt not bring my son thither again.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	9	And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning this matter.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	10	And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed, having all goodly things of his masters in his hand. And he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	11	And he made the camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	12	And he said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, send me, I pray thee, good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master Abraham.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	13	Behold, I am standing by the fountain of water. And the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	14	And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink. And she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. Let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac. And the	1
ASV	Genesis	24	15	And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abrahams brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	16	And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her. And she went down to the fountain, and filled her pitcher, and came up.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	17	And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	18	And she said, Drink, my lord. And she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	19	And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	20	And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	21	And the man looked stedfastly on her, holding his peace, to know whether Jehovah had made his journey prosperous or not.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	22	And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,	1
ASV	Genesis	24	23	and said, Whose daughter art thou? Tell me, I pray thee. Is there room in thy fathers house for us to lodge in?	1
ASV	Genesis	24	24	And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bare unto Nahor.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	25	She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	26	And the man bowed his head, and worshipped Jehovah.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	27	And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who hath not forsaken his lovingkindness and his truth toward my master. As for me, Jehovah hath led me in the way to the house of my masters brethren.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	28	And the damsel ran, and told her mothers house according to these words.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	29	And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the fountain.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	30	And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets upon his sisters hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me. That he came unto the man. And, behold, he was standing by the camels at the founta	1
ASV	Genesis	24	31	And he said, Come in, thou blessed of Jehovah. Wherefore standest thou without? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	32	And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels. And he gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men that were with him.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	33	And there was set food before him to eat. But he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	34	And he said, I am Abrahams servant.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	35	And Jehovah hath blessed my master greatly. And he is become great. And he hath given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and men-servants and maid-servants, and camels and asses.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	36	And Sarah my masters wife bare a son to my master when she was old. And unto him hath he given all that he hath.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	37	And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	38	But thou shalt go unto my fathers house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	39	And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	40	And he said unto me, Jehovah, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way. And thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my fathers house.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	41	Then shalt thou be clear from my oath, when thou comest to my kindred. And if they give her not to thee, thou shalt be clear from my oath.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	42	And I came this day unto the fountain, and said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	43	Behold, I am standing by the fountain of water. And let it come to pass, that the maiden that cometh forth to draw, to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher to drink.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	44	And she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels. Let the same be the woman whom Jehovah hath appointed for my masters son.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	45	And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder. And she went down unto the fountain, and drew. And I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	46	And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. So I drank, and she made the camels drink also.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	47	And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahors son, whom Milcah bare unto him. And I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	48	And I bowed my head, and worshipped Jehovah, and blessed Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my masters brothers daughter for his son.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	49	And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. And if not, tell me. That I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	50	Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from Jehovah. We cannot speak unto thee bad or good.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	51	Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy masters sons wife, as Jehovah hath spoken.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	52	And it came to pass, that, when Abrahams servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth unto Jehovah.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	53	And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah. He gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	54	And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night. And they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	55	And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten. After that she shall go.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	56	And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing Jehovah hath prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	57	And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	58	And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	59	And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abrahams servant, and his men.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	60	And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let thy seed possess the gate of those that hate them.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	61	And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. And the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	62	And Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi. For he dwelt in the land of the South.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	63	And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	64	And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	65	And she said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master. And she took her veil, and covered herself.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	66	And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.	1
ASV	Genesis	24	67	And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarahs tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife. And he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after his mothers death.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	1	And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	2	And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	3	And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	4	And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	5	And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	6	But unto the sons of the concubines, that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts. And he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	7	And these are the days of the years of Abrahams life which he lived, a hundred threescore and fifteen years.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	8	And Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	9	And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	10	The field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth. There was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	11	And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son. And Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	12	Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abrahams son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarahs handmaid, bare unto Abraham.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	13	And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth, and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,	1
ASV	Genesis	25	14	and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,	1
ASV	Genesis	25	15	Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	16	These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments. Twelve princes according to their nations.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	17	And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty and seven years. And he gave up the ghost and died, and was gathered unto his people.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	18	And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria. He abode over against all his brethren.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	19	And these are the generations of Isaac, Abrahams son. Abraham begat Isaac.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	20	And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	21	And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because she was barren. And Jehovah was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	22	And the children struggled together within her. And she said, If it be so, wherefore do I live? And she went to inquire of Jehovah.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	23	And Jehovah said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, And two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels. And the one people shall be stronger than the other people. And the elder shall serve the younger.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	24	And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	25	And the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment. And they called his name Esau.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	26	And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esaus heel. And his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	27	And the boys grew. And Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of the field. And Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	28	Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison. And Rebekah loved Jacob.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	29	And Jacob boiled pottage. And Esau came in from the field, and he was faint.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	30	And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage. For I am faint. Therefore was his name called Edom.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	31	And Jacob said, Sell me first thy birthright.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	32	And Esau said, Behold, I am about to die. And what profit shall the birthright do to me?	1
ASV	Genesis	25	33	And Jacob said, Swear to me first. And he sware unto him. And he sold his birthright unto Jacob.	1
ASV	Genesis	25	34	And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils. And he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	1	And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines, unto Gerar.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	2	And Jehovah appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt. Dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	3	Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee. For unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	4	And I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these lands. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	5	Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	6	And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	7	And the men of the place asked him of his wife. And he said, She is my sister. For he feared to say, My wife. Lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah. Because she was fair to look upon.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	8	And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	9	And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife. And how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die because of her.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	10	And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? One of the people might easily have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	11	And Abimelech charged all the people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	12	And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year a hundredfold. And Jehovah blessed him.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	13	And the man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	14	And he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household. And the Philistines envied him.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	15	Now all the wells which his fathers servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	16	And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us. For thou art much mightier than we.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	17	And Isaac departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	18	And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father. For the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. And he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	19	And Isaacs servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	20	And the herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaacs herdsmen, saying, The water is ours. And he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	21	And they digged another well, and they strove for that also. And he called the name of it Sitnah.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	22	And he removed from thence, and digged another well. And for that they strove not. And he called the name of it Rehoboth. And he said, For now Jehovah hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	23	And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	24	And Jehovah appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father. Fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abrahams sake.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	25	And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of Jehovah, and pitched his tent there. And there Isaacs servants digged a well.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	26	Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his host.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	27	And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore are ye come unto me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?	1
ASV	Genesis	26	28	And they said, We saw plainly that Jehovah was with thee. And we said, Let there now be an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee,	1
ASV	Genesis	26	29	that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace. Thou art now the blessed of Jehovah.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	30	And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	31	And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another. And Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	32	And it came to pass the same day, that Isaacs servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	33	And he called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	34	And when Esau was forty years old he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.	1
ASV	Genesis	26	35	And they were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	1	And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said unto him, My son. And he said unto him, Here am I.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	2	And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	3	Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me venison.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	4	And make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat. That my soul may bless thee before I die.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	5	And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	6	And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,	1
ASV	Genesis	27	7	Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless thee before Jehovah before my death.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	8	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	9	Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats. And I will make them savory food for thy father, such as he loveth.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	10	And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, so that he may bless thee before his death.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	11	And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	12	My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver. And I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	13	And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son. Only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	14	And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother. And his mother made savory food, such as his father loved.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	15	And Rebekah took the goodly garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	16	And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	17	And she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	18	And he came unto his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here am I. Who art thou, my son?	1
ASV	Genesis	27	19	And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first-born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	20	And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because Jehovah thy God sent me good speed.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	21	And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	22	And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father. And he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacobs voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	23	And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esaus hands. So he blessed him.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	24	And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	25	And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my sons venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat. And he brought him wine, and he drank.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	26	And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	27	And he came near, and kissed him. And he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son Is as the smell of a field which Jehovah hath blessed.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	28	And God give thee of the dew of heaven, And of the fatness of the earth, And plenty of grain and new wine.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	29	Let peoples serve thee, And nations bow down to thee. Be lord over thy brethren, And let thy mothers sons bow down to thee. Cursed be every one that curseth thee, And blessed be every one that blesseth thee.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	30	And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	31	And he also made savory food, and brought it unto his father. And he said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his sons venison, that thy soul may bless me.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	32	And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy first-born, Esau.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	33	And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who then is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? Yea, and he shall be blessed.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	34	When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	35	And he said, Thy brother came with guile, and hath taken away thy blessing.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	36	And he said, Is not he rightly name Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two time. He took away my birthright. And, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?	1
ASV	Genesis	27	37	And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants. And with grain and new wine have I sustained him. And what then shall I do for thee, my son?	1
ASV	Genesis	27	38	And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	39	And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, of the fatness of the earth shall be thy dwelling, And of the dew of heaven from above.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	40	And by thy sword shalt thou live, and thou shalt serve thy brother. And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt break loose, That thou shalt shake his yoke from off thy neck.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	41	And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him. And Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then will I slay my brother Jacob.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	42	And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah. And she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	43	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. And arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	44	And tarry with him a few days, until thy brothers fury turn away.	1
ASV	Genesis	27	45	Until thy brothers anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him. Then I will send, and fetch thee from thence. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?	1
ASV	Genesis	27	46	And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?	1
ASV	Genesis	28	1	And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.	1
ASV	Genesis	28	2	Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mothers father. And take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mothers brother.	1
ASV	Genesis	28	3	And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a company of peoples.	1
ASV	Genesis	28	4	And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee. That thou mayest inherit the land of thy sojournings, which God gave unto Abraham.	1
ASV	Genesis	28	5	And Isaac sent away Jacob. And he went to Paddan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacobs and Esaus mother.	1
ASV	Genesis	28	6	Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram, to take him a wife from thence. And that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.	1
ASV	Genesis	28	7	And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan-aram.	1
ASV	Genesis	28	8	And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father.	1
ASV	Genesis	28	9	And Esau went unto Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abrahams son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.	1
ASV	Genesis	28	10	And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.	1
ASV	Genesis	28	11	And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set. And he took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.	1
ASV	Genesis	28	12	And he dreamed. And behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it.	1
ASV	Genesis	28	13	And, behold, Jehovah stood above it, and said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac. The land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.	1
ASV	Genesis	28	14	And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. And in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.	1
ASV	Genesis	28	15	And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee, whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land. For I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.	1
ASV	Genesis	28	16	And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely Jehovah is in this place. And I knew it not.	1
ASV	Genesis	28	17	And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.	1
ASV	Genesis	28	18	And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.	1
ASV	Genesis	28	19	And he called the name of that place Beth-el. But the name of the city was Luz at the first.	1
ASV	Genesis	28	20	And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,	1
ASV	Genesis	28	21	so that I come again to my fathers house in peace, and Jehovah will be my God,	1
ASV	Genesis	28	22	then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be Gods house. And of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	1	Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	2	And he looked, and behold, a well in the field, and, lo, three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out of that well they watered the flocks. And the stone upon the wells mouth was great.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	3	And thither were all the flocks gathered. And they rolled the stone from the wells mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the wells mouth in its place.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	4	And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence are ye? And they said, Of Haran are we.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	5	And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	6	And he said unto them, Is it well with him? And they said, It is well. And, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	7	And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together. Water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	8	And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the wells mouth. Then we water the sheep.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	9	While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her fathers sheep. For she kept them.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	10	And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mothers brother, and the sheep of Laban his mothers brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the wells mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mothers brother.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	11	And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	12	And Jacob told Rachel that he was her fathers brother, and that he was Rebekahs son. And she ran and told her father.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	13	And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sisters son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	14	And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	15	And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? Tell me, what shall thy wages be?	1
ASV	Genesis	29	16	And Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	17	And Leahs eyes were tender. But Rachel was beautiful and well favored.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	18	And Jacob loved Rachel. And he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	19	And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man. Abide with me.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	20	And Jacob served seven years for Rachel. And they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	21	And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	22	And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	23	And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him. And he went in unto her.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	24	And Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	25	And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah. And he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? Did not I serve with thee for Rachel? Wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?	1
ASV	Genesis	29	26	And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the first-born.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	27	Fulfil the week of this one, and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	28	And jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. And he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	29	And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	30	And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	31	And Jehovah saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb. But Rachel was barren.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	32	And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben. For she said, Because Jehovah hath looked upon my affliction. For now my husband will love me.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	33	And she conceived again, and bare a son: and said, Because Jehovah hath heard that I am hated, he hath therefore given me this son also. And she called his name Simeon.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	34	And she conceived again, and bare a son. And said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have borne him three sons. Therefore was his name called Levi.	1
ASV	Genesis	29	35	And she conceived again, and bare a son. And she said, This time will I praise Jehovah. Therefore she called his name Judah. And she left off bearing.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	1	And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and she said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	2	And Jacobs anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in Gods stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?	1
ASV	Genesis	30	3	And she said, Behold, my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; that she may bear upon my knees, and I also may obtain children by her.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	4	And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	5	And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	6	And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	7	And Bilhah Rachels handmaid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	8	And Rachel said, With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	9	When Leah saw that she had left off bearing, she took Zilpah her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob to wife.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	10	And Zilpah Leahs handmaid bare Jacob a son.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	11	And Leah said, Fortunate! and she called his name Gad.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	12	And Zilpah Leahs handmaid bare Jacob a second son.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	13	And Leah said, Happy am I! for the daughters will call me happy: and she called his name Asher.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	14	And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy sons mandrakes.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	15	And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my husband? and wouldest thou take away my sons mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy sons mandrakes.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	16	And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for I have surely hired thee with my sons mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	17	And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob a fifth son.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	18	And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	19	And Leah conceived again, and bare a sixth son to Jacob.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	20	And Leah said, God hath endowed me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	21	And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	22	And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	23	And she conceived, and bare a son: and said, God hath taken away my reproach:	1
ASV	Genesis	30	24	and she called his name Joseph, saying, Jehovah add to me another son.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	25	And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	26	Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service wherewith I have served thee.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	27	And Laban said unto him, If now I have found favor in thine eyes, tarry: for I have divined that Jehovah hath blessed me for thy sake.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	28	And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	29	And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle have fared with me.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	30	For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it hath increased unto a multitude; and Jehovah hath blessed thee whithersoever I turned: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?	1
ASV	Genesis	30	31	And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me aught: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed thy flock and keep it.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	32	I will pass through all thy flock to-day, removing from thence every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	33	So shall my righteousness answer for me hereafter, when thou shalt come concerning my hire that is before thee: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that if found with me, shall be counted stolen.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	34	And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	35	And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstreaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons;	1
ASV	Genesis	30	36	and he set three days journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Labans flocks.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	37	And Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane-tree. And peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	38	And he set the rods which he had peeled over against the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they conceived when they came to drink.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	39	And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	40	And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and put them not unto Labans flock.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	41	And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;	1
ASV	Genesis	30	42	but when the flock were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Labans, and the stronger Jacobs.	1
ASV	Genesis	30	43	And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maid-servants and men-servants, and camels and asses.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	1	And he heard the words of Labans sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our fathers; and of that which was our fathers hath he gotten all this glory.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	2	And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as beforetime.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	3	And Jehovah said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	4	And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,	1
ASV	Genesis	31	5	and said unto them, I see your fathers countenance, that it is not toward me as beforetime; but the God of my father hath been with me.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	6	And ye know that will all my power I have served your father.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	7	And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	8	If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the flock bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstreaked shall be thy wages; then bare all the flock ringstreaked.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	9	Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	10	And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceive, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	11	And the angel of God said unto me in the dream, Jacob: and I said, Here am I.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	12	And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the he-goats which leap upon the flock are ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	13	I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst a pillar, where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy nativity.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	14	And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our fathers house?	1
ASV	Genesis	31	15	Are we not accounted by him as foreigners? for he hath sold us, and hath also quite devoured our money.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	16	For all the riches which God hath taken away from our father, that is ours and our childrens: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	17	Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon the camels;	1
ASV	Genesis	31	18	and he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had gathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac his father unto the land of Canaan.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	19	Now Laban was gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her fathers.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	20	And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	21	So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	22	And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	23	And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days journey; and he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	24	And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said unto him, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	25	And Laban came up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain: and Laban with his brethren encamped in the mountain of Gilead.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	26	And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives of the sword?	1
ASV	Genesis	31	27	Wherefore didst thou flee secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with tabret and with harp;	1
ASV	Genesis	31	28	and didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and my daughters? now hast thou done foolishly.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	29	It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	30	And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy fathers house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?	1
ASV	Genesis	31	31	And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Lest thou shouldest take thy daughters from me by force.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	32	With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	33	And Laban went into Jacobs tent, and into Leahs tent, and into the tent of the two maid-servants; but he found them not. And he went out of Leahs tent, and entered into Rachels tent.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	34	Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and put them in the camels saddle, and sat upon them. And Laban felt about all the tent, but found them not.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	35	And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee; for the manner of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the teraphim.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	36	And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast hotly pursued after me?	1
ASV	Genesis	31	37	Whereas thou hast felt about all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us two.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	38	These twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flocks have I not eaten.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	39	That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	40	Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from mine eyes.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	41	These twenty years have I been in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	42	Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now hadst thou sent me away empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	43	And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children whom they h	1
ASV	Genesis	31	44	And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	45	And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	46	And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they did eat there by the heap.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	47	And Laban called it Jegar-saha-dutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	48	And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed:	1
ASV	Genesis	31	49	and Mizpah, for he said, Jehovah watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	50	If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou shalt take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	51	And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I have set betwixt me and thee.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	52	This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	53	The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the Fear of his father Isaac.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	54	And Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain.	1
ASV	Genesis	31	55	And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed and returned unto his place.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	1	And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	2	And Jacob said when he saw them, This is Gods host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	3	And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	4	And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now:	1
ASV	Genesis	32	5	and I have oxen, and asses, and flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	6	And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	7	Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;	1
ASV	Genesis	32	8	and he said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the company which is left shall escape.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	9	And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good:	1
ASV	Genesis	32	10	I am not worthy of the least of all the lovingkindnesses, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two companies.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	11	Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	12	And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	13	And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:	1
ASV	Genesis	32	14	two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,	1
ASV	Genesis	32	15	thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	16	And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	17	And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?	1
ASV	Genesis	32	18	then thou shalt say They are thy servant Jacobs; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, he also is behind us.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	19	And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him;	1
ASV	Genesis	32	20	and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	21	So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	22	And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	23	And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	24	And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	25	And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacobs thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	26	And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	27	And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	28	And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	29	And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	30	And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, said he, I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	31	And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped upon his thigh.	1
ASV	Genesis	32	32	Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacobs thigh in the sinew of the hip.	1
ASV	Genesis	33	1	And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.	1
ASV	Genesis	33	2	And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.	1
ASV	Genesis	33	3	And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.	1
ASV	Genesis	33	4	And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.	1
ASV	Genesis	33	5	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are these with thee? And he said, The children whom God hath graciously given thy servant.	1
ASV	Genesis	33	6	Then the handmaids came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.	1
ASV	Genesis	33	7	And Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.	1
ASV	Genesis	33	8	And he said, What meanest thou by all this company which I met? And he said, To find favor in the sight of my lord.	1
ASV	Genesis	33	9	And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; let that which thou hast be thine.	1
ASV	Genesis	33	10	And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found favor in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand; forasmuch as I have seen thy face, as one seeth the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.	1
ASV	Genesis	33	11	Take, I pray thee, my gift that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.	1
ASV	Genesis	33	12	And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.	1
ASV	Genesis	33	13	And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young: and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.	1
ASV	Genesis	33	14	Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.	1
ASV	Genesis	33	15	And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find favor in the sight of my lord.	1
ASV	Genesis	33	16	So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.	1
ASV	Genesis	33	17	And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.	1
ASV	Genesis	33	18	And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram; and encamped before the city.	1
ASV	Genesis	33	19	And he bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechems father, for a hundred pieces of money.	1
ASV	Genesis	33	20	And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-israel.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	1	And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	2	And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her; And he took her, and lay with her, and humbled her.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	3	And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	4	And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	5	Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; and his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they came.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	6	And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	7	And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacobs daughter; which thing ought not to be done.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	8	And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you, give her unto him to wife.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	9	And make ye marriages with us; give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	10	And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	11	And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find favor in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	12	Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	13	And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with guile, and spake, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,	1
ASV	Genesis	34	14	and said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	15	Only on this condition will we consent unto you: if ye will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised;	1
ASV	Genesis	34	16	then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	17	But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	18	And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamors son.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	19	And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacobs daughter: and he was honored above all the house of his father.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	20	And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,	1
ASV	Genesis	34	21	These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for, behold, the land is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	22	Only on this condition will the men consent unto us to dwell with us, to become one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	23	Shall not their cattle and their substance and all their beasts be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	24	And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	25	And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinahs brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city unawares, and slew all the males.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	26	And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechems house, and went forth.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	27	The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	28	They took their flocks and their herds and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field;	1
ASV	Genesis	34	29	and all their wealth, and all their little ones and their wives, took they captive and made a prey, even all that was in the house.	1
ASV	Genesis	34	30	And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and, I being few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and smite me; and I shall be des	1
ASV	Genesis	34	31	And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot?	1
ASV	Genesis	35	1	And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, who appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.	1
ASV	Genesis	35	2	Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments:	1
ASV	Genesis	35	3	and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.	1
ASV	Genesis	35	4	And they gave unto Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.	1
ASV	Genesis	35	5	And they journeyed: and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.	1
ASV	Genesis	35	6	So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (the same is Beth-el), he and all the people that were with him.	1
ASV	Genesis	35	7	And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el; because there God was revealed unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.	1
ASV	Genesis	35	8	And Deborah Rebekahs nurse died, and she was buried below Beth-el under the oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth.	1
ASV	Genesis	35	9	And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.	1
ASV	Genesis	35	10	And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.	1
ASV	Genesis	35	11	And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;	1
ASV	Genesis	35	12	and the land which I gave unto Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.	1
ASV	Genesis	35	13	And God went up from him in the place where he spake with him.	1
ASV	Genesis	35	14	And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spake with him, a pillar of stone: and he poured out a drink-offering thereon, and poured oil thereon.	1
ASV	Genesis	35	15	And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Beth-el.	1
ASV	Genesis	35	16	And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was still some distance to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.	1
ASV	Genesis	35	17	And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; for now thou shalt have another son.	1
ASV	Genesis	35	18	And it came to pass, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.	1
ASV	Genesis	35	19	And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).	1
ASV	Genesis	35	20	And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave: the same is the Pillar of Rachels grave unto this day.	1
ASV	Genesis	35	21	And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.	1
ASV	Genesis	35	22	And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his fathers concubine: and Israel heard of it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:	1
ASV	Genesis	35	23	The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacobs first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun;	1
ASV	Genesis	35	24	the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;	1
ASV	Genesis	35	25	and the sons of Bilhah, Rachels handmaid: Dan and Naphtali;	1
ASV	Genesis	35	26	and the sons of Zilpah, Leahs handmaid: Gad and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram.	1
ASV	Genesis	35	27	And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.	1
ASV	Genesis	35	28	And the days of Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years.	1
ASV	Genesis	35	29	And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, old and full of days: and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	1	Now these are the generations of Esau (the same is Edom).	1
ASV	Genesis	36	2	Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,	1
ASV	Genesis	36	3	and Basemath Ishmaels daughter, sister of Nebaioth.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	4	And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Basemath bare Reuel;	1
ASV	Genesis	36	5	and Oholibamah bare Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, that were born unto him in the land of Canaan.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	6	And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the souls of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his possessions, which he had gather in the land of Canaan; and went into a land away from his brother Jacob.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	7	For their substance was too great for them to dwell together; and the land of their sojournings could not bear them because of their cattle.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	8	And Esau dwelt in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	9	And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:	1
ASV	Genesis	36	10	these are the names of Esaus sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	11	And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	12	And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esaus son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these are the sons of Adah, Esaus wife.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	13	And these are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Basemath, Esaus wife.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	14	And these were the sons of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esaus wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	15	These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the first-born of Esau: chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,	1
ASV	Genesis	36	16	chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek: these are the chiefs that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Adah.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	17	And these are the sons of Reuel, Esaus son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah: these are the chiefs that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Basemath, Esaus wife.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	18	And these are the sons of Oholibamah, Esaus wife: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah: these are the chiefs that came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esaus wife.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	19	These are the sons of Esau, and these are their chiefs: the same is Edom.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	20	These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anah,	1
ASV	Genesis	36	21	and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan: these are the chiefs that came of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	22	And the children of Lotan were Hori and Heman. And Lotans sister was Timna.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	23	And these are the children of Shobal: Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and Onam.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	24	And these are the children of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah; this is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	25	And these are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	26	And these are the children of Dishon: Hemdan and Eshban and Ithran and Cheran.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	27	These are the children of Ezer: Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	28	These are the children of Dishan: Uz and Aran.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	29	These are the chiefs that came of the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah,	1
ASV	Genesis	36	30	chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan: these are the chiefs that came of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	31	And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	32	And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom; and the name of his city was Dinhabah.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	33	And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	34	And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	35	And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	36	And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	37	And Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth by the River reigned in his stead.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	38	And Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	39	And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wifes name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-zahab.	1
ASV	Genesis	36	40	And these are the names of the chiefs that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,	1
ASV	Genesis	36	41	chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,	1
ASV	Genesis	36	42	chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,	1
ASV	Genesis	36	43	chief Magdiel, chief Iram: these are the chiefs of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession. This is Esau, the father of the Edomites.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	1	And Jacob dwelt in the land of his fathers sojournings, in the land of Canaan.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	2	These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and he was a lad with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his fathers wives: and Joseph brought the evil report of them unto their	1
ASV	Genesis	37	3	Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	4	And his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren; and they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	5	And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	6	And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:	1
ASV	Genesis	37	7	for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves came round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	8	And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? Or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	9	And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed yet a dream: and, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to me.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	10	And he told it to his father, and to his brethren; and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?	1
ASV	Genesis	37	11	And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the saying in mind.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	12	And his brethren went to feed their fathers flock in Shechem.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	13	And Israel said unto Joseph, Are not thy brethren feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	14	And he said to him, Go now, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and well with the flock; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	15	And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?	1
ASV	Genesis	37	16	And he said, I am seeking my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they are feeding the flock.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	17	And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	18	And they saw him afar off, and before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	19	And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	20	Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, And evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	21	And Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, Let us not take his life.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	22	And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him: that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	23	And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him;	1
ASV	Genesis	37	24	and they took him, and cast him into the pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	25	And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	26	And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood?	1
ASV	Genesis	37	27	Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brethren hearkened unto him.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	28	And there passed by Midianites, merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	29	And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	30	And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?	1
ASV	Genesis	37	31	And they took Josephs coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the blood;	1
ASV	Genesis	37	32	and they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, This have we found: know now whether it is thy sons coat or not.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	33	And he knew it, and said, It is my sons coat: an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	34	And Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	35	And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down to Sheol to my son mourning. And his father wept for him.	1
ASV	Genesis	37	36	And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaohs, the captain of the guard.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	1	And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	2	And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. And he took her, and went in unto her.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	3	And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	4	And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	5	And she yet again bare a son, and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	6	And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, and her name was Tamar.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	7	And Er, Judahs first-born, was wicked in the sight of Jehovah. And Jehovah slew him.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	8	And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brothers wife, and perform the duty of a husbands brother unto her, and raise up seed to thy brother.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	9	And Onan knew that the seed would not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brothers wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	10	And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and he slew him also.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	11	Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in thy fathers house, till Shelah my son be grown up; for he said, Lest he also die, like his brethren. And Tamar went and dwelt in her fathers house.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	12	And in process of time Shuas daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheep-shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	13	And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnah to shear his sheep.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	14	And she put off from her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given unto him to wife.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	15	When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; for she had covered her face.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	16	And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee: for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?	1
ASV	Genesis	38	17	And he said, I will send thee a kid of the goats from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?	1
ASV	Genesis	38	18	And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet and thy cord, and thy staff that is in thy hand. And he gave them to her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	19	And she arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	20	And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the womans hand: but he found her not.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	21	Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the wayside? And they said, There hath been no prostitute here.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	22	And he returned to Judah, and said, I have not found her; and also the men of the place said, There hath been no prostitute here.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	23	And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be put to shame: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	24	And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and moreover, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	25	When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and the cords, and the staff.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	26	And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She is more righteous than I; forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	27	And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	28	And it came to pass, when she travailed, that one put out a hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	29	And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, Wherefore hast thou made a breach for thyself? Therefore his name was called Perez.	1
ASV	Genesis	38	30	And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zerah.	1
ASV	Genesis	39	1	And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaohs, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hand of the Ishmaelites, that had brought him down thither.	1
ASV	Genesis	39	2	And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.	1
ASV	Genesis	39	3	And his master saw that Jehovah was with him, and that Jehovah made all that he did to prosper in his hand.	1
ASV	Genesis	39	4	And Joseph found favor in his sight, and he ministered unto him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.	1
ASV	Genesis	39	5	And it came to pass from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that Jehovah blessed the Egyptians house for Josephs sake; and the blessing of Jehovah was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field.	1
ASV	Genesis	39	6	And he left all that he had in Josephs hand; and he knew not aught that was with him, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was comely, and well-favored.	1
ASV	Genesis	39	7	And it came to pass after these things, that his masters wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.	1
ASV	Genesis	39	8	But he refused, and said unto his masters wife, Behold, my master knoweth not what is with me in the house, and he hath put all that he hath into my hand:	1
ASV	Genesis	39	9	he is not greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back anything from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?	1
ASV	Genesis	39	10	And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.	1
ASV	Genesis	39	11	And it came to pass about this time, that he went into the house to do his work; and there was none of the men of the house there within.	1
ASV	Genesis	39	12	And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.	1
ASV	Genesis	39	13	And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,	1
ASV	Genesis	39	14	that she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us: he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:	1
ASV	Genesis	39	15	and it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled, and got him out.	1
ASV	Genesis	39	16	And she laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.	1
ASV	Genesis	39	17	And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, whom thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:	1
ASV	Genesis	39	18	and it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled out.	1
ASV	Genesis	39	19	And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.	1
ASV	Genesis	39	20	And Josephs master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the kings prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.	1
ASV	Genesis	39	21	But Jehovah was with Joseph, and showed kindness unto him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.	1
ASV	Genesis	39	22	And the keeper of the prison committed to Josephs hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.	1
ASV	Genesis	39	23	The keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand, because Jehovah was with him; and that which he did, Jehovah made it prosper.	1
ASV	Genesis	40	1	And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt.	1
ASV	Genesis	40	2	And Pharaoh was wroth against his two officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.	1
ASV	Genesis	40	3	And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.	1
ASV	Genesis	40	4	And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he ministered unto them: and they continued a season in ward.	1
ASV	Genesis	40	5	And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.	1
ASV	Genesis	40	6	And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and saw them, and, behold, they were sad.	1
ASV	Genesis	40	7	And he asked Pharaohs officers that were with him in ward in his masters house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sad to-day?	1
ASV	Genesis	40	8	And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell it me, I pray you.	1
ASV	Genesis	40	9	And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;	1
ASV	Genesis	40	10	and in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and its blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:	1
ASV	Genesis	40	11	and Pharaohs cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaohs cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaohs hand.	1
ASV	Genesis	40	12	And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days;	1
ASV	Genesis	40	13	within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee unto thine office: and thou shalt give Pharaohs cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.	1
ASV	Genesis	40	14	But have me in thy remembrance when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:	1
ASV	Genesis	40	15	for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.	1
ASV	Genesis	40	16	When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head:	1
ASV	Genesis	40	17	and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.	1
ASV	Genesis	40	18	And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: the three baskets are three days;	1
ASV	Genesis	40	19	within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.	1
ASV	Genesis	40	20	And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaohs birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants.	1
ASV	Genesis	40	21	And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaohs hand:	1
ASV	Genesis	40	22	but he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.	1
ASV	Genesis	40	23	Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	1	And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	2	And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, well-favored and fat-fleshed; and they fed in the reed-grass.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	3	And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed, and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	4	And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the seven well-favored and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	5	And he slept and dreamed a second time: and, behold, seven ears of grain came up upon one stalk, rank and good.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	6	And, behold, seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	7	And the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	8	And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	9	Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:	1
ASV	Genesis	41	10	Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker:	1
ASV	Genesis	41	11	and we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	12	And there was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	13	And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	14	Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	15	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	16	And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	17	And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the brink of the river:	1
ASV	Genesis	41	18	and, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fat-fleshed and well-favored: and they fed in the reed-grass:	1
ASV	Genesis	41	19	and, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill-favored and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:	1
ASV	Genesis	41	20	and the lean and ill-favored kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:	1
ASV	Genesis	41	21	and when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	22	And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up upon one stalk, full and good:	1
ASV	Genesis	41	23	and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:	1
ASV	Genesis	41	24	and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears: and I told it unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	25	And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: what God is about to do he hath declared unto Pharaoh.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	26	The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	27	And the seven lean and ill-favored kine that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind; they shall be seven years of famine.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	28	That is the thing which I spake unto Pharaoh: what God is about to do he hath showed unto Pharaoh.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	29	Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:	1
ASV	Genesis	41	30	and there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;	1
ASV	Genesis	41	31	and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine which followeth; for it shall be very grievous.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	32	And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh, it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	33	Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	34	Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	35	And let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	36	And the food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	37	And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	38	And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom the spirit of God is?	1
ASV	Genesis	41	39	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath showed thee all of this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou:	1
ASV	Genesis	41	40	thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	41	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	42	And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it upon Josephs hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;	1
ASV	Genesis	41	43	and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he set him over all the land of Egypt.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	44	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	45	And Pharaoh called Josephs name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	46	And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	47	And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	48	And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	49	And Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left off numbering; for it was without number.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	50	And unto Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bare unto him.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	51	And Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh: For, said he, God hath made me forget all my toil, and all my fathers house.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	52	And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	53	And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	54	And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said: and there was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	55	And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	56	And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the store-houses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine was sore in the land of Egypt.	1
ASV	Genesis	41	57	And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was sore in all the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	1	Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?	1
ASV	Genesis	42	2	And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	3	And Josephs ten brethren went down to buy grain from Egypt.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	4	But Benjamin, Josephs brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest Peradventure harm befall him.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	5	And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	6	And Joseph was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the people of the land. And Josephs brethren came, and bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	7	And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly with them; and he said unto them. Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	8	And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	9	And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	10	And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	11	We are all one mans sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	12	And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	13	And they said, We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	14	And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:	1
ASV	Genesis	42	15	hereby ye shall be proved: by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	16	Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be bound, that your words may be proved, whether there be truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	17	And he put them all together into ward three days.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	18	And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live: for I fear God:	1
ASV	Genesis	42	19	if ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in your prison-house; but go ye, carry grain for the famine of your houses:	1
ASV	Genesis	42	20	and bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	21	And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	22	And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore also, behold, his blood is required.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	23	And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	24	And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and spake to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	25	Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with grain, and to restore every mans money into his sack, and to give them provisions for the way: and thus was it done unto them.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	26	And they laded their asses with their grain, and departed thence.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	27	And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodging-place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	28	And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, What is this that God hath done unto us?	1
ASV	Genesis	42	29	And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying,	1
ASV	Genesis	42	30	The man, the lord of the land, spake roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	31	And we said unto him, We are true men; and we are no spies:	1
ASV	Genesis	42	32	we are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	33	And the man, the lord of the land, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men: leave one of your brethren with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way;	1
ASV	Genesis	42	34	and bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffic in the land.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	35	And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every mans bundle of money was in his sack: and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	36	And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	37	And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.	1
ASV	Genesis	42	38	And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left: if harm befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.	1
ASV	Genesis	43	1	And the famine was sore in the land.	1
ASV	Genesis	43	2	And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.	1
ASV	Genesis	43	3	And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.	1
ASV	Genesis	43	4	If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:	1
ASV	Genesis	43	5	but if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down; for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.	1
ASV	Genesis	43	6	And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?	1
ASV	Genesis	43	7	And they said, The man asked straitly concerning ourselves, and concerning our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we in any wise know that he would say, Bring yo	1
ASV	Genesis	43	8	And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.	1
ASV	Genesis	43	9	I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:	1
ASV	Genesis	43	10	for except we had lingered, surely we had now returned a second time.	1
ASV	Genesis	43	11	And their father Israel said unto them, If it be so now, do this: take of the choice fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spicery and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;	1
ASV	Genesis	43	12	and take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:	1
ASV	Genesis	43	13	take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:	1
ASV	Genesis	43	14	and God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release unto you your other brother and Benjamin. And if I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.	1
ASV	Genesis	43	15	And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.	1
ASV	Genesis	43	16	And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, Bring the men into the house, and slay, and make ready; for the men shall dine with me at noon.	1
ASV	Genesis	43	17	And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men to Josephs house.	1
ASV	Genesis	43	18	And the men were afraid, because they were brought to Josephs house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, a	1
ASV	Genesis	43	19	And they came near to the steward of Josephs house, and they spake unto him at the door of the house,	1
ASV	Genesis	43	20	and said, Oh, my lord, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:	1
ASV	Genesis	43	21	and it came to pass, when we came to the lodging-place, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every mans money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.	1
ASV	Genesis	43	22	And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food: we know not who put our money in our sacks.	1
ASV	Genesis	43	23	And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.	1
ASV	Genesis	43	24	And the man brought the men into Josephs house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. And he gave their asses provender.	1
ASV	Genesis	43	25	And they made ready the present against Josephs coming at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.	1
ASV	Genesis	43	26	And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed down themselves to him to the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	43	27	And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?	1
ASV	Genesis	43	28	And they said, Thy servant our father is well, he is yet alive. And they bowed the head, and made obeisance.	1
ASV	Genesis	43	29	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mothers son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.	1
ASV	Genesis	43	30	And Joseph made haste; for his heart yearned over his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.	1
ASV	Genesis	43	31	And he washed his face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.	1
ASV	Genesis	43	32	And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, that did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.	1
ASV	Genesis	43	33	And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one with another.	1
ASV	Genesis	43	34	And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamins mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	1	And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the mens sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every mans money in his sacks mouth.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	2	And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sacks mouth of the youngest, and his grain money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	3	As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	4	And when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?	1
ASV	Genesis	44	5	Is not this that in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	6	And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these words.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	7	And they said unto him, Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? Far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	8	Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lords house silver or gold?	1
ASV	Genesis	44	9	With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lords bondmen.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	10	And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	11	Then they hasted, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	12	And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamins sack.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	13	Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	14	And Judah and his brethren came to Josephs house; and he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	15	And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I can indeed divine?	1
ASV	Genesis	44	16	And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lords bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	17	And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	18	Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh, my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lords ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	19	My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?	1
ASV	Genesis	44	20	And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loveth him.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	21	And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	22	And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	23	And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	24	And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	25	And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	26	And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the mans face, expect our youngest brother be with us.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	27	And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:	1
ASV	Genesis	44	28	and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since:	1
ASV	Genesis	44	29	and if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	30	Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lads life;	1
ASV	Genesis	44	31	it will come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	32	For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	33	Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.	1
ASV	Genesis	44	34	For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? lest I see the evil that shall come on my father.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	1	Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood before him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	2	And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	3	And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	4	And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	5	And now be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	6	For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and there are yet five years, in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	7	And God sent me before you to preserve you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	8	So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	9	Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not;	1
ASV	Genesis	45	10	and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy childrens children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:	1
ASV	Genesis	45	11	and there will I nourish thee; for there are yet five years of famine; lest thou come to poverty, thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	12	And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	13	And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen: and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	14	And he fell upon his brother Benjamins neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	15	And he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	16	And the report thereof was heard in Pharaohs house, saying, Josephs brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	17	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye: lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;	1
ASV	Genesis	45	18	and take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	19	Now thou art commanded, this do ye: take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	20	Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	21	And the sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	22	To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	23	And to his father he sent after this manner: ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	24	So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	25	And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	26	And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he believed them not.	1
ASV	Genesis	45	27	And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:	1
ASV	Genesis	45	28	and Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	1	And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	2	And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	3	And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:	1
ASV	Genesis	46	4	I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	5	And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	6	And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:	1
ASV	Genesis	46	7	his sons, and his sons sons with him, his daughters, and his sonss daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	8	And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacobs first-born.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	9	And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	10	And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	11	And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	12	And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	13	And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puvah, and Iob, and Shimron.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	14	And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	15	These are the sons of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	16	And the sons of Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	17	And the sons of Asher: Imnah, and Ishvah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and Serah their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber, and Malchiel.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	18	These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	19	The sons of Rachel Jacobs wife: Joseph and Benjamin.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	20	And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On, bare unto him.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	21	And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	22	These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	23	And the sons of Dan: Hushim.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	24	And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	25	These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	26	All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, that came out of his loins, besides Jacobs sons wives, all the souls were threescore and six;	1
ASV	Genesis	46	27	and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	28	And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to show the way before him unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	29	And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen; and he presented himself unto him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	30	And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, that thou art yet alive.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	31	And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his fathers house, I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and will say unto him, My brethren, and my fathers house, who were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;	1
ASV	Genesis	46	32	and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.	1
ASV	Genesis	46	33	And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?	1
ASV	Genesis	46	34	that ye shall say, Thy servants have been keepers of cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	1	Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	2	And from among his brethren he took five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	3	And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	4	And they said unto Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land are we come; for there is no pasture for thy servants flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	5	And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:	1
ASV	Genesis	47	6	the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and thy brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	7	And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	8	And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How many are the days of the years of thy life?	1
ASV	Genesis	47	9	And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of the	1
ASV	Genesis	47	10	And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	11	And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	12	And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his fathers household, with bread, according to their families.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	13	And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	14	And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaohs house.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	15	And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for our money faileth.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	16	And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	17	And they brought their cattle unto Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	18	And when that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my lords; there is nought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and ou	1
ASV	Genesis	47	19	wherefore should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land be not desolate.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	20	So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine was sore upon them: and the land became Pharaohs.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	21	And as for the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end thereof.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	22	Only the land of the priests bought he not: for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them; wherefore they sold not their land.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	23	Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	24	And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye shall give a fifth unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	25	And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaohs servants.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	26	And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone became not Pharaohs.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	27	And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they gat them possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	28	And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred forty and seven years.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	29	And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me: bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt;	1
ASV	Genesis	47	30	but when I sleep with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.	1
ASV	Genesis	47	31	And he said, Swear unto me: and he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the beds head.	1
ASV	Genesis	48	1	And it came to pass after these things, that one said to Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.	1
ASV	Genesis	48	2	And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.	1
ASV	Genesis	48	3	And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,	1
ASV	Genesis	48	4	and said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples, and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.	1
ASV	Genesis	48	5	And now thy two sons, who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine.	1
ASV	Genesis	48	6	And thy issue, that thou begettest after them, shall be thine; they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.	1
ASV	Genesis	48	7	And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was still some distance to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).	1
ASV	Genesis	48	8	And Israel beheld Josephs sons, and said, Who are these?	1
ASV	Genesis	48	9	And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me here. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.	1
ASV	Genesis	48	10	Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.	1
ASV	Genesis	48	11	And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath let me see thy seed also.	1
ASV	Genesis	48	12	And Joseph brought them out from between his knees; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	48	13	And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israels left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israels right hand, and brought them near unto him.	1
ASV	Genesis	48	14	And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraims head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manassehs head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the first-born.	1
ASV	Genesis	48	15	And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who hath fed me all my life long unto this day,	1
ASV	Genesis	48	16	the angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.	1
ASV	Genesis	48	17	And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his fathers hand, to remove it from Ephraims head unto Manassehs head.	1
ASV	Genesis	48	18	And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father; for this is the first-born; put thy right hand upon his head.	1
ASV	Genesis	48	19	And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: howbeit his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.	1
ASV	Genesis	48	20	And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee will Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.	1
ASV	Genesis	48	21	And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God will be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.	1
ASV	Genesis	48	22	Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	1	And Jacob called unto his sons, and said: gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the latter days.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	2	Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; And hearken unto Israel your father.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	3	Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength; The pre-eminence of dignity, and the pre-eminence of power.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	4	Boiling over as water, thou shalt not have the pre-eminence; Because thou wentest up to thy fathers bed; Then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	5	Simeon and Levi are brethren; Weapons of violence are their swords.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	6	O my soul, come not thou into their council; Unto their assembly, my glory, be not thou united; For in their anger they slew a man, And in their self-will they hocked an ox.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	7	Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; And their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, And scatter them in Israel.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	8	Judah, thee shall thy brethren praise: Thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies; Thy fathers sons shall bow down before thee.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	9	Judah is a lions whelp; From the prey, my son, thou art gone up: He stooped down, he couched as a lion, And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?	1
ASV	Genesis	49	10	The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, Nor the rulers staff from between his feet, Until Shiloh come: And unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	11	Binding his foal unto the vine, And his asss colt unto the choice vine; He hath washed his garments in wine, And his vesture in the blood of grapes:	1
ASV	Genesis	49	12	His eyes shall be red with wine, And his teeth white with milk.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	13	Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; And he shall be for a haven of ships; And his border shall be upon Sidon.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	14	Issachar is a strong ass, Couching down between the sheepfolds:	1
ASV	Genesis	49	15	And he saw a resting-place that it was good, And the land that it was pleasant; And he bowed his shoulder to bear, And became a servant under taskwork.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	16	Dan shall judge his people, As one of the tribes of Israel.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	17	Dan shall be a serpent in the way, An adder in the path, That biteth the horses heels, So that his rider falleth backward.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	18	I have waited for thy salvation, O Jehovah.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	19	Gad, a troop shall press upon him; But he shall press upon their heel.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	20	Out of the Asher his bread shall be fat, And he shall yield royal dainties.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	21	Naphtali is a hind let loose: He giveth goodly words.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	22	Joseph is a fruitful bough, A fruitful bough by a fountain; His branches run over the wall.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	23	The archers have sorely grieved him, And shot at him, and persecute him:	1
ASV	Genesis	49	24	But his bow abode in strength, And the arms of his hands were made strong, By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, (From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel),	1
ASV	Genesis	49	25	Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee, And by the Almighty, who shall bless thee, With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath, Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	26	The blessings of thy father Have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors Unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: They shall be on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	27	Benjamin is a wolf that raveneth: In the morning she shall devour the prey, And at even he shall divide the spoil.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	28	All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	29	And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,	1
ASV	Genesis	49	30	in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burying-place.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	31	there they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah:	1
ASV	Genesis	49	32	the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth.	1
ASV	Genesis	49	33	And when Jacob made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.	1
ASV	Genesis	50	1	And Joseph fell upon his fathers face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.	1
ASV	Genesis	50	2	And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.	1
ASV	Genesis	50	3	And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of embalming: and the Egyptians wept for him three-score and ten days.	1
ASV	Genesis	50	4	And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found favor in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,	1
ASV	Genesis	50	5	My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.	1
ASV	Genesis	50	6	And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.	1
ASV	Genesis	50	7	And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,	1
ASV	Genesis	50	8	and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his fathers house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.	1
ASV	Genesis	50	9	And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.	1
ASV	Genesis	50	10	And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.	1
ASV	Genesis	50	11	And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.	1
ASV	Genesis	50	12	And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:	1
ASV	Genesis	50	13	for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a possession of a burying-place, of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.	1
ASV	Genesis	50	14	And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.	1
ASV	Genesis	50	15	And when Josephs brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully requite us all the evil which we did unto him.	1
ASV	Genesis	50	16	And they sent a message unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,	1
ASV	Genesis	50	17	So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin, for that they did unto thee evil. And now, we pray thee, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they	1
ASV	Genesis	50	18	And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we are thy servants.	1
ASV	Genesis	50	19	And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?	1
ASV	Genesis	50	20	And as for you, ye meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.	1
ASV	Genesis	50	21	Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.	1
ASV	Genesis	50	22	And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his fathers house: and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.	1
ASV	Genesis	50	23	And Joseph saw Ephraims children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Josephs knees.	1
ASV	Genesis	50	24	And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die; but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.	1
ASV	Genesis	50	25	And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.	1
ASV	Genesis	50	26	So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.	1
ASV	Exodus	1	1	Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob):	2
ASV	Exodus	1	2	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,	2
ASV	Exodus	1	3	Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,	2
ASV	Exodus	1	4	Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.	2
ASV	Exodus	1	5	And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: and Joseph was in Egypt already.	2
ASV	Exodus	1	6	And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.	2
ASV	Exodus	1	7	And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.	2
ASV	Exodus	1	8	Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.	2
ASV	Exodus	1	9	And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:	2
ASV	Exodus	1	10	come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they also join themselves unto our enemies, and fight against us, and get them up out of the land.	2
ASV	Exodus	1	11	Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh store-cities, Pithom and Raamses.	2
ASV	Exodus	1	12	But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.	2
ASV	Exodus	1	13	And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor:	2
ASV	Exodus	1	14	and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field, all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigor.	2
ASV	Exodus	1	15	And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:	2
ASV	Exodus	1	16	and he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the birth-stool; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.	2
ASV	Exodus	1	17	But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men-children alive.	2
ASV	Exodus	1	18	And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men-children alive?	2
ASV	Exodus	1	19	And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwife come unto them.	2
ASV	Exodus	1	20	And God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.	2
ASV	Exodus	1	21	And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them households.	2
ASV	Exodus	1	22	And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.	2
ASV	Exodus	2	1	And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.	2
ASV	Exodus	2	2	And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.	2
ASV	Exodus	2	3	And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid it in the flags by the rivers brink.	2
ASV	Exodus	2	4	And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.	2
ASV	Exodus	2	5	And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river-side; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her handmaid to fetch it.	2
ASV	Exodus	2	6	And she opened it, and saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews children.	2
ASV	Exodus	2	7	Then said his sister to Pharaohs daughter, Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?	2
ASV	Exodus	2	8	And Pharaohs daughter said to her, Go. And the maiden went and called the childs mother.	2
ASV	Exodus	2	9	And Pharaohs daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.	2
ASV	Exodus	2	10	And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaohs daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water.	2
ASV	Exodus	2	11	And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.	2
ASV	Exodus	2	12	And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.	2
ASV	Exodus	2	13	And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?	2
ASV	Exodus	2	14	And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Thinkest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known.	2
ASV	Exodus	2	15	Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.	2
ASV	Exodus	2	16	Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their fathers flock.	2
ASV	Exodus	2	17	And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.	2
ASV	Exodus	2	18	And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to-day?	2
ASV	Exodus	2	19	And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.	2
ASV	Exodus	2	20	And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.	2
ASV	Exodus	2	21	And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.	2
ASV	Exodus	2	22	And she bare a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.	2
ASV	Exodus	2	23	And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.	2
ASV	Exodus	2	24	And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.	2
ASV	Exodus	2	25	And God saw the children of Israel, and God took knowledge of them.	2
ASV	Exodus	3	1	Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to the mountain of God, unto Horeb.	2
ASV	Exodus	3	2	And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.	2
ASV	Exodus	3	3	And Moses said, I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.	2
ASV	Exodus	3	4	And when Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.	2
ASV	Exodus	3	5	And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.	2
ASV	Exodus	3	6	Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.	2
ASV	Exodus	3	7	And Jehovah said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people that are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;	2
ASV	Exodus	3	8	and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Pe	2
ASV	Exodus	3	9	And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: moreover I have seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.	2
ASV	Exodus	3	10	Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	3	11	And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?	2
ASV	Exodus	3	12	And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be the token unto thee, that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.	2
ASV	Exodus	3	13	And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? What shall I say unto them?	2
ASV	Exodus	3	14	And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.	2
ASV	Exodus	3	15	And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name forever, and this is my memorial unto a	2
ASV	Exodus	3	16	Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, hath appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:	2
ASV	Exodus	3	17	and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.	2
ASV	Exodus	3	18	And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, hath met with us: and now let us go, we pray thee, three days journey into the wil	2
ASV	Exodus	3	19	And I know that the king of Egypt will not give you leave to go, no, not by a mighty hand.	2
ASV	Exodus	3	20	And I will put forth my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.	2
ASV	Exodus	3	21	And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.	2
ASV	Exodus	3	22	But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall despoil the Egyptians.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	1	And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they will say, Jehovah hath not appeared unto thee.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	2	And Jehovah said unto him, What is that in thy hand? And he said, A rod.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	3	And he said, Cast in on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	4	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Put forth thy hand, and take it by the tail: (and he put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand:)	2
ASV	Exodus	4	5	That they may believe that Jehovah, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	6	And Jehovah said furthermore unto him, Put now thy hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	7	And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. (And he put his hand into his bosom again; and when he took it out of his bosom, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.)	2
ASV	Exodus	4	8	And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	9	And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe even these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood up	2
ASV	Exodus	4	10	And Moses said unto Jehovah, Oh, Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	11	And Jehovah said unto him, Who hath made mans mouth? Or who maketh a man dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, Jehovah?	2
ASV	Exodus	4	12	Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt speak.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	13	And he said, Oh, Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	14	And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is there not Aaron thy brother the Levite? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	15	And thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	16	And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people; and it shall come to pass, that he shall be to thee a mouth, and thou shalt be to him as God.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	17	And thou shalt take in thy hand this rod, wherewith thou shalt do the signs.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	18	And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren that are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	19	And Jehovah said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt; for all the men are dead that sought thy life.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	20	And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	21	And Jehovah said unto Moses, When thou goest back into Egypt, see that thou do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in thy hand: but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	22	And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah, Israel is my son, my first-born:	2
ASV	Exodus	4	23	and I have said unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me; and thou hast refused to let him go: behold, I will slay thy son, thy first-born.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	24	And it came to pass on the way at the lodging-place, that Jehovah met him, and sought to kill him.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	25	Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, Surely a bridegroom of blood art thou to me.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	26	So he let him alone. Then she said, A bridegroom of blood art thou, because of the circumcision.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	27	And Jehovah said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mountain of God, and kissed him.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	28	And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah wherewith he had sent him, and all the signs wherewith he had charged him.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	29	And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:	2
ASV	Exodus	4	30	and Aaron spake all the words which Jehovah had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.	2
ASV	Exodus	4	31	And the people believed: and when they heard that Jehovah had visited the children of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.	2
ASV	Exodus	5	1	And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said unto Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.	2
ASV	Exodus	5	2	And Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah, that I should hearken unto his voice to let Israel go? I know not Jehovah, and moreover I will not let Israel go.	2
ASV	Exodus	5	3	And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice unto Jehovah our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.	2
ASV	Exodus	5	4	And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, loose the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.	2
ASV	Exodus	5	5	And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land are now many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.	2
ASV	Exodus	5	6	And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,	2
ASV	Exodus	5	7	Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.	2
ASV	Exodus	5	8	And the number of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof: for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.	2
ASV	Exodus	5	9	Let heavier work be laid upon the men, that they may labor therein; and let them not regard lying words.	2
ASV	Exodus	5	10	And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.	2
ASV	Exodus	5	11	Go yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it: for nought of your work shall be diminished.	2
ASV	Exodus	5	12	So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.	2
ASV	Exodus	5	13	And the taskmasters were urgent saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.	2
ASV	Exodus	5	14	And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaohs taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task both yesterday and to-day, in making brick as heretofore?	2
ASV	Exodus	5	15	Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?	2
ASV	Exodus	5	16	There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault it in thine own people.	2
ASV	Exodus	5	17	But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice to Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	5	18	Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the number of bricks.	2
ASV	Exodus	5	19	And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, when it was said, Ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks, your daily tasks.	2
ASV	Exodus	5	20	And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:	2
ASV	Exodus	5	21	and they said unto them, Jehovah look upon you, and judge: because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.	2
ASV	Exodus	5	22	And Moses returned unto Jehovah, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou dealt ill with this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?	2
ASV	Exodus	5	23	For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath dealt ill with this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	1	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for by a strong hand shall he let them go, and by a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	2	And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am Jehovah:	2
ASV	Exodus	6	3	and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name Jehovah I was not known to them.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	4	And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, wherein they sojourned.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	5	And moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	6	Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments:	2
ASV	Exodus	6	7	and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God, who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	8	And I will bring you in unto the land which I sware to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for a heritage: I am Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	9	And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	10	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	2
ASV	Exodus	6	11	Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	12	And Moses spake before Jehovah, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?	2
ASV	Exodus	6	13	And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	14	These are the heads of their fathers houses. The sons of Reuben the first-born of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	15	And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman; these are the families of Simeon.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	16	And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari; and the years of the life of Levi were a hundred thirty and seven years.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	17	The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to their families.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	18	And the sons of Kohath: Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel; and the years of the life of Kohath were a hundred thirty and three years.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	19	And the sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	20	And Amram took him Jochebed his fathers sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty and seven years.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	21	And the sons of Izhar: Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	22	And the sons of Uzziel: Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	23	And Aaron took him Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	24	And the sons of Korah: Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	25	And Eleazar Aarons son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers houses of the Levites according to their families.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	26	These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom Jehovah said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	27	These are they that spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	28	And it came to pass on the day when Jehovah spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt,	2
ASV	Exodus	6	29	that Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, I am Jehovah: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak unto thee.	2
ASV	Exodus	6	30	And Moses said before Jehovah, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?	2
ASV	Exodus	7	1	And Jehovah said unto Moses, See, I have made thee as God to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.	2
ASV	Exodus	7	2	Thou shalt speak all that I command thee; and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.	2
ASV	Exodus	7	3	And I will harden Pharaohs heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	7	4	But Pharaoh will not hearken unto you, and I will lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth my hosts, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.	2
ASV	Exodus	7	5	And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.	2
ASV	Exodus	7	6	And Moses and Aaron did so; as Jehovah commanded them, so did they.	2
ASV	Exodus	7	7	And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.	2
ASV	Exodus	7	8	And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,	2
ASV	Exodus	7	9	When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Show a wonder for you; then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent.	2
ASV	Exodus	7	10	And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so, as Jehovah had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.	2
ASV	Exodus	7	11	Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers: and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did in like manner with their enchantments.	2
ASV	Exodus	7	12	For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aarons rod swallowed up their rods.	2
ASV	Exodus	7	13	And Pharaohs heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as Jehovah had spoken.	2
ASV	Exodus	7	14	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pharaohs heart is stubborn, he refuseth to let the people go.	2
ASV	Exodus	7	15	Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the rivers brink to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thy hand.	2
ASV	Exodus	7	16	And thou shalt say unto him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou hast not hearkened.	2
ASV	Exodus	7	17	Thus saith Jehovah, In this thou shalt know that I am Jehovah: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.	2
ASV	Exodus	7	18	And the fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall become foul; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river.	2
ASV	Exodus	7	19	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their ponds of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be bl	2
ASV	Exodus	7	20	And Moses and Aaron did so, as Jehovah commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.	2
ASV	Exodus	7	21	And the fish that were in the river died; and the river became foul, and the Egyptians could not drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	7	22	And the magicians of Egypt did in like manner with their enchantments: and Pharaohs heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as Jehovah had spoken.	2
ASV	Exodus	7	23	And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he lay even this to heart.	2
ASV	Exodus	7	24	And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.	2
ASV	Exodus	7	25	And seven days were fulfilled, after that Jehovah had smitten the river.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let my people go, that they may serve me.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	2	And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:	2
ASV	Exodus	8	3	and the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs:	2
ASV	Exodus	8	4	and the frogs shall come up both upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	5	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	6	And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	7	And the magicians did in like manner with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	8	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat Jehovah, that he take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice unto Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	9	And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Have thou this glory over me: against what time shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs be destroyed from thee and thy houses, and remain in the river only?	2
ASV	Exodus	8	10	And he said, Against to-morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like unto Jehovah our God.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	11	And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	12	And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto Jehovah concerning the frogs which he had brought upon Pharaoh.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	13	And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	14	And they gathered them together in heaps; and the land stank.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	15	But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them, as Jehovah had spoken.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	16	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the earth, that is may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	17	And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and there were lice upon man, and upon beast; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	18	And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: and there were lice upon man, and upon beast.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	19	Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaohs heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as Jehovah had spoken.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	20	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let my people go, that they may serve me.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	21	Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon they servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they ar	2
ASV	Exodus	8	22	And I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the earth.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	23	And I will put a division between my people and thy people: by to-morrow shall this sign be.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	24	And Jehovah did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants houses: and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	25	And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	26	And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?	2
ASV	Exodus	8	27	We will go three days journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah our God, as he shall command us.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	28	And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to Jehovah your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: entreat for me.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	29	And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat Jehovah that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to-morrow: only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacr	2
ASV	Exodus	8	30	And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	31	And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.	2
ASV	Exodus	8	32	And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	1	Then Jehovah said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	2	For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,	2
ASV	Exodus	9	3	behold, the hand of Jehovah is upon thy cattle which are in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the herds, and upon the flocks: there shall be a very grievous murrain.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	4	And Jehovah shall make a distinction between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt; and there shall nothing die of all that belongeth to the children of Israel.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	5	And Jehovah appointed a set time, saying, To-morrow Jehovah shall do this thing in the land.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	6	And Jehovah did that thing on the morrow; and all the cattle of Egypt died; but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	7	And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not let the people go.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	8	And Jehovah said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	9	And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	10	And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	11	And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	12	And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them, as Jehovah had spoken unto Moses.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	13	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	14	For I will this time send all my plagues upon thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	15	For now I had put forth my hand, and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence, and thou hadst been cut off from the earth:	2
ASV	Exodus	9	16	but in very deed for this cause have I made thee to stand, to show thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	17	As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?	2
ASV	Exodus	9	18	Behold, to-morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	19	Now therefore send, hasten in thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field; for every man and beast that shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	20	He that feared the word of Jehovah among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	21	And he that regarded not the word of Jehovah left his servants and his cattle in the field.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	22	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch forth thy hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	23	And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and Jehovah sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down unto the earth; and Jehovah rained hail upon the land of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	24	So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	25	And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	26	Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	27	And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: Jehovah is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	28	Entreat Jehovah; for there hath been enough of these mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	29	And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto Jehovah; the thunders shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know that the earth is Jehovahs.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	30	But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear Jehovah God.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	31	And the flax and the barley were smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	32	But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten: for they were not grown up.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	33	And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto Jehovah: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	34	And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.	2
ASV	Exodus	9	35	And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the children of Israel go, as Jehovah had spoken by Moses.	2
ASV	Exodus	10	1	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I may show these my signs in the midst of them,	2
ASV	Exodus	10	2	and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy sons son, what things I have wrought upon Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know that I am Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	10	3	And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.	2
ASV	Exodus	10	4	Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to-morrow will I bring locusts into thy border:	2
ASV	Exodus	10	5	and they shall cover the face of the earth, so that one shall not be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:	2
ASV	Exodus	10	6	and thy houses shall be filled, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither thy fathers nor thy fathers fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned, and went out from	2
ASV	Exodus	10	7	And Pharaohs servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve Jehovah their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?	2
ASV	Exodus	10	8	And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve Jehovah your God; but who are they that shall go?	2
ASV	Exodus	10	9	And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	10	10	And he said unto them, So be Jehovah with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.	2
ASV	Exodus	10	11	Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve Jehovah; for that is what ye desire. And they were driven out from Pharaohs presence.	2
ASV	Exodus	10	12	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.	2
ASV	Exodus	10	13	And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.	2
ASV	Exodus	10	14	And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt; very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.	2
ASV	Exodus	10	15	For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing, either tree or herb of the field, through	2
ASV	Exodus	10	16	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against Jehovah your God, and against you.	2
ASV	Exodus	10	17	Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat Jehovah your God, that he may take away from me this death only.	2
ASV	Exodus	10	18	And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	10	19	And Jehovah turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea; there remained not one locust in all the border of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	10	20	But Jehovah hardened Pharaohs heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go.	2
ASV	Exodus	10	21	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.	2
ASV	Exodus	10	22	And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days;	2
ASV	Exodus	10	23	they saw not one another, neither rose any one from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.	2
ASV	Exodus	10	24	And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve Jehovah; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.	2
ASV	Exodus	10	25	And Moses said, Thou must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt-offerings, that we may sacrifice unto Jehovah our God.	2
ASV	Exodus	10	26	Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind: for thereof must we take to serve Jehovah our God; and we know not with what we must serve Jehovah, until we come thither.	2
ASV	Exodus	10	27	But Jehovah hardened Pharaohs heart, and he would not let them go.	2
ASV	Exodus	10	28	And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in the day thou seest my face thou shalt die.	2
ASV	Exodus	10	29	And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well. I will see thy face again no more.	2
ASV	Exodus	11	1	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.	2
ASV	Exodus	11	2	Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.	2
ASV	Exodus	11	3	And Jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaohs servants, and in the sight of the people.	2
ASV	Exodus	11	4	And Moses said, Thus saith Jehovah, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:	2
ASV	Exodus	11	5	and all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill; and all the first-born of cattle.	2
ASV	Exodus	11	6	And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there hath not been, nor shall be any more.	2
ASV	Exodus	11	7	But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that Jehovah doth make a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel.	2
ASV	Exodus	11	8	And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.	2
ASV	Exodus	11	9	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pharaoh will not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	11	10	And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and Jehovah hardened Pharaohs heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go out of his land.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,	2
ASV	Exodus	12	2	This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	3	Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers houses, a lamb for a household:	2
ASV	Exodus	12	4	and if the household be too little for a lamb, then shall he and his neighbor next unto his house take one according to the number of the souls; according to every mans eating ye shall make your count for the lamb.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	5	Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old: ye shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats:	2
ASV	Exodus	12	6	and ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at even.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	7	And they shall take of the blood, and put it on the two side-posts and on the lintel, upon the houses wherein they shall eat it.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	8	And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter herbs they shall eat it.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	9	Eat not of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roast with fire; its head with its legs and with the inwards thereof.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	10	And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	11	And thus shall ye eat it: with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is Jehovahs passover.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	12	For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	13	And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there shall no plague be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	14	And this day shall be unto you for a memorial, and ye shall keep it a feast to Jehovah: throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	15	Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	16	And in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	17	And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance for ever.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	18	In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	19	Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a sojourner, or one that is born in the land.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	20	Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	21	Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out, and take you lambs according to your families, and kill the passover.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	22	And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	23	For Jehovah will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side-posts, Jehovah will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	24	And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	25	And it shall come to pass, when ye are come to the land which Jehovah will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	26	And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?	2
ASV	Exodus	12	27	that ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of Jehovahs passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	28	And the children of Israel went and did so; as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	29	And it came to pass at midnight, that Jehovah smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the first-born of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the first-born of cattle.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	30	And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	31	And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve Jehovah, as ye have said.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	32	Take both your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	33	And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, to send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We are all dead men.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	34	And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading-troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	35	And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	36	And Jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. And they despoiled the Egyptians.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	37	And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, besides children.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	38	And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	39	And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt; for it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victuals.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	40	Now the time that the children of Israel dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	41	And it came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of Jehovah went out from the land of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	42	It is a night to be much observed unto Jehovah for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of Jehovah, to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their generations.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	43	And Jehovah said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: there shall no foreigner eat thereof;	2
ASV	Exodus	12	44	but every mans servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	45	A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	46	In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	47	All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	48	And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to Jehovah, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: but no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	49	One law shall be to him that is home-born, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	50	Thus did all the children of Israel; as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.	2
ASV	Exodus	12	51	And it came to pass the selfsame day, that Jehovah did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts.	2
ASV	Exodus	13	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	2
ASV	Exodus	13	2	Sanctify unto me all the first-born, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.	2
ASV	Exodus	13	3	And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand Jehovah brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.	2
ASV	Exodus	13	4	This day ye go forth in the month Abib.	2
ASV	Exodus	13	5	And it shall be, when Jehovah shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this	2
ASV	Exodus	13	6	Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	13	7	Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee, in all thy borders.	2
ASV	Exodus	13	8	And thou shalt tell thy son in that day, saying, It is because of that which Jehovah did for me when I came forth out of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	13	9	And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the law of Jehovah may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath Jehovah brought thee out of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	13	10	Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.	2
ASV	Exodus	13	11	And it shall be, when Jehovah shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee,	2
ASV	Exodus	13	12	that thou shalt set apart unto Jehovah all that openeth the womb, and every firstling which thou hast that cometh of a beast; the males shall be Jehovahs.	2
ASV	Exodus	13	13	And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck: and all the first-born of man among thy sons shalt thou redeem.	2
ASV	Exodus	13	14	And it shall be, when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand Jehovah brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:	2
ASV	Exodus	13	15	and it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that Jehovah slew all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both the first-born of man, and the first-born of beast: therefore I sacrifice to Jehovah all that openeth the womb, being males; but all	2
ASV	Exodus	13	16	And it shall be for a sign upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand Jehovah brought us forth out of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	13	17	And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:	2
ASV	Exodus	13	18	but God led the people about, by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea: and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	13	19	And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.	2
ASV	Exodus	13	20	And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.	2
ASV	Exodus	13	21	And Jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, that they might go by day and by night:	2
ASV	Exodus	13	22	the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, departed not from before the people.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	2
ASV	Exodus	14	2	Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-zephon: over against it shall ye encamp by the sea.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	3	And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	4	And I will harden Pharaohs heart, and he shall follow after them; and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host: and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah. And they did so.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	5	And it was told the king of Egypt that the people were fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed towards the people, and they said, What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?	2
ASV	Exodus	14	6	And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:	2
ASV	Exodus	14	7	and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	8	And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: for the children of Israel went out with a high hand.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	9	And the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal-zephon.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	10	And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	11	And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt?	2
ASV	Exodus	14	12	Is not this the word that we spake unto thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	13	And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah, which he will work for you to-day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to-day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	14	Jehovah will fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	15	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	16	And lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	17	And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall go in after them: and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	18	And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have gotten me honor upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	19	And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud removed from before them, and stood behind them:	2
ASV	Exodus	14	20	and it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night: and the one came not near the other all the night.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	21	And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and Jehovah caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	22	And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	23	And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaohs horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	24	And it came to pass in the morning watch, that Jehovah looked forth upon the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and discomfited the host of the Egyptians.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	25	And he took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for Jehovah fighteth for them against the Egyptians.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	26	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	27	And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and Jehovah overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	28	And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, even all the host of Pharaoh that went in after them into the sea; there remained not so much as one of them.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	29	But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	30	Thus Jehovah saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore.	2
ASV	Exodus	14	31	And Israel saw the great work which Jehovah did upon the Egyptians, and the people feared Jehovah: and they believed in Jehovah, and in his servant Moses.	2
ASV	Exodus	15	1	Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto Jehovah, and spake, saying, I will sing unto Jehovah, for he hath triumphed gloriously: The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.	2
ASV	Exodus	15	2	Jehovah is my strength and song, And he is become my salvation: This is my God, and I will praise him; My fathers God, and I will exalt him.	2
ASV	Exodus	15	3	Jehovah is a man of war: Jehovah is his name.	2
ASV	Exodus	15	4	Pharaohs chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea; And his chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea.	2
ASV	Exodus	15	5	The deeps cover them: They went down into the depths like a stone.	2
ASV	Exodus	15	6	Thy right hand, O Jehovah, is glorious in power, Thy right hand, O Jehovah, dasheth in pieces the enemy.	2
ASV	Exodus	15	7	And in the greatness of thine excellency thou overthrowest them that rise up against thee: Thou sendest forth thy wrath, it consumeth them as stubble.	2
ASV	Exodus	15	8	And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were piled up, The floods stood upright as a heap; The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.	2
ASV	Exodus	15	9	The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; My desire shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.	2
ASV	Exodus	15	10	Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: They sank as lead in the mighty waters.	2
ASV	Exodus	15	11	Who is like unto thee, O Jehovah, among the gods? Who is like thee, glorious in holiness, Fearful in praises, doing wonders?	2
ASV	Exodus	15	12	Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, The earth swallowed them.	2
ASV	Exodus	15	13	Thou in thy lovingkindness hast led the people that thou hast redeemed: Thou hast guided them in thy strength to thy holy habitation.	2
ASV	Exodus	15	14	The peoples have heard, they tremble: Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia.	2
ASV	Exodus	15	15	Then were the chiefs of Edom dismayed; The mighty men of Moab, trembling taketh hold upon them: All the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away.	2
ASV	Exodus	15	16	Terror and dread falleth upon them; By the greatness of thine arm they are as still as a stone; Till thy people pass over, O Jehovah, Till the people pass over that thou hast purchased.	2
ASV	Exodus	15	17	Thou wilt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, The place, O Jehovah, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, The sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established.	2
ASV	Exodus	15	18	Jehovah shall reign for ever and ever.	2
ASV	Exodus	15	19	For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and Jehovah brought back the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea.	2
ASV	Exodus	15	20	And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.	2
ASV	Exodus	15	21	And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to Jehovah, for he hath triumphed gloriously; The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.	2
ASV	Exodus	15	22	And Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.	2
ASV	Exodus	15	23	And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.	2
ASV	Exodus	15	24	And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?	2
ASV	Exodus	15	25	An he cried unto Jehovah; And Jehovah showed him a tree, and he cast it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them;	2
ASV	Exodus	15	26	and he said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his eyes, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon thee, which I have put upon t	2
ASV	Exodus	15	27	And they came to Elim, where were twelve springs of water, and threescore and ten palm-trees: and they encamped there by the waters.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	1	And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	2	And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness:	2
ASV	Exodus	16	3	and the children of Israel said unto them, Would that we had died by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly	2
ASV	Exodus	16	4	Then said Jehovah unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a days portion every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or not.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	5	And it shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	6	And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that Jehovah hath brought you out from the land of Egypt;	2
ASV	Exodus	16	7	and in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of Jehovah; for that he heareth your murmurings against Jehovah: and what are we, that ye murmur against us?	2
ASV	Exodus	16	8	And Moses said, This shall be, when Jehovah shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that Jehovah heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but ag	2
ASV	Exodus	16	9	And Moses said unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before Jehovah; for he hath heard your murmurings.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	10	And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of Jehovah appeared in the cloud.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	11	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	2
ASV	Exodus	16	12	I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	13	And it came to pass at even, that the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the camp.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	14	And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness a small round thing, small as the hoar-frost on the ground.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	15	And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, What is it? For they knew not what it was. And Moses said unto them, It is the bread which Jehovah hath given you to eat.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	16	This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, Gather ye of it every man according to his eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, shall ye take it, every man for them that are in his tent.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	17	And the children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	18	And when they measured it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	19	And Moses said unto them, Let no man leave of it till the morning.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	20	Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul: and Moses was wroth with them.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	21	And they gathered it morning by morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	22	And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	23	And he said unto them, This is that which Jehovah hath spoken, Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy sabbath unto Jehovah: bake that which ye will bake, and boil that which ye will boil; and all that remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	24	And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not become foul, neither was there any worm therein.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	25	And Moses said, Eat that to-day; for to-day is a sabbath unto Jehovah: to-day ye shall not find it in the field.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	26	Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	27	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that there went out some of the people to gather, and they found none.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	28	And Jehovah said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?	2
ASV	Exodus	16	29	See, for that Jehovah hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	30	So the people rested on the seventh day.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	31	And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	32	And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread wherewith I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	33	And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omerful of manna therein, and lay it up before Jehovah, to be kept throughout your generations.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	34	As Jehovah commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	35	And the children of Israel did eat the manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat the manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.	2
ASV	Exodus	16	36	Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.	2
ASV	Exodus	17	1	And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to the commandment of Jehovah, and encamped in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.	2
ASV	Exodus	17	2	Wherefore the people stove with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why strive ye with me? Wherefore do ye tempt Jehovah?	2
ASV	Exodus	17	3	And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore hast thou brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?	2
ASV	Exodus	17	4	And Moses cried unto Jehovah, saying, What shall I do unto this people? They are almost ready to stone me.	2
ASV	Exodus	17	5	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pass on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and they rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thy hand, and go.	2
ASV	Exodus	17	6	Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.	2
ASV	Exodus	17	7	And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the striving of the children of Israel, and because they tempted Jehovah, saying, Is Jehovah among us, or not?	2
ASV	Exodus	17	8	Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.	2
ASV	Exodus	17	9	And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to-morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.	2
ASV	Exodus	17	10	So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.	2
ASV	Exodus	17	11	And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.	2
ASV	Exodus	17	12	But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; And his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.	2
ASV	Exodus	17	13	And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.	2
ASV	Exodus	17	14	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.	2
ASV	Exodus	17	15	And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi;	2
ASV	Exodus	17	16	And he said, Jehovah hath sworn: Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.	2
ASV	Exodus	18	1	Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, how that Jehovah had brought Israel out of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	18	2	And Jethro, Moses father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses wife, after he had sent her away,	2
ASV	Exodus	18	3	and her two sons; of whom the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land:	2
ASV	Exodus	18	4	and the name of the other was Eliezer; for he said, The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.	2
ASV	Exodus	18	5	And Jethro, Moses father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the mount of God:	2
ASV	Exodus	18	6	and he said unto Moses, I, thy father-in-law Jethro, am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.	2
ASV	Exodus	18	7	And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance, and kissed him: and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.	2
ASV	Exodus	18	8	And Moses told his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israels sake, all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how Jehovah delivered them.	2
ASV	Exodus	18	9	And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Jehovah had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.	2
ASV	Exodus	18	10	And Jethro said, Blessed be Jehovah, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.	2
ASV	Exodus	18	11	Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all gods; yea, in the thing wherein they dealt proudly against them.	2
ASV	Exodus	18	12	And Jethro, Moses father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses father-in-law before God.	2
ASV	Exodus	18	13	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood about Moses from the morning unto the evening.	2
ASV	Exodus	18	14	And when Moses father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand about thee from morning unto even?	2
ASV	Exodus	18	15	And Moses said unto his father-in-law, Because the people come unto me to inquire of God:	2
ASV	Exodus	18	16	when they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.	2
ASV	Exodus	18	17	And Moses father-in-law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.	2
ASV	Exodus	18	18	Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for the thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.	2
ASV	Exodus	18	19	Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God be with thee: be thou for the people to God-ward, and bring thou the causes unto God:	2
ASV	Exodus	18	20	and thou shalt teach them the statutes and the laws, and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.	2
ASV	Exodus	18	21	Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:	2
ASV	Exodus	18	22	and let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge themselves: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.	2
ASV	Exodus	18	23	If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people also shall go to their place in peace.	2
ASV	Exodus	18	24	So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.	2
ASV	Exodus	18	25	And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.	2
ASV	Exodus	18	26	And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.	2
ASV	Exodus	18	27	And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land.	2
ASV	Exodus	19	1	In the third month after the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.	2
ASV	Exodus	19	2	And when they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mount.	2
ASV	Exodus	19	3	And Moses went up unto God, and Jehovah called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:	2
ASV	Exodus	19	4	Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles wings, and brought you unto myself.	2
ASV	Exodus	19	5	Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be mine own possession from among all peoples: for all the earth is mine:	2
ASV	Exodus	19	6	and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.	2
ASV	Exodus	19	7	And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Jehovah commanded him.	2
ASV	Exodus	19	8	And all the people answered together, and said, All that Jehovah hath spoken we will do. And Moses reported the words of the people unto Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	19	9	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	19	10	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their garments,	2
ASV	Exodus	19	11	and be ready against the third day; for the third day Jehovah will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.	2
ASV	Exodus	19	12	And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:	2
ASV	Exodus	19	13	no hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, he shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.	2
ASV	Exodus	19	14	And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their garments.	2
ASV	Exodus	19	15	And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not near a woman.	2
ASV	Exodus	19	16	And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp trembled.	2
ASV	Exodus	19	17	And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.	2
ASV	Exodus	19	18	And mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because Jehovah descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.	2
ASV	Exodus	19	19	And when the voice of the trumpet waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.	2
ASV	Exodus	19	20	And Jehovah came down upon mount Sinai, to the top of the mount: and Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.	2
ASV	Exodus	19	21	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto Jehovah to gaze, and many of them perish.	2
ASV	Exodus	19	22	And let the priests also, that come near to Jehovah, sanctify themselves, lest Jehovah break forth upon them.	2
ASV	Exodus	19	23	And Moses said unto Jehovah, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou didst charge us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.	2
ASV	Exodus	19	24	And Jehovah said unto him, Go, get thee down; and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto Jehovah, lest he break forth upon them.	2
ASV	Exodus	19	25	So Moses went down unto the people, and told them.	2
ASV	Exodus	20	1	And God spake all these words, saying,	2
ASV	Exodus	20	2	I am Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.	2
ASV	Exodus	20	3	Thou shalt have no other gods before me.	2
ASV	Exodus	20	4	Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.	2
ASV	Exodus	20	5	Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them, for I Jehovah thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me,	2
ASV	Exodus	20	6	and showing lovingkindness unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.	2
ASV	Exodus	20	7	Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain; for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.	2
ASV	Exodus	20	8	Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.	2
ASV	Exodus	20	9	Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;	2
ASV	Exodus	20	10	but the seventh day is a sabbath unto Jehovah thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:	2
ASV	Exodus	20	11	for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore Jehovah blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.	2
ASV	Exodus	20	12	Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.	2
ASV	Exodus	20	13	Thou shalt not kill.	2
ASV	Exodus	20	14	Thou shalt not commit adultery.	2
ASV	Exodus	20	15	Thou shalt not steal.	2
ASV	Exodus	20	16	Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.	2
ASV	Exodus	20	17	Thou shalt not covet thy neighbors house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbors wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbors.	2
ASV	Exodus	20	18	And all the people perceived the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the voice of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they trembled, and stood afar off.	2
ASV	Exodus	20	19	And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die.	2
ASV	Exodus	20	20	And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before you, that ye sin not.	2
ASV	Exodus	20	21	And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.	2
ASV	Exodus	20	22	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.	2
ASV	Exodus	20	23	Ye shall not make other gods with me; gods of silver, or gods of gold, ye shall not make unto you.	2
ASV	Exodus	20	24	An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in every place where I record my name I will come unto thee and I will bless thee.	2
ASV	Exodus	20	25	And if thou make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones; for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.	2
ASV	Exodus	20	26	Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not uncovered thereon.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	1	Now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	2	If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	3	If he come in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he be married, then his wife shall go out with him.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	4	If his master give him a wife and she bear him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her masters, and he shall go out by himself.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	5	But if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:	2
ASV	Exodus	21	6	then his master shall bring him unto God, and shall bring him to the door, or unto the door-post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	7	And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the men-servants do.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	8	If she please not her master, who hath espoused her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a foreign people he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	9	And if he espouse her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	10	If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	11	And if he do not these three things unto her, then shall she go out for nothing, without money.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	12	He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth, shall surely be put to death.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	13	And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	14	And if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	15	And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	16	And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	17	And he that curseth his father or his mother, shall surely be put to death.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	18	And if men contend, and one smite the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keep his bed;	2
ASV	Exodus	21	19	if he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	20	And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall surely be punished.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	21	Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	22	And if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no harm follow; he shall be surely fined, according as the womans husband shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	23	But if any harm follow, then thou shalt give life for life,	2
ASV	Exodus	21	24	eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,	2
ASV	Exodus	21	25	burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	26	And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, and destroy it; he shall let him go free for his eyes sake.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	27	And if he smite out his man-servants tooth, or his maid-servants tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooths sake.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	28	And if an ox gore a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be surely stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	29	But if the ox was wont to gore in time past, and it hath been testified to its owner, and he hath not kept it in, but it hath killed a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	30	If there be laid on him a ransom, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	31	Whether it have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	32	If the ox gore a man-servant or a maid-servant, there shall be given unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	33	And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein,	2
ASV	Exodus	21	34	the owner of the pit shall make it good; he shall give money unto the owner thereof, and the dead beast shall be his.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	35	And if one mans ox hurt anothers, so that it dieth, then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the price of it: and the dead also they shall divide.	2
ASV	Exodus	21	36	Or if it be known that the ox was wont to gore in time past, and its owner hath not kept it in, he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead beast shall be his own.	2
ASV	Exodus	22	1	If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.	2
ASV	Exodus	22	2	If the thief be found breaking in, and be smitten so that he dieth, there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him.	2
ASV	Exodus	22	3	If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be bloodguiltiness for him; he shall make restitution: if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.	2
ASV	Exodus	22	4	If the theft be found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep, he shall pay double.	2
ASV	Exodus	22	5	If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall let his beast loose, and it feed in another mans field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.	2
ASV	Exodus	22	6	If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the shocks of grain, or the standing grain, or the field are consumed; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.	2

ASV	Exodus	22	9	For every matter of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, whereof one saith, This is it, the cause of both parties shall come before God; he whom God shall condemn shall pay double unto his neigh	2
ASV	Exodus	22	10	If a man deliver unto his neighbor an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:	2
ASV	Exodus	22	11	the oath of Jehovah shall be between them both, whether he hath not put his hand unto his neighbors goods; and the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution.	2

ASV	Exodus	22	22	Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.	2
ASV	Exodus	22	23	If thou afflict them at all, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;	2

ASV	Exodus	22	25	If thou lend money to any of my people with thee that is poor, thou shalt not be to him as a creditor; neither shall ye lay upon him interest.	2
ASV	Exodus	22	26	If thou at all take thy neighbors garment to pledge, thou shalt restore it unto him before the sun goeth down:	2

ASV	Exodus	22	28	Thou shalt not revile God, nor curse a ruler of thy people.	2

ASV	Exodus	23	2	Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to turn aside after a multitude to wrest justice:	2

ASV	Exodus	23	10	And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the increase thereof:	2
ASV	Exodus	23	11	but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beast of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.	2
ASV	Exodus	23	12	Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest; that thine ox and thine ass may have rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the sojourner, may be refreshed.	2
ASV	Exodus	23	13	And in all things that I have said unto you take ye heed: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.	2
ASV	Exodus	23	14	Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.	2
ASV	Exodus	23	15	The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep: seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib (for in it thou camest out from Egypt); and none shall appear before me empty:	2
ASV	Exodus	23	16	and the feast of harvest, the first-fruits of thy labors, which thou sowest in the field: and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year, when thou gatherest in thy labors out of the field.	2
ASV	Exodus	23	17	Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	23	18	Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning.	2
ASV	Exodus	23	19	The first of the first-fruits of thy ground thou shalt bring into the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in it mothers milk.	2
ASV	Exodus	23	20	Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee by the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.	2
ASV	Exodus	23	21	Take ye heed before him, and hearken unto his voice; provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgression: for my name is in him.	2
ASV	Exodus	23	22	But if thou shalt indeed hearken unto his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.	2
ASV	Exodus	23	23	For mine angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: and I will cut them off.	2
ASV	Exodus	23	24	Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works; but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and break in pieces their pillars.	2
ASV	Exodus	23	25	And ye shall serve Jehovah your God, and he will bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.	2
ASV	Exodus	23	26	There shall none cast her young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.	2
ASV	Exodus	23	27	I will send my terror before thee, and will discomfit all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.	2
ASV	Exodus	23	28	And I will send the hornet before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.	2
ASV	Exodus	23	29	I will not drive them out from before thee in one year, lest the land become desolate, and the beasts of the field multiply against thee.	2
ASV	Exodus	23	30	By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.	2
ASV	Exodus	23	31	And I will set thy border from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness unto the River: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand: and thou shalt drive them out before thee.	2
ASV	Exodus	23	32	Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.	2
ASV	Exodus	23	33	They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me; for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.	2
ASV	Exodus	24	1	And he said unto Moses, Come up unto Jehovah, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off:	2
ASV	Exodus	24	2	and Moses alone shall come near unto Jehovah; but they shall not come near; neither shall the people go up with him.	2
ASV	Exodus	24	3	And Moses came and told the people all the words of Jehovah, and all the ordinances: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which Jehovah hath spoken will we do.	2
ASV	Exodus	24	4	And Moses wrote all the words of Jehovah, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the mount, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.	2
ASV	Exodus	24	5	And he sent young men of the children of Israel, who offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings of oxen unto Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	24	6	And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.	2
ASV	Exodus	24	7	And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that Jehovah hath spoken will we do, and be obedient.	2
ASV	Exodus	24	8	And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which Jehovah hath made with you concerning all these words.	2
ASV	Exodus	24	9	Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel.	2
ASV	Exodus	24	10	And they saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of sapphire stone, and as it were the very heaven for clearness.	2
ASV	Exodus	24	11	And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: and they beheld God, and did eat and drink.	2
ASV	Exodus	24	12	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law and the commandment, which I have written, that thou mayest teach them.	2

ASV	Exodus	24	15	And Moses went up into the mount, and the cloud covered the mount.	2
ASV	Exodus	24	16	And the glory of Jehovah abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.	2
ASV	Exodus	24	17	And the appearance of the glory of Jehovah was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.	2
ASV	Exodus	24	18	And Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and went up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.	2
ASV	Exodus	25	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	2
ASV	Exodus	25	2	Speak unto the children of Israel, that they take for me an offering: of every man whose heart maketh him willing ye shall take my offering.	2
ASV	Exodus	25	3	And this is the offering which ye shall take of them: gold, and silver, and brass,	2

ASV	Exodus	28	8	And the skilfully woven band, which is upon it, wherewith to gird it on, shall be like the work thereof and of the same piece; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	9	And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the names of the children of Israel:	2
ASV	Exodus	28	10	six of their names on the one stone, and the names of the six that remain on the other stone, according to their birth.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	11	With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones, according to the names of the children of Israel: thou shalt make them to be inclosed in settings of gold.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	12	And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, to be stones of memorial for the children of Israel: and Aaron shall bear their names before Jehovah upon his two shoulders for a memorial.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	13	And thou shalt make settings of gold,	2
ASV	Exodus	28	14	and two chains of pure gold; like cords shalt thou make them, of wreathen work: and thou shalt put the wreathen chains on the settings.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	15	And thou shalt make a breastplate of judgment, the work of the skilful workman; like the work of the ephod thou shalt make it; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, shalt thou make it.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	16	Foursquare it shall be and double; a span shall be the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	17	And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, four rows of stones: a row of sardius, topaz, and carbuncle shall be the first row;	2
ASV	Exodus	28	18	and the second row an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond;	2
ASV	Exodus	28	19	and the third row a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;	2
ASV	Exodus	28	20	and the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they shall be inclosed in gold in their settings.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	21	And the stones shall be according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet, every one according to his name, they shall be for the twelve tribes.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	22	And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains like cords, of wreathen work of pure gold.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	23	And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold, and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	24	And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings at the ends of the breastplate.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	25	And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt put on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod in the forepart thereof.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	26	And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them upon the two ends of the breastplate, upon the edge thereof, which is toward the side of the ephod inward.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	27	And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and shalt put them on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, in the forepart thereof, close by the coupling thereof, above the skilfully woven band of the ephod.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	28	And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be upon the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate be not loosed from the ephod.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	29	And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy place, for a memorial before Jehovah continually.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	30	And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aarons heart, when he goeth in before Jehovah: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before Jehovah continually.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	31	And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	32	And it shall have a hole for the head in the midst thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as it were the hole of a coat of mail, that it be not rent.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	33	And upon the skirts of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the skirts thereof; and bells of gold between them round about:	2
ASV	Exodus	28	34	a golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe round about.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	35	And it shall be upon Aaron to minister: and the sound thereof shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before Jehovah, and when he cometh out, that he die not.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	36	And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it, like the engravings of a signet, HOLY TO JEHOVAH.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	37	And thou shalt put it on a lace of blue, and it shall be upon the mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	38	And it shall be upon Aarons forehead, and Aaron shall bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	39	And thou shalt weave the coat in checker work of fine linen, and thou shalt make a mitre of fine linen, and thou shalt make a girdle, the work of the embroiderer.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	40	And for Aarons sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt make for them girdles, and head-tires shalt thou make for them, for glory and for beauty.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	41	And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and upon his sons with him, and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priests office.	2
ASV	Exodus	28	42	And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover the flesh of their nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach:	2
ASV	Exodus	28	43	And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they go in unto the tent of meeting, or when they come near unto the altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity, and die: it shall be a statute for ever unto him and unto his seed	2
ASV	Exodus	29	1	And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto me in the priests office: take one young bullock and two rams without blemish,	2
ASV	Exodus	29	2	and unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened mingled with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of fine wheaten flour shalt thou make them.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	3	And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	4	And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tent of meeting, and shalt wash them with water.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	5	And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod;	2
ASV	Exodus	29	6	and thou shalt set the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	7	Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his head, and anoint him.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	8	And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	9	And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and bind head-tires on them: and they shall have the priesthood by a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	10	And thou shalt bring the bullock before the tent of meeting: and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	11	And thou shalt kill the bullock before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	12	And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger; and thou shalt pour out all the blood at the base of the altar.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	13	And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul upon the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	14	But the flesh of the bullock, and its skin, and it dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin-offering.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	15	Thou shalt also take the one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	16	And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take its blood, and sprinkle it round about upon the altar.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	17	And thou shalt cut the ram into its pieces, and wash its inwards, and its legs, and put them with its pieces, and with its head.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	18	And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt-offering unto Jehovah; it is a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	19	And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	20	Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of its blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blo	2
ASV	Exodus	29	21	And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons,	2
ASV	Exodus	29	22	Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat, and the fat tail, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right thigh (for it is a ram of consecration),	2
ASV	Exodus	29	23	and one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, out of the basket of unleavened bread that is before Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	24	And thou shalt put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and shalt wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	25	And thou shalt take them from their hands, and burn them on the altar upon the burnt-offering, for a sweet savor before Jehovah: it is an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	26	And thou shalt take the breast of Aarons ram of consecration, and wave it for a wave-offering before Jehovah: and it shall be thy portion.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	27	And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave-offering, and the thigh of the heave-offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:	2
ASV	Exodus	29	28	and it shall be for Aaron and his sons as their portion for ever from the children of Israel; for it is a heave-offering: and it shall be a heave-offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, even their heave-offering un	2
ASV	Exodus	29	29	And the holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to be anointed in them, and to be consecrated in them.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	30	Seven days shall the son that is priest in his stead put them on, when he cometh into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	31	And thou shalt take the ram of consecration, and boil its flesh in a holy place.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	32	And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, at the door of the tent of meeting.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	33	And they shall eat those things wherewith atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	34	And if aught of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	35	And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	36	And every day shalt thou offer the bullock of sin-offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou makest atonement for it; and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	37	Seven days thou shalt make atonement for the altar, and sanctify it: and the altar shall be most holy; whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	38	Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar: two lambs a year old day by day continually.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	39	The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even:	2
ASV	Exodus	29	40	and with the one lamb a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil, and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink-offering.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	41	And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meal-offering of the morning, and according to the drink-offering thereof, for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	42	It shall be a continual burnt-offering throughout your generations at the door of the tent of meeting before Jehovah, where I will meet with you, to speak there unto thee.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	43	And there I will meet with the children of Israel; and the Tent shall be sanctified by my glory.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	44	And I will sanctify the tent of meeting, and the altar: Aaron also and his sons will I sanctify, to minister to me in the priests office.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	45	And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.	2
ASV	Exodus	29	46	And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell among them: I am Jehovah their God.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	1	And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of acacia wood shalt thou make it.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	2	A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be; and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of one piece with it.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	3	And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	4	And two golden rings shalt thou make for it under the crown thereof; upon the two ribs thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make them; and they shall be for places for staves wherewith to bear it.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	5	And thou shalt make the staves of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	6	And thou shalt put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy-seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	7	And Aaron shall burn thereon incense of sweet spices: every morning, when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn it.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	8	And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before Jehovah throughout your generations.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	9	Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt-offering, nor meal-offering; and ye shall pour no drink-offering thereon.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	10	And Aaron shall make atonement upon the horns of it once in the year; with the blood of the sin-offering of atonement once in the year shall he make atonement for it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	11	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	2
ASV	Exodus	30	12	When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel, according to those that are numbered of them, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto Jehovah, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	13	This they shall give, every one that passeth over unto them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary; (the shekel is twenty gerahs;) half a shekel for an offering to Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	14	Every one that passeth over unto them that are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the offering of Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	15	The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than the half shekel, when they give the offering of Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	16	And thou shalt take the atonement money from the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tent of meeting; that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	17	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	2
ASV	Exodus	30	18	Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and the base thereof of brass, whereat to wash. And thou shalt put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	19	And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:	2
ASV	Exodus	30	20	when they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	21	So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	22	Moreover Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	2
ASV	Exodus	30	23	Take thou also unto thee the chief spices: of flowing myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty,	2
ASV	Exodus	30	24	and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	25	And thou shalt make it a holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer: it shall be a holy anointing oil.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	26	And thou shalt anoint therewith the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony,	2
ASV	Exodus	30	27	and the table and all the vessels thereof, and the candlestick and the vessels thereof, and the altar of incense,	2
ASV	Exodus	30	28	and the altar of burnt-offering with all the vessels thereof, and the laver and the base thereof.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	29	And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	30	And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priests office.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	31	And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be a holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	32	Upon the flesh of man shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any like it, according to the composition thereof: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	33	Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	34	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight;	2
ASV	Exodus	30	35	and thou shalt make of it incense, a perfume after the art of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy:	2
ASV	Exodus	30	36	and thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	37	And the incense which thou shalt make, according to the composition thereof ye shall not make for yourselves: it shall be unto thee holy for Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	30	38	Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereof, he shall be cut off from his people.	2
ASV	Exodus	31	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	2
ASV	Exodus	31	2	See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:	2
ASV	Exodus	31	3	and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,	2
ASV	Exodus	31	4	to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,	2
ASV	Exodus	31	5	and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship.	2
ASV	Exodus	31	6	And I, behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee:	2
ASV	Exodus	31	7	the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the Tent,	2
ASV	Exodus	31	8	and the table and its vessels, and the pure candlestick with all its vessels, and the altar of incense,	2
ASV	Exodus	31	9	and the altar of burnt-offering with all its vessels, and the laver and its base,	2
ASV	Exodus	31	10	and the finely wrought garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priests office,	2
ASV	Exodus	31	11	and the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.	2
ASV	Exodus	31	12	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	2
ASV	Exodus	31	13	Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily ye shall keep my sabbaths: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am Jehovah who sanctifieth you.	2
ASV	Exodus	31	14	Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that profaneth it shall surely be put to death; for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.	2
ASV	Exodus	31	15	Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to Jehovah: whosoever doeth any work on the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.	2
ASV	Exodus	31	16	Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.	2
ASV	Exodus	31	17	It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.	2
ASV	Exodus	31	18	And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, the two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	1	And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of	2
ASV	Exodus	32	2	And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	3	And all the people brake off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	4	And he received it at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, and made it a molten calf: and they said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	5	And when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To-morrow shall be a feast to Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	6	And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt-offerings, and brought peace-offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	7	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, that thou broughtest up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:	2
ASV	Exodus	32	8	they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed unto it, and said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	9	And Jehovah said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:	2
ASV	Exodus	32	10	now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	11	And Moses besought Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, that thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?	2
ASV	Exodus	32	12	Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, saying, For evil did he bring them forth, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	13	Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit i	2
ASV	Exodus	32	14	And Jehovah repented of the evil which he said he would do unto his people.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	15	And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, with the two tables of the testimony in his hand; tables that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	16	And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	17	And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	18	And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome; but the noise of them that sing do I hear.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	19	And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing: and Moses anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	20	And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	21	And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought a great sin upon them?	2
ASV	Exodus	32	22	And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on evil.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	23	For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	24	And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off: so they gave it me; and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	25	And when Moses saw that the people were broken loose, (for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies,)	2
ASV	Exodus	32	26	then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Whoso is on Jehovahs side, let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	27	And he said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	28	And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	29	And Moses said, Consecrate yourselves to-day to Jehovah, yea, every man against his son, and against his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	30	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto Jehovah; peradventure I shall make atonement for your sin.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	31	And Moses returned unto Jehovah, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	32	Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin-; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	33	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	34	And now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine angel shall go before thee; nevertheless in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.	2
ASV	Exodus	32	35	And Jehovah smote the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.	2
ASV	Exodus	33	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Depart, go up hence, thou and the people that thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land of which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:	2
ASV	Exodus	33	2	and I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:	2
ASV	Exodus	33	3	unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee, for thou art a stiffnecked people, lest I consume thee in the way.	2
ASV	Exodus	33	4	And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.	2
ASV	Exodus	33	5	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people; if I go up into the midst of thee for one moment, I shall consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.	2
ASV	Exodus	33	6	And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from mount Horeb onward.	2
ASV	Exodus	33	7	Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it without the camp, afar off from the camp; and he called it, The tent of meeting. And it came to pass, that every one that sought Jehovah went out unto the tent of meeting, which was without the camp.	2
ASV	Exodus	33	8	And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the Tent.	2
ASV	Exodus	33	9	And it came to pass, when Moses entered into the Tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the Tent: and Jehovah spake with Moses.	2
ASV	Exodus	33	10	And all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man at his tent door.	2
ASV	Exodus	33	11	And Jehovah spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the Tent.	2
ASV	Exodus	33	12	And Moses said unto Jehovah, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found favor in my sight.	2
ASV	Exodus	33	13	Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thy sight, show me now thy ways, that I may know thee, to the end that I may find favor in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.	2
ASV	Exodus	33	14	And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.	2
ASV	Exodus	33	15	And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.	2
ASV	Exodus	33	16	For wherein now shall it be known that I have found favor in thy sight, I and thy people? is it not in that thou goest with us, so that we are separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth?	2
ASV	Exodus	33	17	And Jehovah said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken; for thou hast found favor in my sight, and I know thee by name.	2
ASV	Exodus	33	18	And he said, Show me, I pray thee, thy glory.	2
ASV	Exodus	33	19	And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and will proclaim the name of Jehovah before thee; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.	2
ASV	Exodus	33	20	And he said, Thou canst not see my face; for man shall not see me and live.	2
ASV	Exodus	33	21	and Jehovah said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon the rock:	2
ASV	Exodus	33	22	and it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand until I have passed by:	2
ASV	Exodus	33	23	and I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my back; but my face shall not be seen.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	1	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables, which thou brakest.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	2	And be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	3	And no man shall come up with thee; neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	4	And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as Jehovah had commanded him, and took in his hand two tables of stone.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	5	And Jehovah descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	6	And Jehovah passed by before him, and proclaimed, Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness and truth,	2
ASV	Exodus	34	7	keeping lovingkindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin; and that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the childrens children, upon the third and upon the fourth gen	2
ASV	Exodus	34	8	And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	9	And he said, If now I have found favor in thy sight, O Lord, let the Lord, I pray thee, go in the midst of us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	10	And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been wrought in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of Jehovah; for it is a terrible thing that I do	2
ASV	Exodus	34	11	Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	12	Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:	2
ASV	Exodus	34	13	but ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their Asherim;	2
ASV	Exodus	34	14	for thou shalt worship no other god: for Jehovah, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:	2
ASV	Exodus	34	15	lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they play the harlot after their gods, and sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice;	2
ASV	Exodus	34	16	and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters play the harlot after their gods, and make thy sons play the harlot after their gods.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	17	Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	18	The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib; for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	19	All that openeth the womb is mine; and all thy cattle that is male, the firstlings of cow and sheep.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	20	And the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck. All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	21	Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	22	And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, even of the first-fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the years end.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	23	Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord Jehovah, the God of Israel.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	24	For I will cast out nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou goest up to appear before Jehovah thy God three times in the year.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	25	Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	26	The first of the first-fruits of thy ground thou shalt bring unto the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mothers milk.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	27	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	28	And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	29	And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of the testimony in Moses hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	30	And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	31	And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses spake to them.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	32	And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that Jehovah had spoken with him in mount Sinai.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	33	And when Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	34	But when Moses went in before Jehovah to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.	2
ASV	Exodus	34	35	And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses face shone: and Moses put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.	2
ASV	Exodus	35	1	And Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said unto them, These are the words which Jehovah hath commanded, that ye should do them.	2
ASV	Exodus	35	2	Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of solemn rest to Jehovah: whosoever doeth any work therein shall be put to death.	2
ASV	Exodus	35	3	Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.	2
ASV	Exodus	35	4	And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which Jehovah commanded, saying,	2
ASV	Exodus	35	5	Take ye from among you an offering unto Jehovah; whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, Jehovahs offering: gold, and silver, and brass,	2
ASV	Exodus	35	6	and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats hair,	2
ASV	Exodus	35	7	and rams skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia wood,	2
ASV	Exodus	35	8	and oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,	2
ASV	Exodus	35	9	and onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate.	2
ASV	Exodus	35	10	And let every wise-hearted man among you come, and make all that Jehovah hath commanded:	2
ASV	Exodus	35	11	the tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its clasps, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;	2
ASV	Exodus	35	12	the ark, and the staves thereof, the mercy-seat, and the veil of the screen;	2
ASV	Exodus	35	13	the table, and its staves, and all its vessels, and the showbread;	2
ASV	Exodus	35	14	the candlestick also for the light, and its vessels, and its lamps, and the oil for the light;	2
ASV	Exodus	35	15	and the altar of incense, and its staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door, at the door of the tabernacle;	2
ASV	Exodus	35	16	the altar of burnt-offering, with its grating of brass, it staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base;	2
ASV	Exodus	35	17	the hangings of the court, the pillars thereof, and their sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court;	2
ASV	Exodus	35	18	the pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords;	2
ASV	Exodus	35	19	the finely wrought garments, for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priests office.	2
ASV	Exodus	35	20	And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.	2
ASV	Exodus	35	21	And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and brought Jehovahs offering, for the work of the tent of meeting, and for all the service thereof, and for the holy garments.	2
ASV	Exodus	35	22	And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted, and brought brooches, and ear-rings, and signet-rings, and armlets, all jewels of gold; even every man that offered an offering of gold unto Jehovah.	2
ASV	Exodus	35	23	And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats hair, and rams skins dyed red, and sealskins, brought them.	2
ASV	Exodus	35	24	Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought Jehovahs offering; and every man, with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service, brought it.	2
ASV	Exodus	35	25	And all the women that were wise-hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, the blue, and the purple, the scarlet, and the fine linen.	2
ASV	Exodus	35	26	And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats hair.	2
ASV	Exodus	35	27	And the rulers brought the onyx stones, and the stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate;	2
ASV	Exodus	35	28	and the spice, and the oil; for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.	2
ASV	Exodus	35	29	The children of Israel brought a freewill-offering unto Jehovah; every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work, which Jehovah had commanded to be made by Moses.	2
ASV	Exodus	35	30	And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, Jehovah hath called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.	2
ASV	Exodus	35	31	And he hath filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;	2
ASV	Exodus	35	32	and to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,	2
ASV	Exodus	35	33	and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of skilful workmanship.	2
ASV	Exodus	35	34	And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.	2
ASV	Exodus	35	35	Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of workmanship, of the engraver, and of the skilful workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any workmanshi	2
ASV	Exodus	36	1	And Bezalel and Oholiab shall work, and every wise-hearted man, in whom Jehovah hath put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all the work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that Jehovah hath commanded.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	2	And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whose heart Jehovah had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:	2
ASV	Exodus	36	3	and they received of Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, wherewith to make it. And they brought yet unto him freewill-offerings every morning.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	4	And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they wrought.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	5	And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which Jehovah commanded to make.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	6	And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	7	For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	8	And all the wise-hearted men among them that wrought the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, with cherubim, the work of the skilful workman, Bezalel made them.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	9	The length of each curtain was eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits: all the curtains had one measure.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	10	And he coupled five curtains one to another: and the other five curtains he coupled one to another.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	11	And he made loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the second coupling.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	12	Fifty loops made he in the one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling: the loops were opposite one to another.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	13	And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps: so the tabernacle was one.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	14	And he made curtains of goats hair for a tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	15	The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits the breadth of each curtain: the eleven curtains had one measure.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	16	And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	17	And he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which was outmost in the second coupling.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	18	And he made fifty clasps of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	19	And he made a covering for the tent of rams skins dyed red, and a covering of sealskins above.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	20	And he made the boards for the tabernacle, of acacia wood, standing up.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	21	Ten cubits was the length of a board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	22	Each board had two tenons, joined one to another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	23	And he made the boards for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side southward.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	24	And he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	25	And for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards,	2
ASV	Exodus	36	26	and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	27	And for the hinder part of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	28	And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the hinder part.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	29	And they were double beneath; and in like manner they were entire unto the top thereof unto one ring: thus he did to both of them in the two corners.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	30	And there were eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets; under every board two sockets.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	31	And he made bars of acacia wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,	2
ASV	Exodus	36	32	and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the hinder part westward.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	33	And he made the middle bar to pass through in the midst of the boards from the one end to the other.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	34	And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold for places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.	2
ASV	Leviticus	23	18	And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish a year old, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be a burnt-offering unto Jehovah, with their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet sa	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	19	And ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin-offering, and two he-lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace-offerings.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	20	And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits for a wave-offering before Jehovah, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to Jehovah for the priest.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	21	And ye shall make proclamation on the selfsame day; there shall be a holy convocation unto you; ye shall do no servile work: it is a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	22	And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them for the poor, and for the sojourner: I am Jehovah your God.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	23	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	24	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	25	Ye shall do no servile work; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	26	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	27	Howbeit on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement: it shall be a holy convocation unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	28	And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before Jehovah your God.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	29	For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day; he shall be cut off from his people.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	30	And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	31	Ye shall do no manner of work: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	32	It shall be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	33	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	34	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	35	On the first day shall be a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	36	Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: it is a solemn assembly; ye shall do no servile work.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	37	These are the set feasts of Jehovah, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and drink-offerings, each on its own day;	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	38	besides the sabbaths o Jehovah, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill-offerings, which ye give unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	39	Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of Jehovah seven days: on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	40	And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before Jehovah your God seven days.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	41	And ye shall keep it a feast unto Jehovah seven days in the year: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations; ye shall keep it in the seventh month.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	42	Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are home-born in Israel shall dwell in booths;	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	43	that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	44	And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the set feasts of Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	24	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	24	2	Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually.	3
ASV	Leviticus	24	3	Without the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, shall Aaron keep it in order from evening to morning before Jehovah continually: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations.	3
ASV	Leviticus	24	4	He shall keep in order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before Jehovah continually.	3
ASV	Leviticus	24	5	And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth parts of an ephah shall be in one cake.	3
ASV	Leviticus	24	6	And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	24	7	And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	24	8	Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before Jehovah continually; it is on the behalf of the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant.	3
ASV	Leviticus	24	9	And it shall be for Aaron and his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire by a perpetual statute.	3
ASV	Leviticus	24	10	And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp:	3
ASV	Leviticus	24	11	and the son of the Israelitish woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him unto Moses. And his mothers name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.	3
ASV	Leviticus	24	12	And they put him in ward, that it might be declared unto them at the mouth of Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	24	13	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	24	14	Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.	3
ASV	Leviticus	24	15	And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.	3
ASV	Leviticus	24	16	And he that blasphemeth the name of Jehovah, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the sojourner, as the home-born, when he blasphemeth the name of Jehovah, shall be put to death.	3
ASV	Leviticus	24	17	And he that smiteth any man mortally shall surely be put to death.	3
ASV	Leviticus	24	18	And he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good, life for life.	3
ASV	Leviticus	24	19	And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him:	3
ASV	Leviticus	24	20	breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be rendered unto him.	3
ASV	Leviticus	24	21	And he that killeth a beast shall make it good: and he that killeth a man shall be put to death.	3
ASV	Leviticus	24	22	Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the sojourner, as for the home-born: for I am Jehovah your God.	3
ASV	Leviticus	24	23	And Moses spake to the children of Israel; and they brought forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. And the children of Israel did as Jehovah commanded Moses.	3
ASV	Exodus	36	35	And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubim, the work of the skilful workman, made he it.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	36	And he made thereunto four pillars of acacia, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; And he cast for them four sockets of silver.	2
ASV	Exodus	36	37	And he made a screen for the door of the Tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the embroiderer;	2
ASV	Exodus	36	38	and the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their capitals and their fillets with gold; and their five sockets were of brass.	2
ASV	Exodus	37	1	And Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it:	2
ASV	Exodus	37	2	and he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about.	2
ASV	Exodus	37	3	And he cast for it four rings of gold, in the four feet thereof; even two rings on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it.	2
ASV	Exodus	37	4	And he made staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold.	2
ASV	Exodus	37	5	And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.	2
ASV	Exodus	37	6	And he made a mercy-seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half was the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.	2
ASV	Exodus	37	7	And he made two cherubim of gold; of beaten work made he them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat;	2
ASV	Exodus	37	8	one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end: of one piece with the mercy-seat made he the cherubim at the two ends thereof.	2
ASV	Exodus	37	9	And the cherubim spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy-seat with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the mercy-seat were the faces of the cherubim.	2
ASV	Exodus	37	10	And he made the table of acacia wood: two cubits was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof:	2
ASV	Exodus	37	11	and he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereto a crown of gold round about.	2
ASV	Exodus	37	12	And he made unto it a border of a handbreadth round about, and made a golden crown to the border thereof round about.	2
ASV	Exodus	37	13	And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that were on the four feet thereof.	2
ASV	Exodus	37	14	Close by the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table.	2
ASV	Exodus	37	15	And he made the staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table.	2
ASV	Exodus	37	16	And he made the vessels which were upon the table, the dishes thereof, and the spoons thereof, and the bowls thereof, and the flagons thereof, wherewith to pour out, of pure gold.	2
ASV	Exodus	37	17	And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick, even its base, and its shaft; its cups, it knops, and its flowers, were of one piece with it:	2
ASV	Exodus	37	18	and there were six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof:	2
ASV	Exodus	37	19	three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower, and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower: so for the six branches going out of the candlestick.	2
ASV	Exodus	37	20	And in the candlestick were four cups made like almond-blossoms, the knops thereof, and the flowers thereof;	2
ASV	Exodus	37	21	and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of it.	2
ASV	Exodus	37	22	Their knops and their branches were of one piece with it: the whole of it was one beaten work of pure gold.	2
ASV	Exodus	37	23	And he made the lamps thereof, seven, and the snuffers thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, of pure gold.	2
ASV	Exodus	37	24	Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof.	2
ASV	Exodus	37	25	And he made the altar of incense of acacia wood: a cubit was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, foursquare; and two cubits was the height thereof; the horns thereof were of one piece with it.	2
ASV	Exodus	37	26	And he overlaid it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: and he made unto it a crown of gold round about.	2
ASV	Exodus	37	27	And he made for it two golden rings under the crown thereof, upon the two ribs thereof, upon the two sides of it, for places for staves wherewith to bear it.	2
ASV	Exodus	37	28	And he made the staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold.	2
ASV	Exodus	37	29	And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, after the art of the perfumer.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	1	And he made the altar of burnt-offering of acacia wood: five cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof, foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	2	And he made the horns thereof upon the four corners of it; the horns thereof were of one piece with it: and he overlaid it with brass.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	3	And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basins, the flesh-hooks, and the firepans: all the vessels thereof made he of brass.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	4	And he made for the altar a grating of network of brass, under the ledge round it beneath, reaching halfway up.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	5	And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grating of brass, to be places for the staves.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	6	And he made the staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with brass.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	7	And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, wherewith to bear it; he made it hollow with planks.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	8	And he made the laver of brass, and the base thereof of brass, of the mirrors of the ministering women that ministered at the door of the tent of meeting.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	9	And he made the court: for the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, a hundred cubits;	2
ASV	Exodus	38	10	their pillars were twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	11	And for the north side a hundred cubits, their pillars twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	12	And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	13	And for the east side eastward fifty cubits.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	14	The hangings for the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three;	2
ASV	Exodus	38	15	and so for the other side: on this hand and that hand by the gate of the court were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	16	All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	17	And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver; and the overlaying of their capitals, of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	18	And the screen for the gate of the court was the work of the embroiderer, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	19	And their pillars were four, and their sockets four, of brass; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals, and their fillets, of silver.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	20	And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of brass.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	21	This is the sum of the things for the tabernacle, even the tabernacle of the testimony, as they were counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	22	And Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that Jehovah commanded Moses.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	23	And with him was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a skilful workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and in fine linen.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	24	All the gold that was used for the work in all the work of the sanctuary, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	25	And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was a hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:	2
ASV	Exodus	38	26	a beka a head, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that passed over to them that were numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	27	And the hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the veil; a hundred sockets for the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	28	And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their capitals, and made fillets for them.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	29	And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels.	2
ASV	Exodus	38	30	And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tent of meeting, and the brazen altar, and the brazen grating for it, and all the vessels of the altar,	2
ASV	Exodus	38	31	and the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the gate of the court, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	1	And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made finely wrought garments, for ministering in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as Jehovah commanded Moses.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	2	And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	3	And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, the work of the skilful workman.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	4	They made shoulder-pieces for it, joined together; at the two ends was it joined together.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	5	And the skilfully woven band, that was upon it, wherewith to gird it on, was of the same piece and like the work thereof; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as Jehovah commanded Moses.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	6	And they wrought the onyx stones, inclosed in settings of gold, graven with the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the children of Israel.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	7	And he put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, to be stones of memorial for the children of Israel; as Jehovah commanded Moses.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	8	And he made the breastplate, the work of the skilful workman, like the work of the ephod; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	9	It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being double.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	10	And they set in it four rows of stones. A row of sardius, topaz, and carbuncle was the first row;	2
ASV	Exodus	39	11	and the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond;	2
ASV	Exodus	39	12	and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;	2
ASV	Exodus	39	13	and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jaspar: they were inclosed in inclosings of gold in their settings.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	14	And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet, every one according to his name, for the twelve tribes.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	15	And they made upon the breastplate chains like cords, of wreathen work of pure gold.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	16	And they made two settings of gold, and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	17	And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings at the ends of the breastplate.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	18	And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains they put on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, in the forepart thereof.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	19	And they made two rings of gold, and put them upon the two ends of the breastplate, upon the edge thereof, which was toward the side of the ephod inward.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	20	And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, in the forepart thereof, close by the coupling thereof, above the skilfully woven band of the ephod.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	21	And they did bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be upon the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as Jehovah commanded Moses.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	22	And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	23	And the hole of the robe in the midst thereof, as the hole of a coat of mail, with a binding round about the hole of it, that it should not be rent.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	24	And they made upon the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	25	And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the skirts of the robe round about, between the pomegranates;	2
ASV	Exodus	39	26	a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe round about, to minister in; as Jehovah commanded Moses.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	27	And they made the coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,	2
ASV	Exodus	39	28	and the mitre of fine linen, and the goodly head-tires of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twined linen,	2
ASV	Exodus	39	29	and the girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, the work of the embroiderer; as Jehovah commanded Moses.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	30	And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like the engravings of a signet, HOLY TO JEHOVAH.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	31	And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it upon the mitre above; as Jehovah commanded Moses.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	32	Thus was finished all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting: and the children of Israel did according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses; so did they.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	33	And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the Tent, and all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, it bars, and its pillars, and it sockets;	2
ASV	Exodus	39	34	and the covering of rams skins dyed red, and the covering of sealskins, and the veil of the screen;	2
ASV	Exodus	39	35	the ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy-seat;	2
ASV	Exodus	39	36	the table, all the vessels thereof, and the showbread;	2
ASV	Exodus	39	37	the pure candlestick, the lamps thereof, even the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for the light;	2
ASV	Exodus	39	38	and the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door of the Tent;	2
ASV	Exodus	39	39	the brazen altar, and its grating of brass, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base;	2
ASV	Exodus	39	40	the hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court, the cords thereof, and the pins thereof, and all the instruments of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting;	2
ASV	Exodus	39	41	the finely wrought garments for ministering in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priests office.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	42	According to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did all the work.	2
ASV	Exodus	39	43	And Moses saw all the work, and, behold, they had done it; as Jehovah had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	2
ASV	Exodus	40	2	On the first day of the first month shalt thou rear up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	3	And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and thou shalt screen the ark with the veil.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	4	And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	5	And thou shalt set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	6	And thou shalt set the altar of burnt-offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	7	And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and shalt put water therein.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	8	And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	9	And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the furniture thereof: and it shall be holy.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	10	And thou shalt anoint the altar of burnt-offering, and all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and the altar shall be most holy.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	11	And thou shalt anoint the laver and its base, and sanctify it.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	12	And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tent of meeting, and shalt wash them with water.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	13	And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments; and thou shalt anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister unto me in the priests office.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	14	And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them;	2
ASV	Exodus	40	15	and thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priests office: and their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	16	Thus did Moses: according to all that Jehovah commanded him, so did he.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	17	And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	18	And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and laid its sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up its pillars.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	19	And he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as Jehovah commanded Moses.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	20	And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy-seat above upon the ark:	2
ASV	Exodus	40	21	and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony; as Jehovah commanded Moses.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	22	And he put the table in the tent of meeting, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the veil.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	23	And he set the bread in order upon it before Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	24	And he put the candlestick in the tent of meeting, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	25	And he lighted the lamps before Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	26	And he put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil:	2
ASV	Exodus	40	27	and he burnt thereon incense of sweet spices; as Jehovah commanded Moses.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	28	And he put the screen of the door to the tabernacle.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	29	And he set the altar of burnt-offering at the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered upon it the burnt-offering and the meal-offering; as Jehovah commanded Moses.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	30	And he set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water therein, wherewith to wash.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	31	And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat;	2
ASV	Exodus	40	32	when they went into the tent of meeting, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as Jehovah commanded Moses.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	33	And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	34	Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	35	And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	36	And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys:	2
ASV	Exodus	40	37	but if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.	2
ASV	Exodus	40	38	For the cloud of Jehovah was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire therein by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.	2
ASV	Leviticus	1	1	And Jehovah called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tent of meeting, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	1	2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man of you offereth an oblation unto Jehovah, ye shall offer your oblation of the cattle, even of the herd and of the flock.	3
ASV	Leviticus	1	3	If his oblation be a burnt-offering of the herd, he shall offer it a male without blemish: he shall offer it at the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	1	4	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.	3
ASV	Leviticus	1	5	And he shall kill the bullock before Jehovah: and Aarons sons, the priests, shall present the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting.	3
ASV	Leviticus	1	6	And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces.	3
ASV	Leviticus	1	7	And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay wood in order upon the fire;	3
ASV	Leviticus	1	8	and Aarons sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:	3
ASV	Leviticus	1	9	but its inwards and its legs shall he wash with water: and the priest shall burn the whole on the altar, for a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	1	10	And if his oblation be of the flock, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-offering; he shall offer it a male without blemish.	3
ASV	Leviticus	1	11	And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before Jehovah: and Aarons sons, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood upon the altar round about.	3
ASV	Leviticus	1	12	And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat; and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:	3
ASV	Leviticus	1	13	but the inwards and the legs shall he wash with water; and the priest shall offer the whole, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	1	14	And if his oblation to Jehovah be a burnt-offering of birds, then he shall offer his oblation of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons.	3
ASV	Leviticus	1	15	And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off its head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be drained out on the side of the altar;	3
ASV	Leviticus	1	16	and he shall take away its crop with the filth thereof, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes:	3
ASV	Leviticus	1	17	and he shall rend it by the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	2	1	And when any one offereth an oblation of a meal-offering unto Jehovah, his oblation shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon:	3
ASV	Leviticus	2	2	and he shall bring it to Aarons sons the priests; and he shall take thereout his handful of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn it as the memorial thereof upon the altar, an offering	3
ASV	Leviticus	2	3	and that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aarons and his sons: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire.	3
ASV	Leviticus	2	4	And when thou offerest an oblation of a meal-offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.	3
ASV	Leviticus	2	5	And if thy oblation be a meal-offering of the baking-pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.	3
ASV	Leviticus	2	6	Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meal-offering.	3
ASV	Leviticus	2	7	And if thy oblation be a meal-offering of the frying-pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.	3
ASV	Leviticus	2	8	And thou shalt bring the meal-offering that is made of these things unto Jehovah: and it shall be presented unto the priest, and he shall bring it unto the altar.	3
ASV	Leviticus	2	9	And the priest shall take up from the meal-offering the memorial thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	2	10	And that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aarons and his sons: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire.	3
ASV	Leviticus	2	11	No meal-offering, which ye shall offer unto Jehovah, shall be made with leaven; for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, as an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	2	12	As an oblation of first -fruits ye shall offer them unto Jehovah: but they shall not come up for a sweet savor on the altar.	3
ASV	Leviticus	2	13	And every oblation of thy meal-offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meal-offering: with all thine oblations thou shalt offer salt.	3
ASV	Leviticus	2	14	And if thou offer a meal-offering of first-fruits unto Jehovah, thou shalt offer for the meal-offering of thy first-fruits grain in the ear parched with fire, bruised grain of the fresh ear.	3
ASV	Leviticus	2	15	And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meal-offering.	3
ASV	Leviticus	2	16	And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the bruised grain thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	3	1	And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace-offerings; if he offer of the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	3	2	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his oblation, and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting: and Aarons sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.	3
ASV	Leviticus	3	3	And he shall offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,	3
ASV	Leviticus	3	4	and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away.	3
ASV	Leviticus	3	5	And Aarons sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt-offering, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	3	6	And if his oblation for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.	3
ASV	Leviticus	3	7	If he offer a lamb for his oblation, then shall he offer it before Jehovah;	3
ASV	Leviticus	3	8	and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his oblation, and kill it before the tent of meeting: and Aarons sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.	3
ASV	Leviticus	3	9	And he shall offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat thereof, the fat tail entire, he shall take away hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,	3

ASV	Leviticus	3	12	And if his oblation be a goat, then he shall offer it before Jehovah:	3
ASV	Leviticus	3	13	and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tent of meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.	3
ASV	Leviticus	3	14	And he shall offer thereof his oblation, even an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,	3
ASV	Leviticus	3	15	and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away.	3
ASV	Leviticus	3	16	And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire, for a sweet savor; all the fat is Jehovahs.	3
ASV	Leviticus	3	17	It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that ye shall eat neither fat nor blood.	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	2	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any one shall sin unwittingly, in any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and shall do any one of them:	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	3	if the anointed priest shall sin so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto Jehovah for a sin-offering.	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	4	And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tent of meeting before Jehovah; and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the bullock, and kill the bullock before Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	5	And the anointed priest shall take of the blood of the bullock, and bring it to the tent of meeting:	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	6	and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before Jehovah, before the veil of the sanctuary.	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	7	And the priest shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before Jehovah, which is in the tent of meeting; and all the blood of the bullock shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	8	And all the fat of the bullock of the sin-offering he shall take off from it; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	9	and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away,	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	10	as it is taken off from the ox of the sacrifice of peace-offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of burnt-offering.	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	11	And the skin of the bullock, and all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs, and its inwards, and its dung,	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	12	even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall it be burnt.	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	13	And if the whole congregation of Israel err, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and are guilty;	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	14	when the sin wherein they have sinned is known, then the assembly shall offer a young bullock for a sin-offering, and bring it before the tent of meeting.	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	15	And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before Jehovah; and the bullock shall be killed before Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	16	And the anointed priest shall bring of the blood of the bullock to the tent of meeting:	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	17	and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before Jehovah, before the veil.	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	18	And he shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before Jehovah, that is in the tent of meeting; and all the blood shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting.	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	19	And all the fat thereof shall he take off from it, and burn it upon the altar.	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	20	Thus shall he do with the bullock; as he did with the bullock of the sin-offering, so shall he do with this; and the priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven.	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	21	And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bullock: it is the sin-offering for the assembly.	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	22	When a ruler sinneth, and doeth unwittingly any one of all the things which Jehovah his God hath commanded not to be done, and is guilty;	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	23	if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, be made known to him, he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a male without blemish.	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	24	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt-offering before Jehovah: it is a sin-offering.	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	25	And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering.	3

ASV	Leviticus	4	27	And if any one of the common people sin unwittingly, in doing any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and be guilty;	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	28	if his sin, which he hath sinned, be made known to him, then he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned.	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	29	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill the sin-offering in the place of burnt-offering.	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	30	And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar.	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	31	And all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savor unto Jehovah; and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiv	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	32	And if he bring a lamb as his oblation for a sin-offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish.	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	33	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill it for a sin-offering in the place where they kill the burnt-offering.	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	34	And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar:	3
ASV	Leviticus	4	35	and all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall burn them on the altar, upon the offerings of Jehovah made by fire; and the priest shall make atonement for him as	3
ASV	Leviticus	5	1	And if any one sin, in that he heareth the voice of adjuration, he being a witness, whether he hath seen or known, if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity.	3
ASV	Leviticus	5	2	Or if any one touch any unclean thing, whether it be the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and it be hidden from him, and he be unclean, then he shall be guilty.	3
ASV	Leviticus	5	3	Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever his uncleanness be wherewith he is unclean, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.	3
ASV	Leviticus	5	4	Or if any one swear rashly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall utter rashly with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these things.	3
ASV	Leviticus	5	5	And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned:	3
ASV	Leviticus	5	6	and he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin.	3
ASV	Leviticus	5	7	And if his means suffice not for a lamb, then he shall bring his trespass-offering for that wherein he hath sinned, two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, unto Jehovah; one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering.	3
ASV	Leviticus	5	8	And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first, and wring off its head from its neck, but shall not divide it asunder:	3
ASV	Leviticus	5	9	and he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin-offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar: it is a sin-offering.	3
ASV	Leviticus	5	10	And he shall offer the second for a burnt-offering, according to the ordinance; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin which he hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven.	3
ASV	Leviticus	5	11	But if his means suffice not for two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, then he shall bring his oblation for that wherein he hath sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering: he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any f	3
ASV	Leviticus	5	12	And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as the memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, upon the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: it is a sin-offering.	3
ASV	Leviticus	5	13	And the priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in any of these things, and he shall be forgiven: and the remnant shall be the priests, as the meal-offering.	3
ASV	Leviticus	5	14	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	5	15	If any one commit a trespass, and sin unwittingly, in the holy things of Jehovah; then he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation in silver by shekels, after the shekel of the san	3
ASV	Leviticus	5	16	and he shall make restitution for that which he hath done amiss in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering, and he shall be forgiv	3
ASV	Leviticus	5	17	And if any one sin, and do any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done; though he knew it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.	3
ASV	Leviticus	5	18	And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation, for a trespass-offering, unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning the thing wherein he erred unwittingly and knew it not, and he shall b	3
ASV	Leviticus	5	19	It is a trespass-offering: he is certainly guilty before Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	2	If any one sin, and commit a trespass against Jehovah, and deal falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of bargain, or of robbery, or have oppressed his neighbor,	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	3	or have found that which was lost, and deal falsely therein, and swear to a lie; in any of all these things that a man doeth, sinning therein;	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	4	then it shall be, if he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing which he hath gotten by oppression, or the deposit which was committed to him, or the lost thing which he found,	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	5	or any thing about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in full, and shall add the fifth part more thereto: unto him to whom it appertaineth shall he give it, in the day of his being found guilty.	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	6	And he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation, for a trespass-offering, unto the priest:	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	7	and the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah; and he shall be forgiven concerning whatsoever he doeth so as to be guilty thereby.	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	8	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	9	Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt-offering: the burnt-offering shall be on the hearth upon the altar all night unto the morning; and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning thereon.	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	10	And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes whereto the fire hath consumed the burnt-offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	11	And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	12	And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereon, it shall not go out; and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning: and he shall lay the burnt-offering in order upon it, and shall burn thereon the fat of the peace-offerings.	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	13	Fire shall be kept burning upon the altar continually; it shall not go out.	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	14	And this is the law of the meal-offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before Jehovah, before the altar.	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	15	And he shall take up therefrom his handful, of the fine flour of the meal-offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meal-offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savor, as the memorial thereof, unto Jehovah	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	16	And that which is left thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: it shall be eaten without leaven in a holy place; in the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it.	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	17	It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it as their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as the sin-offering, and as the trespass-offering.	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	18	Every male among the children of Aaron shall eat of it, as his portion for ever throughout your generations, from the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: whosoever toucheth them shall be holy.	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	19	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	20	This is the oblation of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto Jehovah in the day when he is anointed: the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half thereof in the evening.	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	21	On a baking-pan it shall be made with oil; when it is soaked, thou shalt bring it in: in baken pieces shalt thou offer the meal-offering for a sweet savor unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	22	And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons shall offer it: by a statute for ever it shall be wholly burnt unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	23	And every meal-offering of the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten.	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	24	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	25	Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin-offering: in the place where the burnt-offering is killed shall the sin-offering be killed before Jehovah: it is most holy.	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	26	The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in a holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting.	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	27	Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy; and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in a holy place.	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	28	But the earthen vessel wherein it is boiled shall be broken; and if it be boiled in a brazen vessel, it shall be scoured, and rinsed in water.	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	29	Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most holy.	3
ASV	Leviticus	6	30	And no sin-offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt with fire.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	1	And this is the law of the trespass-offering: it is most holy.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	2	In the place where they kill the burnt-offering shall they kill the trespass-offering; and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle upon the altar round about.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	3	And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof: the fat tail, and the fat that covereth the inwards,	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	4	and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away;	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	5	and the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: it is a trespass-offering.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	6	Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in a holy place: it is most holy.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	7	As is the sin-offering, so is the trespass-offering; there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith, he shall have it.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	8	And the priest that offereth any mans burnt-offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt-offering which he hath offered.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	9	And every meal-offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the frying-pan, and on the baking-pan, shall be the priests that offereth it.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	10	And every meal-offering, mingled with oil, or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as well as another.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	11	And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which one shall offer unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	12	If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour soaked.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	13	With cakes of leavened bread he shall offer his oblation with the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	14	And of it he shall offer one out of each oblation for a heave-offering unto Jehovah; it shall be the priests that sprinkleth the blood of the peace-offerings.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	15	And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his oblation; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	16	But if the sacrifice of his oblation be a vow, or a freewill-offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offereth his sacrifice; and on the morrow that which remaineth of it shall be eaten:	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	17	but that which remaineth of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	18	And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings be eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	19	And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire. And as for the flesh, every one that is clean shall eat thereof:	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	20	but the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, that pertain unto Jehovah, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	21	And when any one shall touch any unclean thing, the uncleanness of man, or an unclean beast, or any unclean abomination, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which pertain unto Jehovah, that soul shall be cut off from his people.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	22	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	23	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	24	And the fat of that which dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts, may be used for any other service; but ye shall in no wise eat of it.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	25	For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	26	And ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of bird or of beast, in any of your dwellings.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	27	Whosoever it be that eateth any blood, that soul shall be cut off from his people.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	28	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	29	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace-offerings unto Jehovah shall bring his oblation unto Jehovah out of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings:	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	30	his own hands shall bring the offerings of Jehovah made by fire; the fat with the breast shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave-offering before Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	31	And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar; but the breast shall be Aarons and his sons.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	32	And the right thigh shall ye give unto the priest for a heave-offering out of the sacrifices of your peace-offerings.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	33	He among the sons of Aaron that offereth the blood of the peace-offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	34	For the wave-breast and the heave-thigh have I taken of the children of Israel out of the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons as their portion for ever from the children of Israel.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	35	This is the anointing-portion of Aaron, and the anointing-portion of his sons, out of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto Jehovah in the priests office;	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	36	which Jehovah commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them. It is their portion for ever throughout their generations.	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	37	This is the law of the burnt-offering, of the meal-offering, and of the sin-offering, and of the trespass-offering, and of the consecration, and of the sacrifice of peace-offerings;	3
ASV	Leviticus	7	38	which Jehovah commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto Jehovah, in the wilderness of Sinai.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	2	Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bullock of the sin-offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread;	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	3	and assemble thou all the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	4	And Moses did as Jehovah commanded him; and the congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of meeting.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	5	And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded to be done.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	6	And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	7	And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	8	And he placed the breastplate upon him: and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	9	And he set the mitre upon his head; and upon the mitre, in front, did he set the golden plate, the holy crown; as Jehovah commanded Moses.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	10	And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	11	And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the laver and its base, to sanctify them.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	12	And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aarons head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	13	And Moses brought Aarons sons, and clothed them with coats, and girded them with girdles, and bound head-tires upon them; as Jehovah commanded Moses.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	14	And he brought the bullock of the sin-offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock of the sin-offering.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	15	And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement for it.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	16	And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat; and Moses burned it upon the altar.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	17	But the bullock, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as Jehovah commanded Moses.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	18	And he presented the ram of the burnt-offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	19	And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	20	And he cut the ram into its pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	21	And he washed the inwards and the legs with water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt-offering for a sweet savor: it was an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	22	And he presented the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	23	And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood thereof, and put it upon the tip of Aarons right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	24	And he brought Aarons sons; and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	25	And he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right thigh:	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	26	and out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before Jehovah, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat, and upon the right thigh:	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	27	and he put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and waved them for a wave-offering before Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	28	And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt-offering: they were a consecration for a sweet savor: it was an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	29	And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave-offering before Jehovah: it was Moses portion of the ram of consecration; as Jehovah commanded Moses.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	30	And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons garments with him, and sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons garments	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	31	And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting: and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	32	And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	33	And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting seven days, until the days of your consecration be fulfilled: for he shall consecrate you seven days.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	34	As hath been done this day, so Jehovah hath commanded to do, to make atonement for you.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	35	And at the door of the tent of meeting shall ye abide day and night seven days, and keep the charge of Jehovah, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.	3
ASV	Leviticus	8	36	And Aaron and his sons did all the things which Jehovah commanded by Moses.	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	1	And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	2	and he said unto Aaron, Take thee a calf of the herd for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and offer them before Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	3	And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a he-goat for a sin-offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without blemish, for a burnt-offering;	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	4	and an ox and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before Jehovah; and a meal-offering mingled with oil: for to-day Jehovah appeareth unto you.	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	5	And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting: and all the congregation drew near and stood before Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	6	And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah commanded that ye should do: and the glory of Jehovah shall appear unto you.	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	7	And Moses said unto Aaron, Draw near unto the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people; and offer the oblation of the people, and make atonement for them; as Jehovah commanded.	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	8	So Aaron drew near unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself.	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	9	And the sons of Aaron presented the blood unto him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar:	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	10	but the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul from the liver of the sin-offering, he burnt upon the altar; as Jehovah commanded Moses.	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	11	And the flesh and the skin he burnt with fire without the camp.	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	12	And he slew the burnt-offering; and Aarons sons delivered unto him the blood, and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about.	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	13	And they delivered the burnt-offering unto him, piece by piece, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	14	And he washed the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt-offering on the altar.	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	15	And he presented the peoples oblation, and took the goat of the sin-offering which was for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	16	And he presented the burnt-offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	17	And he presented the meal-offering, and filled his hand therefrom, and burnt it upon the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning.	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	18	He slew also the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people: and Aarons sons delivered unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	19	and the fat of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul of the liver:	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	20	and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	21	and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave-offering before Jehovah; as Moses commanded.	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	22	And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings.	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	23	And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of Jehovah appeared unto all the people.	3
ASV	Leviticus	9	24	And there came forth fire from before Jehovah, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat: and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.	3
ASV	Leviticus	10	1	And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer, and put fire therein, and laid incense thereon, and offered strange fire before Jehovah, which he had not commanded them.	3
ASV	Leviticus	10	2	And there came forth fire from before Jehovah, and devoured them, and they died before Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	10	3	Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that Jehovah spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.	3
ASV	Leviticus	10	4	And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Draw near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.	3
ASV	Leviticus	10	5	So they drew near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.	3
ASV	Leviticus	10	6	And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither rend your clothes; that ye die not, and that he be not wroth with all the congregation: but let your brethren, the whole house of Isra	3
ASV	Leviticus	10	7	And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest ye die; for the anointing oil of Jehovah is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.	3
ASV	Leviticus	10	8	And Jehovah spake unto Aaron, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	10	9	Drink no wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tent of meeting, that ye die not: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:	3
ASV	Leviticus	10	10	and that ye may make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean;	3
ASV	Leviticus	10	11	and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Jehovah hath spoken unto them by Moses.	3
ASV	Leviticus	10	12	And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meal-offering that remaineth of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar; for it is most holy;	3
ASV	Leviticus	10	13	and ye shall eat it in a holy place, because it is thy portion, and thy sons portion, of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: for so I am commanded.	3
ASV	Leviticus	10	14	And the wave-breast and the heave-thigh shall ye eat in a clean place, thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they are given as thy portion, and thy sons portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace-offerings of the children of Israel.	3
ASV	Leviticus	10	15	The heave-thigh and the wave-breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave-offering before Jehovah: and it shall be thine, and thy sons with thee, as a portion for ever; as Jehovah hath commanded.	3
ASV	Leviticus	10	16	And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin-offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron that were left, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	10	17	Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin-offering in the place of the sanctuary, seeing it is most holy, and he hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before Jehovah?	3
ASV	Leviticus	10	18	Behold, the blood of it was not brought into the sanctuary within: ye should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.	3
ASV	Leviticus	10	19	And Aaron spake unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering and their burnt-offering before Jehovah; and there have befallen me such things as these: and if I had eaten the sin-offering to-day, would it have been well-pleasing in the	3
ASV	Leviticus	10	20	And when Moses heard that, it was well-pleasing in his sight.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	2	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the living things which ye may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	3	Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that may ye eat.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	4	Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that part the hoof: the camel, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	5	And the coney, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	6	And the hare, because she cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, she is unclean unto you.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	7	And the swine, because he parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, but cheweth not the cud, he is unclean unto you.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	8	Of their flesh ye shall not eat, and their carcasses ye shall not touch; they are unclean unto you.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	9	These may ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, that may ye eat.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	10	And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are an abomination unto you,	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	11	and they shall be an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses ye shall have in abomination.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	12	Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that is an abomination unto you.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	13	And these ye shall have in abomination among the birds; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the gier-eagle, and the ospray,	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	14	and the kite, and the falcon after its kind,	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	15	every raven after its kind,	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	16	and the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the seamew, and the hawk after its kind,	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	17	and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	18	and the horned owl, and the pelican, and the vulture,	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	19	and the stork, the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	20	All winged creeping things that go upon all fours are an abomination unto you.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	21	Yet these may ye eat of all winged creeping things that go upon all fours, which have legs above their feet, wherewith to leap upon the earth.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	22	Even these of them ye may eat: the locust after its kind, and the bald locust after its kind, and the cricket after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	23	But all winged creeping things, which have four feet, are an abomination unto you.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	24	And by these ye shall become unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcass of them shall be unclean until the even;	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	25	And whosoever beareth aught of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	26	Every beast which parteth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, is unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	27	And whatsoever goeth upon its paws, among all beasts that go on all fours, they are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcass shall be unclean until the even.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	28	And he that beareth the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	29	And these are they which are unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard after its kind,	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	30	and the gecko, and the land-crocodile, and the lizard, and the sand-lizard, and the chameleon.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	31	These are they which are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they are dead, shall be unclean until the even.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	32	And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherewith any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean un	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	33	And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean, and it ye shall break.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	34	All food therein which may be eaten, that on which water cometh, shall be unclean; and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	35	And every thing whereupon any part of their carcass falleth shall be unclean; whether oven, or range for pots, it shall be broken in pieces: they are unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	36	Nevertheless a fountain or a pit wherein is a gathering of water shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcass shall be unclean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	37	And if aught of their carcass fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it is clean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	38	But if water be put upon the seed, and aught of their carcass fall thereon, it is unclean unto you.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	39	And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcass thereof shall be unclean until the even.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	40	And he that eateth of the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	41	And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth is an abomination; it shall not be eaten.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	42	Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all fours, or whatsoever hath many feet, even all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	43	Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	44	For I am Jehovah your God: sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that moveth upon the earth.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	45	For I am Jehovah that brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	46	This is the law of the beast, and of the bird, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth;	3
ASV	Leviticus	11	47	to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean, and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten.	3
ASV	Leviticus	12	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	12	2	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman conceive seed, and bear a man-child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of the impurity of her sickness shall she be unclean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	12	3	And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.	3
ASV	Leviticus	12	4	And she shall continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.	3
ASV	Leviticus	12	5	But if she bear a maid-child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her impurity; and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days.	3
ASV	Leviticus	12	6	And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb a year old for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtle-dove, for a sin-offering, unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest:	3
ASV	Leviticus	12	7	and he shall offer it before Jehovah, and make atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood. This is the law for her that beareth, whether a male or a female.	3
ASV	Leviticus	12	8	And if her means suffice not for a lamb, then she shall take two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons; the one for a burnt-offering, and the other for a sin-offering: and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	2	When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it become in the skin of his flesh the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	3	and the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and if the hair in the plague be turned white, and the appearance of the plague be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is the plague of leprosy; and the priest shall look on him, and pron	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	4	And if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white, then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days:	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	5	and the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if in his eyes the plague be at a stay, and the plague be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	6	and the priest shall look on him again the seventh day; and, behold, if the plague be dim, and the plague be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	7	But if the scab spread abroad in the skin, after that he hath showed himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself to the priest again:	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	8	and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the scab be spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is leprosy.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	9	When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	10	and the priest shall look; and, behold, if there be a white rising in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising,	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	11	it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: he shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	12	And if the leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his feet, as far as appeareth to the priest;	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	13	then the priest shall look; and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	14	But whensoever raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	15	And the priest shall look on the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean: the raw flesh is unclean: it is leprosy.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	16	Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, then he shall come unto the priest;	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	17	and the priest shall look on him; and, behold, if the plague be turned into white, then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	18	And when the flesh hath in the skin thereof a boil, and it is healed,	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	19	and in the place of the boil there is a white rising, or a bright spot, reddish-white, then is shall be showed to the priest;	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	20	and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the appearance thereof be lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy, it hath broken out in the boil.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	21	But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and it be not lower than the skin, but be dim; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	22	And if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	23	But if the bright spot stay in its place, and be not spread, it is the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	24	Or when the flesh hath in the skin thereof a burning by fire, and the quick flesh of the burning become a bright spot, reddish-white, or white;	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	25	then the priest shall look upon it; and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin; it is leprosy, it hath broken out in the burning: and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the pl	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	26	But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the skin, but be dim; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	27	and the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	28	And if the bright spot stay in its place, and be not spread in the skin, but be dim; it is the rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is the scar of the burning.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	29	And when a man or woman hath a plague upon the head or upon the beard,	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	30	then the priest shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin, and there be in it yellow thin hair, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a scall, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	31	And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and there be no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days:	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	32	And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the scall be not spread, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the appearance of the scall be not deeper than the skin,	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	33	then he shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	34	and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall; and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	35	But if the scall spread abroad in the skin after his cleansing,	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	36	then the priest shall look on him; and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	37	But if in his eyes the scall be at a stay, and black hair be grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	38	And when a man or a woman hath in the skin of the flesh bright spots, even white bright spots;	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	39	then the priest shall look; and, behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be of a dull white, it is a tetter, it hath broken out in the skin; he is clean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	40	And if a mans hair be fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he clean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	41	And if his hair be fallen off from the front part of his head, he is forehead bald; yet is he clean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	42	But if there be in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white plague; it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	43	Then the priest shall look upon him; and, behold, if the rising of the plague be reddish-white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh;	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	44	he is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall surely pronounce him unclean; his plague is in his head.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	45	And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose, and he shall cover his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	46	All the days wherein the plague is in him he shall be unclean; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his dwelling be.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	47	The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	48	whether it be in warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in anything made of skin;	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	49	if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin; it is the plague of leprosy, and shall be showed unto the priest.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	50	And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up that which hath the plague seven days:	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	51	and he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever service skin is used for; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	52	And he shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in woollen or in linen, or anything of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	53	And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin;	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	54	then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	55	and the priest shall look, after that the plague is washed; and, behold, if the plague have not changed its color, and the plague be not spread, it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire: it is a fret, whether the bareness be within or without.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	56	And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be dim after the washing thereof, then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	57	and if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it is breaking out: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	58	And the garment, either the warp, or the woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	13	59	This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or the woof, or anything of skin, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	2	This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: he shall be brought unto the priest:	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	3	and the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper,	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	4	then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two living clean birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	5	And the priest shall command to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	6	As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water:	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	7	And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let go the living bird into the open field.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	8	And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and bathe himself in water; and he shall be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, but shall dwell outside his tent seven days.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	9	And it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	10	And on the eighth day he shall take two he-lambs without blemish, and one ewe-lamb a year old without blemish, and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	11	And the priest that cleanseth him shall set the man that is to be cleansed, and those things, before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	12	And the priest shall take one of the he-lambs, and offer him for a trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah:	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	13	and he shall kill the he-lamb in the place where they kill the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the place of the sanctuary: for as the sin-offering is the priests, so is the trespass-offering: it is most holy:	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	14	and the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass-offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	15	And the priest shall take of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand;	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	16	and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before Jehovah:	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	17	and of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass-offering:	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	18	and the rest of the oil that is in the priests hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	19	And the priest shall offer the sin-offering, and make atonement for him that is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness: and afterward he shall kill the burnt-offering;	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	20	and the priest shall offer the burnt-offering and the meal-offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	21	And if he be poor, and cannot get so much, then he shall take one he-lamb for a trespass-offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, and one tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering, and a log of oil;	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	22	and two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin-offering, and the other a burnt-offering.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	23	And on the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tent of meeting, before Jehovah:	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	24	and the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	25	And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass-offering; and the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass-offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of h	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	26	And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand;	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	27	and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before Jehovah:	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	28	and the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass-offering:	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	29	and the rest of the oil that is in the priests hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	30	And he shall offer one of the turtle-doves, or of the young pigeons, such as he is able to get,	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	31	even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, with the meal-offering: and the priest shall make atonement for him that is to be cleansed before Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	32	This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, who is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	33	And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	34	When ye are come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	35	then he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, There seemeth to me to be as it were a plague in the house.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	36	And the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest goeth in to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house:	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	37	and he shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and the appearance thereof be lower than the wall;	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	38	then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	39	And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look; and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house;	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	40	then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which the plague is, and cast them into an unclean place without the city:	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	41	and he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the mortar, that they scrape off, without the city into an unclean place:	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	42	and they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	43	And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken out the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plastered;	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	44	then the priest shall come in and look; and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	45	And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	46	Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	47	And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	48	And if the priest shall come in, and look, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plastered; then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	49	And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	50	and he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	51	and he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	52	and he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	53	but he shall let got the living bird out of the city into the open field: so shall he make atonement for the house; and it shall be clean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	54	This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and for a scall,	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	55	and for the leprosy of a garment, and for a house,	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	56	and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot;	3
ASV	Leviticus	14	57	to teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath an issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	3	And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his uncleanness.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	4	Every bed whereon he that hath the issue lieth shall be unclean; and everything whereon he sitteth shall be unclean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	5	And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	6	And he that sitteth on anything whereon he that hath the issue sat shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	7	And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	8	And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean, then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	9	And what saddle soever he that hath the issue rideth upon shall be unclean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	10	And whosoever toucheth anything that was under him shall be unclean until the even: and he that beareth those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	11	And whomsoever he that hath the issue toucheth, without having rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	12	And the earthen vessel, which he that hath the issue toucheth, shall be broken; and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	13	And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue, then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes; and he shall bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	14	And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and come before Jehovah unto the door of the tent of meeting, and give them unto the priest:	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	15	and the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah for his issue.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	16	And if any mans seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall bathe all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	17	And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	18	The woman also with whom a man shall lie with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	19	And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be in her impurity seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	20	And everything that she lieth upon in her impurity shall be unclean: everything also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	21	And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	22	And whosoever toucheth anything that she sitteth upon shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	23	And if it be on the bed, or on anything whereon she sitteth, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	24	And if any man lie with her, and her impurity be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and every bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	25	And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days not in the time of her impurity, or if she have an issue beyond the time of her impurity; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness she shall be as in the days of her impurity: she is unclean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	26	Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her impurity: and everything whereon she sitteth shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her impurity.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	27	And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	28	But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	29	And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	30	And the priest shall offer the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her before Jehovah for the issue of her uncleanness.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	31	Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness, that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that is in the midst of them.	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	32	This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed of copulation goeth from him, so that he is unclean thereby;	3
ASV	Leviticus	15	33	and of her that is sick with her impurity, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before Jehovah, and died;	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	2	and Jehovah said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil, before the mercy-seat which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy-seat.	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	3	Herewith shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering.	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	4	He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with the linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: they are the holy garments; and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and put t	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	5	And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two he-goats for a sin-offering, and one ram for a burnt-offering.	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	6	And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself, and for his house.	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	7	And he shall take the two goats, and set them before Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting.	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	8	And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for Jehovah, and the other lot for Azazel.	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	9	And Aaron shall present the goat upon which the lot fell for Jehovah, and offer him for a sin-offering.	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	10	But the goat, on which the lot fell for Azazel, shall be set alive before Jehovah, to make atonement for him, to send him away for Azazel into the wilderness.	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	11	And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and shall make atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin-offering which is for himself:	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	12	and he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before Jehovah, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	13	and he shall put the incense upon the fire before Jehovah, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy-seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not:	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	14	and he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy-seat on the east; and before the mercy-seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	15	Then shall he kill the goat of the sin-offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy-seat, and before the mercy-seat:	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	16	and he shall make atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleannesses of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, even all their sins: and so shall he do for the tent of meeting, that dwelleth with them in the midst of their unc	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	17	And there shall be no man in the tent of meeting when he goeth in to make atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel.	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	18	And he shall go out unto the altar that is before Jehovah, and make atonement for it, and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about.	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	19	And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the children of Israel.	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	20	And when he hath made an end of atoning for the holy place, and the tent of meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat:	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	21	and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins; and he shall put them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him aw	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	22	and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a solitary land: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	23	And Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	24	and he shall bathe his flesh in water in a holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt-offering and the burnt-offering of the people, and make atonement for himself and for the people.	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	25	And the fat of the sin-offering shall he burn upon the altar.	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	26	And he that letteth go the goat for Azazel shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	27	And the bullock of the sin-offering, and the goat of the sin-offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall be carried forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	28	And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	29	And it shall be a statute for ever unto you: in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and shall do no manner of work, the home-born, or the stranger that sojourneth among you:	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	30	for on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins shall ye be clean before Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	31	It is a sabbath of solemn rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; it is a statute for ever.	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	32	And the priest, who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated to be priest in his fathers stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen garments, even the holy garments:	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	33	and he shall make atonement for the holy sanctuary; and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar; and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.	3
ASV	Leviticus	16	34	And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make atonement for the children of Israel because of all their sins once in the year. And he did as Jehovah commanded Moses.	3
ASV	Leviticus	17	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	17	2	Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them: This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	17	3	What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it without the camp,	3
ASV	Leviticus	17	4	and hath not brought it unto the door of the tent of meeting, to offer it as an oblation unto Jehovah before the tabernacle of Jehovah: blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:	3
ASV	Leviticus	17	5	To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field, even that they may bring them unto Jehovah, unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace-offeri	3
ASV	Leviticus	17	6	And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting, and burn the fat for a sweet savor unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	17	7	And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the he-goats, after which they play the harlot. This shall be a statute forever unto them throughout their generations.	3
ASV	Leviticus	17	8	And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that offereth a burnt-offering or sacrifice,	3
ASV	Leviticus	17	9	and bringeth it not unto the door of the tent of meeting, to sacrifice it unto Jehovah; that man shall be cut off from his people.	3
ASV	Leviticus	17	10	And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that eateth any manner of blood, I will set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people.	3
ASV	Leviticus	17	11	For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh atonement by reason of the life.	3
ASV	Leviticus	17	12	Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.	3
ASV	Leviticus	17	13	And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, who taketh in hunting any beast or bird that may be eaten; he shall pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.	3
ASV	Leviticus	17	14	For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh; for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be c	3
ASV	Leviticus	17	15	And every soul that eateth that which dieth of itself, or that which is torn of beasts, whether he be home-born or a sojourner, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.	3
ASV	Leviticus	17	16	But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am Jehovah your God.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	3	After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do; neither shall ye walk in their statutes.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	4	Mine ordinances shall ye do, and my statutes shall ye keep, to walk therein: I am Jehovah your God.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	5	Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and mine ordinances; which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	6	None of you shall approach to any that are near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	7	The nakedness of thy father, even the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	8	The nakedness of thy fathers wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy fathers nakedness.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	9	The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	10	The nakedness of thy sons daughter, or of thy daughters daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own nakedness.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	11	The nakedness of thy fathers wifes daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	12	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy fathers sister: she is thy fathers near kinswoman.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	13	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mothers sister: for she is thy mothers near kinswoman.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	14	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy fathers brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	15	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law: she is thy sons wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	16	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brothers wife: it is thy brothers nakedness.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	17	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; thou shalt not take her sons daughter, or her daughters daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they are near kinswomen: it is wickedness.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	18	And thou shalt not take a wife to her sister, to be a rival to her, to uncover her nakedness, besides the other in her life-time.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	19	And thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	20	And thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbors wife, to defile thyself with her.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	21	And thou shalt not give any of thy seed to make them pass through the fire to Molech; neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	22	Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	23	And thou shalt not lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith; neither shall any woman stand before a beast, to lie down thereto: it is confusion.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	24	Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out from before you;	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	25	And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land vomiteth out her inhabitants.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	26	Ye therefore shall keep my statutes and mine ordinances, and shall not do any of these abominations; neither the home-born, nor the stranger that sojourneth among you;	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	27	(for all these abominations have the men of the land done, that were before you, and the land is defiled);	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	28	that the land vomit not you out also, when ye defile it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	29	For whosoever shall do any of these abominations, even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people.	3
ASV	Leviticus	18	30	Therefore shall ye keep my charge, that ye practise not any of these abominable customs, which were practised before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am Jehovah your God.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	2	Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy; for I Jehovah your God am holy.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	3	Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father; and ye shall keep my sabbaths: I am Jehovah your God.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	4	Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am Jehovah your God.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	5	And when ye offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah, ye shall offer it that ye may be accepted.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	6	It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if aught remain until the third day, it shall be burnt with fire.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	7	And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination; it shall not be accepted:	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	8	but every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the holy thing of Jehovah: and that soul shall be cut off from his people.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	9	And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	10	And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather the fallen fruit of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and for the sojourner: I am Jehovah your God.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	11	Ye shall not steal; neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	12	And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, and profane the name of thy God: I am Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	13	Thou shalt not oppress thy neighbor, nor rob him: the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	14	Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind; but thou shalt fear thy God: I am Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	15	Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty; but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	16	Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor: I am Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	17	Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart: thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbor, and not bear sin because of him.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	18	Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people; but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: I am Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	19	Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed: neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	20	And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to a husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; they shall be punished; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	21	And he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah, unto the door of the tent of meeting, even a ram for a trespass-offering.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	22	And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering before Jehovah for his sin which he hath sinned: and the sin which he hath sinned shall be forgiven him.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	23	And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as their uncircumcision: three years shall they be as uncircumcised unto you; it shall not be eaten.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	24	But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy, for giving praise unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	25	And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am Jehovah your God.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	26	Ye shall not eat anything with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantments, nor practise augury.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	27	Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	28	Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	29	Profane not thy daughter, to make her a harlot; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	30	Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary; I am Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	31	Turn ye not unto them that have familiar spirits, nor unto the wizards; seek them not out, to be defiled by them: I am Jehovah your God.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	32	Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man, and thou shalt fear thy God: I am Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	33	And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not do him wrong.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	34	The stranger that sojourneth with you shall be unto you as the home-born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	35	Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measures of length, of weight, or of quantity.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	36	Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.	3
ASV	Leviticus	19	37	And ye shall observe all my statutes, and all mine ordinances, and do them: I am Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	2	Moreover, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with st	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	3	I also will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	4	And if the people at the land do at all hide their eyes from that man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and put him not to death;	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	5	then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that play the harlot after him, to play the harlot with Molech, from among their people.	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	6	And the soul that turneth unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto the wizards, to play the harlot after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	7	Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy; for I am Jehovah your God.	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	8	And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am Jehovah who sanctifieth you.	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	9	For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	10	And the man that committeth adultery with another mans wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbors wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	11	And the man that lieth with his fathers wife hath uncovered his fathers nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	12	And if a man lie with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them.	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	13	And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	14	And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	15	And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	16	And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	17	And if a man shall take his sister, his fathers daughter, or his mothers daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a shameful thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people: he hath uncovered his sist	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	18	And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath made naked her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	19	And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mothers sister, nor of thy fathers sister; for he hath made naked his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	20	And if a man shall lie with his uncles wife, he hath uncovered his uncles nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	21	And if a man shall take his brothers wife, it is impurity: he hath uncovered his brothers nakedness; they shall be childless.	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	22	Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all mine ordinances, and do them; that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, vomit you not out.	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	23	And ye shall not walk in the customs of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	24	But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey: I am Jehovah your God, who hath separated you from the peoples.	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	25	Ye shall therefore make a distinction between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by bird, or by anything wherewith the ground teemeth, which I have separate	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	26	And ye shall be holy unto me: for I, Jehovah, am holy, and have set you apart from the peoples, that ye should be mine.	3
ASV	Leviticus	20	27	A man also or a woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones; their blood shall be upon them.	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	1	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none defile himself for the dead among his people;	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	2	except for his kin, that is near unto him, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother,	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	3	and for his sister a virgin, that is near unto him, that hath had no husband; for her may he defile himself.	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	4	He shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	5	They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	6	They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God; for the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	7	They shall not take a woman that is a harlot, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God.	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	8	Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I Jehovah, who sanctify you, am holy.	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	9	And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the harlot, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	10	And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head go loose, nor rend his clothes;	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	11	neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	12	neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	13	And he shall take a wife in her virginity.	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	14	A widow, or one divorced, or a profane woman, a harlot, these shall he not take: but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife.	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	15	And he shall not profane his seed among his people: for I am Jehovah who sanctifieth him.	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	16	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	17	Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed throughout their generations that hath a blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	18	For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or anything superfluous,	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	19	or a man that is broken-footed, or broken-handed,	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	20	or crook-backed, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or is scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	21	no man of the seed of Aaron the priest, that hath a blemish, shall come nigh to offer the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	22	He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy:	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	23	only he shall not go in unto the veil, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them.	3
ASV	Leviticus	21	24	So Moses spake unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	2	Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, which they hallow unto me, and that they profane not my holy name: I am Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	3	Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed throughout your generations, that approacheth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto Jehovah, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from before me: I am Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	4	What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath an issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth anything that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	5	or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	6	the soul that toucheth any such shall be unclean until the even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	7	And when the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he shall eat of the holy things, because it is his bread.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	8	That which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts, he shall not eat, to defile himself therewith: I am Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	9	They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it: I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	10	There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priests, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	11	But if a priest buy any soul, the purchase of his money, he shall eat of it; and such as are born in his house, they shall eat of his bread.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	12	And if a priests daughter be married unto a stranger, she shall not eat of the heave-offering of the holy things.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	13	But if a priests daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and be returned unto her fathers house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her fathers bread: but there shall no stranger eat thereof.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	14	And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give unto the priest the holy thing.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	15	And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto Jehovah,	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	16	and so cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt, when they eat their holy things: for I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	17	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	18	Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whosoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners in Israel, that offereth his oblation, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their freewill-offeri	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	19	that ye may be accepted, ye shall offer a male without blemish, of the bullocks, of the sheep, or of the goats.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	20	But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	21	And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah to accomplish a vow, or for a freewill-offering, of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	22	Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto Jehovah, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	23	Either a bullock or a lamb that hath anything superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill-offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	24	That which hath its stones bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut, ye shall not offer unto Jehovah; neither shall ye do thus in your land.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	25	Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them: they shall not be accepted for you.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	26	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	27	When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for the oblation of an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	28	And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	29	And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto Jehovah, ye shall sacrifice it that ye may be accepted.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	30	On the same day it shall be eaten; ye shall leave none of it until the morning: I am Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	31	Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	32	And ye shall not profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am Jehovah who halloweth you,	3
ASV	Leviticus	22	33	who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, The set feasts of Jehovah, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my set feasts.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	3	Six days shall work be done: but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of work: it is a sabbath unto Jehovah in all your dwellings.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	4	These are the set feasts of Jehovah, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	5	In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, is Jehovahs passover.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	6	And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto Jehovah: seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	7	In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	8	But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah seven days: in the seventh day is a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	9	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	10	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest:	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	11	and he shall wave the sheaf before Jehovah, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	12	And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish a year old for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	13	And the meal-offering thereof shall be two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah for a sweet savor; and the drink-offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	14	And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the oblation of your God: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	15	And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave-offering; seven sabbaths shall there be complete:	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	16	even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meal-offering unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	23	17	Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave-loaves of two tenth parts of an ephah: they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baken with leaven, for first-fruits unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	3	Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruits thereof;	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	4	but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath unto Jehovah: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	5	That which groweth of itself of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, and the grapes of thy undressed vine thou shalt not gather: it shall be a year of solemn rest for the land.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	6	And the sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for thee, and for thy servant and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger, who sojourn with thee.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	7	And for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be for food.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	8	And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and there shall be unto thee the days of seven sabbaths of years, even forty and nine years.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	9	Then shalt thou send abroad the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month; in the day of atonement shall ye send abroad the trumpet throughout all your land.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	10	And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	11	A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of the undressed vines.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	12	For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	13	In this year of jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	14	And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbor, or buy of thy neighbors hand, ye shall not wrong one another.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	15	According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy of thy neighbor, and according unto the number of years of the crops he shall sell unto thee.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	16	According to the multitude of the years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of the years thou shalt diminish the price of it; for the number of the crops doth he sell unto thee.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	17	And ye shall not wrong one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I am Jehovah your God.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	18	Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep mine ordinances and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	19	And the land shall yield its fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	20	And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? Behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase;	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	21	then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	22	And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits, the old store; until the ninth year, until its fruits come in, ye shall eat the old store.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	23	And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is mine: for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	24	And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	25	If thy brother be waxed poor, and sell some of his possession, then shall his kinsman that is next unto him come, and shall redeem that which his brother hath sold.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	26	And if a man have no one to redeem it, and he be waxed rich and find sufficient to redeem it;	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	27	then let him reckon the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; and he shall return unto his possession.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	28	But if he be not able to get it back for himself, then that which he hath sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee: and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	29	And if a man sell a dwelling-house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; for a full year shall he have the right of redemption.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	30	And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him that bought it, throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubilee.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	31	But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	32	Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	33	And if one of the Levites redeem, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	34	But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	35	And if thy brother be waxed poor, and his hand fail with thee; then thou shalt uphold him: as a stranger and a sojourner shall he live with thee.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	36	Take thou no interest of him or increase, but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	37	Thou shalt not give him thy money upon interest, nor give him thy victuals for increase.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	38	I am Jehovah your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	39	And if thy brother be waxed poor with thee, and sell himself unto thee; thou shalt not make him to serve as a bond-servant.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	40	As a hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee; he shall serve with thee unto the year of jubilee:	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	41	then shall he go out from thee, he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	42	For they are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	43	Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor, but shalt fear thy God.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	44	And as for thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, whom thou shalt have; of the nations that are round about you, of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	45	Moreover of the children of the strangers that sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they have begotten in your land: and they shall be your possession.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	46	And ye shall make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession; of them shall ye take your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel ye shall not rule, one over another, with rigor.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	47	And if a stranger or sojourner with thee be waxed rich, and thy brother be waxed poor beside him, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner with thee, or to the stock of the strangers family;	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	48	after that he is sold he may be redeemed: one of his brethren may redeem him;	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	49	or his uncle, or his uncles son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be waxed rich, he may redeem himself.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	50	And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he sold himself to him unto the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years; according to the time of a hired servant shall he be with him.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	51	If there be yet many years, according unto them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	52	And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according unto his years shall he give back the price of his redemption.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	53	As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him: he shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	54	And if he be not redeemed by these means, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his children with him.	3
ASV	Leviticus	25	55	For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	1	Ye shall make you no idols, neither shall ye rear you up a graven image, or a pillar, neither shall ye place any figured stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am Jehovah your God.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	2	Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	3	If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	4	then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	5	And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time; and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	6	And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	7	And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	8	And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	9	And I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	10	And ye shall eat old store long kept, and ye shall bring forth the old because of the new.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	11	And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	12	And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	13	I am Jehovah your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	14	But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	15	and if ye shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhor mine ordinances, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant;	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	16	I also will do this unto you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away; and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	17	And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be smitten before your enemies: they that hate you shall rule over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	18	And if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	19	And I will break the pride of your power: and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass;	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	20	and your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield its increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	21	And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	22	And I will send the beast of the field among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	23	And if by these things ye will not be reformed unto me, but will walk contrary unto me;	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	24	then will I also walk contrary unto you; and I will smite you, even I, seven times for your sins.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	25	And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered together within your cities: and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	26	When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	27	And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	28	then I will walk contrary unto you in wrath; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	29	And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	30	And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-images, and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols; and my soul shall abhor you.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	31	And I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	32	And I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	33	And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you: and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	34	Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye are in your enemies land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	35	As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	36	And as for them that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one fleeth from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	37	And they shall stumble one upon another, as it were before the sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	38	And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	39	And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	40	And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary unto me,	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	41	I also walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity;	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	42	then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	43	The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its sabbaths, while it lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected mine ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	44	And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Jehovah their God;	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	45	but I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	26	46	These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which Jehovah made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by Moses.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall accomplish a vow, the persons shall be for Jehovah by thy estimation.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	3	And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	4	And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	5	And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	6	And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	7	And if it be from sixty years old and upward; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	8	But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of him that vowed shall the priest value him.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	9	And if it be a beast, whereof men offer an oblation unto Jehovah, all that any man giveth of such unto Jehovah shall be holy.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	10	He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	11	And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer an oblation unto Jehovah, then he shall set the beast before the priest;	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	12	and the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou the priest valuest it, so shall it be.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	13	But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part thereof unto thy estimation.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	14	And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto Jehovah, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	15	And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	16	And if a man shall sanctify unto Jehovah part of the field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the sowing thereof: the sowing of a homer of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	17	If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy estimation it shall stand.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	18	But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain unto the year of jubilee; and an abatement shall be made from thy estimation.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	19	And if he that sanctified the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	20	And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more:	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	21	but the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy unto Jehovah, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priests.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	22	And if he sanctify unto Jehovah a field which he hath bought, which is not of the field of his possession;	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	23	then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation unto the year of jubilee: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	24	In the year of jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongeth.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	25	And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	26	Only the firstling among beasts, which is made a firstling to Jehovah, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or sheep, it is Jehovahs.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	27	And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall ransom it according to thine estimation, and shall add unto it the fifth part thereof: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	28	Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto Jehovah of all that he hath, whether of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	29	No one devoted, that shall be devoted from among men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	30	And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is Jehovahs: it is holy unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	31	And if a man will redeem aught of his tithe, he shall add unto it the fifth part thereof.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	32	And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto Jehovah.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	33	He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.	3
ASV	Leviticus	27	34	These are the commandments, which Jehovah commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.	3
ASV	Numbers	1	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	1	2	Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, by their families, by their fathers houses, according to the number of the names, every male, by their polls;	4
ASV	Numbers	1	3	from twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel, thou and Aaron shall number them by their hosts.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	4	And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of his fathers house.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	5	And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you. Of Reuben: Elizur the son of Shedeur.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	6	Of Simeon: Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	7	Of Judah: Nahshon the son of Amminadab.	4

ASV	Numbers	1	14	Of Gad: Eliasaph the son of Deuel.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	15	Of Naphtali: Ahira the son of Enan.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	16	These are they that were called of the congregation, the princes of the tribes of their fathers; they were the heads of the thousands of Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	17	And Moses and Aaron took these men that are mentioned by name:	4
ASV	Numbers	1	18	And they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month; and they declared their pedigrees after their families, by their fathers houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	19	As Jehovah commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	20	And the children of Reuben, Israels first-born, their generations, by their families, by their fathers houses, according to the number of the names, by their polls, every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;	4
ASV	Numbers	1	21	those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Reuben, were forty and six thousand and five hundred.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	22	Of the children of Simeon, their generations, by their families, by their fathers houses, those that were numbered thereof, according to the number of the names, by their polls, every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth t	4
ASV	Numbers	1	23	those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Simeon, were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	24	Of the children of Gad, their generations, by their families, by their fathers houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;	4
ASV	Numbers	1	25	those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Gad, were forty and five thousand six hundred and fifty.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	26	Of the children of Judah, their generations, by their families, by their fathers houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;	4
ASV	Numbers	1	27	those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Judah, were threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	28	Of the children of Issachar, their generations, by their families, by their fathers houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;	4
ASV	Numbers	1	29	those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Issachar, were fifty and four thousand and four hundred.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	30	Of the children of Zebulun, their generations, by their families, by their fathers houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;	4
ASV	Numbers	1	31	those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Zebulun, were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	32	Of the children of Joseph, namely, of the children of Ephraim, their generations, by their families, by their fathers houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;	4
ASV	Numbers	1	33	those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Ephraim, were forty thousand and five hundred.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	34	Of the children of Manasseh, their generations, by their families, by their fathers houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;	4
ASV	Numbers	1	35	those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Manasseh, were thirty and two thousand and two hundred.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	36	Of the children of Benjamin, their generations, by their families, by their fathers houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;	4
ASV	Numbers	1	37	those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Benjamin, were thirty and five thousand and four hundred.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	38	Of the children of Dan, their generations, by their families, by their fathers houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;	4
ASV	Numbers	1	39	those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Dan, were threescore and two thousand and seven hundred.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	40	Of the children of Asher, their generations, by their families, by their fathers houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;	4
ASV	Numbers	1	41	those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Asher, were forty and one thousand and five hundred.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	42	Of the children of Naphtali, their generations, by their families, by their fathers houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;	4
ASV	Numbers	1	43	those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Naphtali, were fifty and three thousand and four hundred.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	44	These are they that were numbered, whom Moses and Aaron numbered, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men: they were each one for his fathers house.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	45	So all they that were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers houses, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel;	4
ASV	Numbers	1	46	even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	47	But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	48	For Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	1	49	Only the tribe of Levi thou shalt not number, neither shalt thou take the sum of them among the children of Israel;	4
ASV	Numbers	1	50	but appoint thou the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all the furniture thereof, and over all that belongeth to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the furniture thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp roun	4
ASV	Numbers	1	51	And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	52	And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, according to their hosts.	4
ASV	Numbers	1	53	But the Levites shall encamp round about the tabernacle of the testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of the testimony.	4

ASV	Numbers	4	19	but thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden;	4
ASV	Numbers	4	20	but they shall not go in to see the sanctuary even for a moment, lest they die.	4
ASV	Numbers	4	21	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4

ASV	Numbers	4	49	According to the commandment of Jehovah they were numbered by Moses, every one according to his service, and according to his burden: thus were they numbered of him, as Jehovah commanded Moses.	4
ASV	Numbers	5	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	5	2	Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is unclean by the dead:	4
ASV	Numbers	5	3	both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camp, in the midst whereof I dwell.	4
ASV	Numbers	5	4	And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp; as Jehovah spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	5	5	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	5	6	Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, so as to trespass against Jehovah, and that soul shall be guilty;	4
ASV	Numbers	5	7	then he shall confess his sin which he hath done: and he shall make restitution for his guilt in full, and add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him in respect of whom he hath been guilty.	4
ASV	Numbers	5	8	But if the man have no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt which is made unto Jehovah shall be the priests; besides the ram of the atonement, whereby atonement shall be made for him.	4
ASV	Numbers	5	9	And every heave-offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they present unto the priest, shall be his.	4
ASV	Numbers	5	10	And every mans hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his.	4
ASV	Numbers	5	11	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	5	12	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any mans wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,	4
ASV	Numbers	5	13	and a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, and she be not taken in the act;	4
ASV	Numbers	5	14	and the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:	4
ASV	Numbers	5	15	then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and shall bring her oblation for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is a meal-offering of jealousy, a meal-offering of memor	4
ASV	Numbers	5	16	And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before Jehovah:	4
ASV	Numbers	5	17	and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water.	4
ASV	Numbers	5	18	And the priest shall set the woman before Jehovah, and let the hair of the womans head go loose, and put the meal-offering of memorial in her hands, which is the meal-offering of jealousy: and the priest shall have in his hand the water of bitterness that	4
ASV	Numbers	5	19	And the priest shall cause her to swear, and shall say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou have not gone aside to uncleanness, being under thy husband, be thou free from this water of bitterness that causeth the curse.	4
ASV	Numbers	5	20	But if thou have gone aside, being under thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee besides thy husband:	4
ASV	Numbers	5	21	then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, Jehovah make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when Jehovah doth make thy thigh to fall away, and thy body to swell;	4
ASV	Numbers	5	22	and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, and make thy body to swell, and thy thigh to fall away. And the woman shall say, Amen, Amen.	4
ASV	Numbers	5	23	And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out into the water of bitterness:	4
ASV	Numbers	5	24	and he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causeth the curse; and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter.	4
ASV	Numbers	5	25	And the priest shall take the meal-offering of jealousy out of the womans hand, and shall wave the meal-offering before Jehovah, and bring it unto the altar:	4
ASV	Numbers	5	26	and the priest shall take a handful of the meal-offering, as the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall make the woman drink the water.	4
ASV	Numbers	5	27	And when he hath made her drink the water, then it shall come to pass, if she be defiled, and have committed a trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter, and her body shall swell, and her th	4
ASV	Numbers	5	28	And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.	4
ASV	Numbers	5	29	This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, being under her husband, goeth aside, and is defiled;	4
ASV	Numbers	5	30	or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon a man, and he is jealous of his wife; then shall he set the woman before Jehovah, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.	4
ASV	Numbers	5	31	And the man shall be free from iniquity, and that woman shall bear her iniquity.	4
ASV	Numbers	6	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	6	2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall make a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself unto Jehovah,	4
ASV	Numbers	6	3	he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried.	4
ASV	Numbers	6	4	All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the grape-vine, from the kernels even to the husk.	4
ASV	Numbers	6	5	All the days of his vow of separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in which he separateth himself unto Jehovah, he shall be holy; he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long.	4
ASV	Numbers	6	6	All the days that he separateth himself unto Jehovah he shall not come near to a dead body.	4
ASV	Numbers	6	7	He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die; because his separation unto God is upon his head.	4
ASV	Numbers	6	8	All the days of his separation he is holy unto Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	6	9	And if any man die very suddenly beside him, and he defile the head of his separation; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.	4
ASV	Numbers	6	10	And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting:	4
ASV	Numbers	6	11	and the priest shall offer one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, and make atonement for him, for that he sinned by reason of the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.	4
ASV	Numbers	6	12	And he shall separate unto Jehovah the days of his separation, and shall bring a he-lamb a year old for a trespass-offering; but the former days shall be void, because his separation was defiled.	4
ASV	Numbers	6	13	And this is the law of the Nazirite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the tent of meeting:	4
ASV	Numbers	6	14	and he shall offer his oblation unto Jehovah, one he-lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering, and one ewe-lamb a year old without blemish for a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish for peace-offerings,	4
ASV	Numbers	6	15	and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings.	4
ASV	Numbers	6	16	And the priest shall present them before Jehovah, and shall offer his sin-offering, and his burnt-offering:	4
ASV	Numbers	6	17	and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof.	4
ASV	Numbers	6	18	And the Nazirite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tent of meeting, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace-offerings.	4

ASV	Numbers	6	20	and the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah; this is holy for the priest, together with the wave-breast and heave-thigh: and after that the Nazirite may drink wine.	4
ASV	Numbers	6	21	This is the law of the Nazirite who voweth, and of his oblation unto Jehovah for his separation, besides that which he is able to get: according to his vow which he voweth, so he must do after the law of his separation.	4
ASV	Numbers	6	22	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	6	23	Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel: ye shall say unto them,	4
ASV	Numbers	6	24	Jehovah bless thee, and keep thee:	4
ASV	Numbers	6	25	Jehovah make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:	4
ASV	Numbers	6	26	Jehovah lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.	4
ASV	Numbers	6	27	So shall they put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them.	4
ASV	Numbers	7	1	And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it, and all the furniture thereof, and the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them and sanctified them;	4
ASV	Numbers	7	2	that the princes of Israel, the heads of their fathers houses, offered. These were the princes of the tribes, these are they that were over them that were numbered:	4
ASV	Numbers	7	3	and they brought their oblation before Jehovah, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for every two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they presented them before the tabernacle.	4
ASV	Numbers	7	4	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	7	5	Take it of them, that they may be used in doing the service of the tent of meeting; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to his service.	4
ASV	Numbers	7	6	And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites.	4

ASV	Numbers	8	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	8	2	Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the candlestick.	4
ASV	Numbers	8	3	And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof so as to give light in front of the candlestick, as Jehovah commanded Moses.	4
ASV	Numbers	8	4	And this was the work of the candlestick, beaten work of gold; unto the base thereof, and unto the flowers thereof, it was beaten work: according unto the pattern which Jehovah had showed Moses, so he made the candlestick.	4
ASV	Numbers	8	5	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	8	6	Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.	4
ASV	Numbers	8	7	And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of expiation upon them, and let them cause a razor to pass over all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves.	4
ASV	Numbers	8	8	Then let them take a young bullock, and its meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil; and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin-offering.	4
ASV	Numbers	8	9	And thou shalt present the Levites before the tent of meeting: and thou shalt assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel:	4
ASV	Numbers	8	10	and thou shalt present the Levites before Jehovah. And the children of Israel shall lay their hands upon the Levites:	4
ASV	Numbers	8	11	and Aaron shall offer the Levites before Jehovah for a wave-offering, on the behalf of the children of Israel, that it may be theirs to do the service of Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	8	12	And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and offer thou the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, unto Jehovah, to make atonement for the Levites.	4
ASV	Numbers	8	13	And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for a wave-offering unto Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	8	14	Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine.	4
ASV	Numbers	8	15	And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tent of meeting: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them for a wave-offering.	4
ASV	Numbers	8	16	For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of all that openeth the womb, even the first-born of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.	4
ASV	Numbers	8	17	For all the first-born among the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.	4
ASV	Numbers	8	18	And I have taken the Levites instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	8	19	And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel; that there be no plague among the chil	4
ASV	Numbers	8	20	Thus did Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the Levites: according unto all that Jehovah commanded Moses touching the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them.	4
ASV	Numbers	8	21	And the Levites purified themselves from sin, and they washed their clothes: and Aaron offered them for a wave-offering before Jehovah; and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.	4
ASV	Numbers	8	22	And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron, and before his sons: as Jehovah had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them.	4
ASV	Numbers	8	23	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	8	24	This is that which belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service in the work of the tent of meeting:	4
ASV	Numbers	8	25	and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the work, and shall serve no more,	4
ASV	Numbers	8	26	but shall minister with their brethren in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charges.	4
ASV	Numbers	9	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	9	2	Moreover let the children of Israel keep the passover in its appointed season.	4
ASV	Numbers	9	3	In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in its appointed season: according to all the statutes of it, and according to all the ordinances thereof, shall ye keep it.	4
ASV	Numbers	9	4	And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.	4
ASV	Numbers	9	5	And they kept the passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at even, in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	9	6	And there were certain men, who were unclean by reason of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:	4
ASV	Numbers	9	7	and those men said unto him, We are unclean by reason of the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer the oblation of Jehovah in its appointed season among the children of Israel?	4
ASV	Numbers	9	8	And Moses said unto them, Stay ye, that I may hear what Jehovah will command concerning you.	4
ASV	Numbers	9	9	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	9	10	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be on a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	9	11	In the second month on the fourteenth day at even they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs:	4
ASV	Numbers	9	12	they shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break a bone thereof: according to all the statute of the passover they shall keep it.	4
ASV	Numbers	9	13	But the man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people; because he offered not the oblation of Jehovah in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.	4
ASV	Numbers	9	14	And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto Jehovah; according to the statute of the passover, and according to the ordinance thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one statute, both for the sojourner, and for him that is bo	4
ASV	Numbers	9	15	And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony: and at even it was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning.	4
ASV	Numbers	9	16	So it was alway: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.	4
ASV	Numbers	9	17	And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel encamped.	4
ASV	Numbers	9	18	At the commandment of Jehovah the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of Jehovah they encamped: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they remained encamped.	4
ASV	Numbers	9	19	And when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of Jehovah, and journeyed not.	4
ASV	Numbers	9	20	And sometimes the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of Jehovah they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed.	4
ASV	Numbers	9	21	And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed: or if it continued by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.	4
ASV	Numbers	9	22	Whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, abiding thereon, the children of Israel remained encamped, and journeyed not; but when it was taken up, they journeyed.	4
ASV	Numbers	9	23	At the commandment of Jehovah they encamped, and at the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed: they kept the charge of Jehovah, at the commandment of Jehovah by Moses.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	10	2	Make thee two trumpets of silver; of beaten work shalt thou make them: and thou shalt use them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	3	And when they shall blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves unto thee at the door of the tent of meeting.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	4	And if they blow but one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	5	And when ye blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall take their journey.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	6	And when ye blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	7	But when the assembly is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	8	And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; and they shall be to you for a statute for ever throughout your generations.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	9	And when ye go to war in your land against the adversary that oppresseth you, then ye shall sound an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before Jehovah your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	10	Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God:	4
ASV	Numbers	10	11	And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	12	And the children of Israel set forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	13	And they first took their journey according to the commandment of Jehovah by Moses.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	14	And in the first place the standard of the camp of the children of Judah set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	15	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	16	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	17	And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bare the tabernacle, set forward.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	18	And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.	4

ASV	Numbers	10	20	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	21	And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the others did set up the tabernacle against their coming.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	22	And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	23	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	24	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.	4

ASV	Numbers	10	26	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ochran.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	27	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	28	Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their hosts; and they set forward.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	29	And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses father-in-law, We are journeying unto the place of which Jehovah said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good; for Jehovah hath spoken good concerning Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	30	And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	31	And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou shalt be to us instead of eyes.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	32	And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what good soever Jehovah shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	33	And they set forward from the mount of Jehovah three days journey; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went before them three days journey, to seek out a resting-place for them.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	34	And the cloud of Jehovah was over them by day, when they set forward from the camp.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	35	And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, O Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.	4
ASV	Numbers	10	36	And when it rested, he said, Return, O Jehovah, unto the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	1	And the people were as murmurers, speaking evil in the ears of Jehovah: and when Jehovah heard it, his anger was kindled; and the fire of Jehovah burnt among them, and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	2	And the people cried unto Moses; and Moses prayed unto Jehovah, and the fire abated.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	3	And the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of Jehovah burnt among them.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	4	And the mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?	4
ASV	Numbers	11	5	We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt for nought; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic:	4
ASV	Numbers	11	6	but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all save this manna to look upon.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	7	And the manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	8	The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	9	And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	10	And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	11	And Moses said unto Jehovah, Wherefore hast thou dealt ill with thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?	4
ASV	Numbers	11	12	Have I conceived all this people? have I brought them forth, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father carrieth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?	4
ASV	Numbers	11	13	Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	14	I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	15	And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	16	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with thee.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	17	And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	18	And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore Jehovah will give you flesh, and ye s	4
ASV	Numbers	11	19	Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days,	4
ASV	Numbers	11	20	but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you; because that ye have rejected Jehovah who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?	4
ASV	Numbers	11	21	And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	22	Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?	4
ASV	Numbers	11	23	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Is Jehovahs hand waxed short? now shalt thou see whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	24	And Moses went out, and told the people the words of Jehovah: and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tent.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	25	And Jehovah came down in the cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	26	But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but had not gone out unto the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	27	And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	28	And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	29	And Moses said unto him, Art thou jealous for my sake? would that all Jehovahs people were prophets, that Jehovah would put his Spirit upon them!	4
ASV	Numbers	11	30	And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	31	And there went forth a wind from Jehovah, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a days journey on this side, and a days journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	32	And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	33	While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	34	And the name of that place was called Kibrothhattaavah, because there they buried the people that lusted.	4
ASV	Numbers	11	35	From Kibrothhattaavah the people journeyed unto Hazeroth; and they abode at Hazeroth.	4
ASV	Numbers	12	1	And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman.	4
ASV	Numbers	12	2	And they said, Hath Jehovah indeed spoken only with Moses? hath he not spoken also with us? And Jehovah heard it.	4
ASV	Numbers	12	3	Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men that were upon the face of the earth.	4
ASV	Numbers	12	4	And Jehovah spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting. And they three came out.	4
ASV	Numbers	12	5	And Jehovah came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forth.	4
ASV	Numbers	12	6	And he said, Hear now my words: if there be a prophet among you, I Jehovah will make myself known unto him in a vision, I will speak with him in a dream.	4
ASV	Numbers	12	7	My servant Moses is not so; he is faithful in all my house:	4
ASV	Numbers	12	8	with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even manifestly, and not in dark speeches; and the form of Jehovah shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?	4
ASV	Numbers	12	9	And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against them; and he departed.	4
ASV	Numbers	12	10	And the cloud removed from over the Tent; and, behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.	4
ASV	Numbers	12	11	And Aaron said unto Moses, Oh, my lord, lay not, I pray thee, sin upon us, for that we have done foolishly, and for that we have sinned.	4
ASV	Numbers	12	12	Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mothers womb.	4
ASV	Numbers	12	13	And Moses cried unto Jehovah, saying, Heal her, O God, I beseech thee.	4
ASV	Numbers	12	14	And Jehovah said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut up without the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again.	4
ASV	Numbers	12	15	And Miriam was shut up without the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.	4
ASV	Numbers	12	16	And afterward the people journeyed from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	13	2	Send thou men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a prince among them.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	3	And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of Jehovah: all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	4	And these were their names: Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	5	Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	6	Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	7	Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	8	Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	9	Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	10	Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	11	Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	12	Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	13	Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	14	Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	15	Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	16	These are the names of the men that Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	17	And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way by the South, and go up into the hill-country:	4
ASV	Numbers	13	18	and see the land, what it is; and the people that dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;	4
ASV	Numbers	13	19	and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds;	4
ASV	Numbers	13	20	and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	21	So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	22	And they went up by the South, and came unto Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)	4
ASV	Numbers	13	23	And they came unto the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it upon a staff between two; they brought also of the pomegranates, and of the figs.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	24	That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from thence.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	25	And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	26	And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	27	And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us; and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	28	Howbeit the people that dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	29	Amalek dwelleth in the land of the South: and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the hill-country; and the Canaanite dwelleth by the sea, and along by the side of the Jordan.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	30	And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	31	But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.	4
ASV	Numbers	13	32	And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men	4
ASV	Numbers	13	33	And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	1	And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	2	And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would that we had died in this wilderness!	4
ASV	Numbers	14	3	And wherefore doth Jehovah bring us unto this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be a prey: were it not better for us to return into Egypt?	4
ASV	Numbers	14	4	And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	5	Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	6	And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of them that spied out the land, rent their clothes:	4
ASV	Numbers	14	7	and they spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceeding good land.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	8	If Jehovah delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it unto us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	9	Only rebel not against Jehovah, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is removed from over them, and Jehovah is with us: fear them not.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	10	But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of Jehovah appeared in the tent of meeting unto all the children of Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	11	And Jehovah said unto Moses, How long will this people despise me? and how long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have wrought among them?	4
ASV	Numbers	14	12	I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	13	And Moses said unto Jehovah, Then the Egyptians will hear it; for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;	4
ASV	Numbers	14	14	and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that thou Jehovah art in the midst of this people; for thou Jehovah art seen face to face, and thy cloud standeth over them, and thou goest before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, an	4
ASV	Numbers	14	15	Now if thou shalt kill this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	14	16	Because Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	17	And now, I pray thee, let the power of the Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	14	18	Jehovah is slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression; and that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	19	Pardon, I pray thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy lovingkindness, and according as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	20	And Jehovah said, I have pardoned according to thy word:	4
ASV	Numbers	14	21	but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of Jehovah;	4
ASV	Numbers	14	22	because all those men that have seen my glory, and my signs, which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;	4
ASV	Numbers	14	23	surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that despised me see it:	4
ASV	Numbers	14	24	but my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	25	Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley: to-morrow turn ye, and get you into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	26	And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	14	27	How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, that murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	28	Say unto them, As I live, saith Jehovah, surely as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:	4
ASV	Numbers	14	29	your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, that have murmured against me,	4
ASV	Numbers	14	30	surely ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware that I would make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	31	But your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have rejected.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	32	But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	33	And your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your whoredoms, until your dead bodies be consumed in the wilderness.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	34	After the number of the days in which ye spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my alienation.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	35	I, Jehovah, have spoken, surely this will I do unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	36	And the men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land,	4
ASV	Numbers	14	37	even those men that did bring up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	38	But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men that went to spy out the land.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	39	And Moses told these words unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	40	And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we are here, and will go up unto the place which Jehovah hath promised: for we have sinned.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	41	And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of Jehovah, seeing it shall not prosper?	4
ASV	Numbers	14	42	Go not up, for Jehovah is not among you; that ye be not smitten down before your enemies.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	43	For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned back from following Jehovah, therefore Jehovah will not be with you.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	44	But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.	4
ASV	Numbers	14	45	Then the Amalekite came down, and the Canaanite who dwelt in that mountain, and smote them and beat them down, even unto Hormah.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	15	2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you,	4
ASV	Numbers	15	3	and will make an offering by fire unto Jehovah, a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a freewill-offering, or in your set feasts, to make a sweet savor unto Jehovah, of the herd, or of the flock;	4
ASV	Numbers	15	4	then shall he that offereth his oblation offer unto Jehovah a meal-offering of a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of oil:	4
ASV	Numbers	15	5	and wine for the drink-offering, the fourth part of a hin, shalt thou prepare with the burnt-offering, or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	6	Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meal-offering two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the third part of a hin of oil:	4
ASV	Numbers	15	7	and for the drink-offering thou shalt offer the third part of a hin of wine, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	8	And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt-offering, or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace-offerings unto Jehovah;	4
ASV	Numbers	15	9	then shall he offer with the bullock a meal-offering of three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with half a hin of oil:	4
ASV	Numbers	15	10	and thou shalt offer for the drink-offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	11	Thus shall it be done for each bullock, or for each ram, or for each of the he-lambs, or of the kids.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	12	According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	13	All that are home-born shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	14	And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever may be among you throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah; as ye do, so he shall do.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	15	For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you, a statute for ever throughout your generations: as ye are, so shall the sojourner be before Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	16	One law and one ordinance shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	17	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	15	18	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,	4
ASV	Numbers	15	19	then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up a heave-offering unto Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	20	Of the first of your dough ye shall offer up a cake for a heave-offering: as the heave-offering of the threshing-floor, so shall ye heave it.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	21	Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto Jehovah a heave-offering throughout your generations.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	22	And when ye shall err, and not observe all these commandments, which Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses,	4
ASV	Numbers	15	23	even all that Jehovah hath commanded you by Moses, from the day that Jehovah gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations;	4
ASV	Numbers	15	24	then it shall be, if it be done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt-offering, for a sweet savor unto Jehovah, with the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering th	4
ASV	Numbers	15	25	And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their oblation, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, and their sin-offering before Jehovah, fo	4
ASV	Numbers	15	26	and all the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; for in respect of all the people it was done unwittingly.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	27	And if one person sin unwittingly, then he shall offer a she-goat a year old for a sin-offering.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	28	And the priest shall make atonement for the soul that erreth, when he sinneth unwittingly, before Jehovah, to make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	29	Ye shall have one law for him that doeth aught unwittingly, for him that is home-born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	30	But the soul that doeth aught with a high hand, whether he be home-born or a sojourner, the same blasphemeth Jehovah; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	31	Because he hath despised the word of Jehovah, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	32	And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbath day.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	33	And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	34	And they put him in ward, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	35	And Jehovah said unto Moses, The man shall surely be put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	36	And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him to death with stones; as Jehovah commanded Moses.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	37	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	15	38	Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of each border a cord of blue:	4
ASV	Numbers	15	39	and it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of Jehovah, and do them; and that ye follow not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to play the harlot;	4
ASV	Numbers	15	40	that ye may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.	4
ASV	Numbers	15	41	I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Jehovah your God.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	1	Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:	4
ASV	Numbers	16	2	and they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown;	4
ASV	Numbers	16	3	and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and Jehovah is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the assem	4
ASV	Numbers	16	4	And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:	4
ASV	Numbers	16	5	and he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, In the morning Jehovah will show who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he shall choose will he cause to come near unto him.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	6	This do: take you censers, Korah, and all his company;	4
ASV	Numbers	16	7	and put fire in them, and put incense upon them before Jehovah to-morrow: and it shall be that the man whom Jehovah doth choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	8	And Moses said unto Korah, Hear now, ye sons of Levi:	4
ASV	Numbers	16	9	seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of Jehovah, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them;	4
ASV	Numbers	16	10	and that he hath brought thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee? and seek ye the priesthood also?	4
ASV	Numbers	16	11	Therefore thou and all thy company are gathered together against Jehovah: and Aaron, what is he that ye murmur against him?	4
ASV	Numbers	16	12	And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, We will not come up:	4
ASV	Numbers	16	13	is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but thou must needs make thyself also a prince over us?	4
ASV	Numbers	16	14	Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	15	And Moses was very wroth, and said unto Jehovah, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	16	And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before Jehovah, thou, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow:	4
ASV	Numbers	16	17	and take ye every man his censer, and put incense upon them, and bring ye before Jehovah every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each his censer.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	18	And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	19	And Korah assembled all the congregation against them unto the door of the tent of meeting: and the glory of Jehovah appeared unto all the congregation.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	20	And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	16	21	Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	22	And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?	4
ASV	Numbers	16	23	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	16	24	Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	25	And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	26	And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	27	So they gat them up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little ones.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	28	And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that Jehovah hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	29	If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then Jehovah hath not sent me.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	30	But if Jehovah make a new thing, and the ground open its mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down alive into Sheol; then ye shall understand that these men have despised Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	31	And it came to pass, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them;	4
ASV	Numbers	16	32	and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	33	So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into Sheol: and the earth closed upon them, and they perished from among the assembly.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	34	And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them; for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	35	And fire came forth from Jehovah, and devoured the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	36	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	16	37	Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are holy,	4
ASV	Numbers	16	38	even the censers of these sinners against their own lives; and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before Jehovah; therefore they are holy; and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	39	And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, which they that were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar,	4
ASV	Numbers	16	40	to be a memorial unto the children of Israel, to the end that no stranger, that is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to burn incense before Jehovah; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as Jehovah spake unto him by Moses.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	41	But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	42	And it came to pass, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Jehovah appeared.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	43	And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	44	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	16	45	Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	46	And Moses said unto Aaron, Take they censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and lay incense thereon, and carry it quickly unto the congregation, and make atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from Jehovah; the plague is begun.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	47	And Aaron took as Moses spake, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	48	And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	49	Now they that died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah.	4
ASV	Numbers	16	50	And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tent of meeting: and the plague was stayed.	4
ASV	Numbers	17	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	17	2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of them rods, one for each fathers house, of all their princes according to their fathers houses, twelve rods: write thou every mans name upon his rod.	4
ASV	Numbers	17	3	And thou shalt write Aarons name upon the rod of Levi; for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers houses.	4
ASV	Numbers	17	4	And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.	4
ASV	Numbers	17	5	And it shall come to pass, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you.	4
ASV	Numbers	17	6	And Moses spake unto the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.	4
ASV	Numbers	17	7	And Moses laid up the rods before Jehovah in the tent of the testimony.	4
ASV	Numbers	17	8	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and produced blossoms, and bare ripe almonds.	4
ASV	Numbers	17	9	And Moses brought out all the rods from before Jehovah unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.	4
ASV	Numbers	17	10	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion; that thou mayest make an end of their murmurings against me, that they die not.	4
ASV	Numbers	17	11	Thus did Moses: as Jehovah commanded him, so did he.	4
ASV	Numbers	17	12	And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone.	4
ASV	Numbers	17	13	Every one that cometh near, that cometh near unto the tabernacle of Jehovah, dieth: shall we perish all of us?	4
ASV	Numbers	18	1	And Jehovah said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy fathers house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	2	And thy brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall be before the tent of the testimony.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	3	And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the Tent: only they shall not come nigh unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the altar, that they die not, neither they, nor ye.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	4	And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the Tent: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	5	And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar; that there be wrath no more upon the children of Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	6	And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are a gift, given unto Jehovah, to do the service of the tent of meeting.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	7	And thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within the veil; and ye shall serve: I give you the priesthood as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	8	And Jehovah spake unto Aaron, And I, behold, I have given thee the charge of my heave-offerings, even all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, as a portion for ever.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	9	This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, even every meal-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy	4
ASV	Numbers	18	10	As the most holy things shalt thou eat thereof; every male shall eat thereof: it shall be holy unto thee.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	11	And this is thine: the heave-offering of their gift, even all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel; I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat	4
ASV	Numbers	18	12	All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first-fruits of them which they give unto Jehovah, to thee have I given them.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	13	The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring unto Jehovah, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	14	Everything devoted in Israel shall be thine.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	15	Everything that openeth the womb, of all flesh which they offer unto Jehovah, both of man and beast shall be thine: nevertheless the first-born of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	16	And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is twenty gerahs).	4
ASV	Numbers	18	17	But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor unto Jehova	4
ASV	Numbers	18	18	And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave-breast and as the right thigh, it shall be thine.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	19	All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto Jehovah, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before Jehovah unto thee and to thy seed wit	4
ASV	Numbers	18	20	And Jehovah said unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any portion among them: I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	21	And unto the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	22	And henceforth the children of Israel shall not come nigh the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	23	But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations; and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	24	For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heave-offering unto Jehovah, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	25	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	18	26	Moreover thou shalt speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up a heave-offering of it for Jehovah, a tithe of the tithe.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	27	And your heave-offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the grain of the threshing-floor, and as the fulness of the winepress.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	28	Thus ye also shall offer a heave-offering unto Jehovah of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and thereof ye shall give Jehovahs heave-offering to Aaron the priest.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	29	Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave-offering of Jehovah, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	30	Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye heave the best thereof from it, then it shall be reckoned unto the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine-press.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	31	And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting.	4
ASV	Numbers	18	32	And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best thereof: and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that ye die not.	4
ASV	Numbers	19	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	19	2	This is the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke.	4
ASV	Numbers	19	3	And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:	4
ASV	Numbers	19	4	and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times.	4
ASV	Numbers	19	5	And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:	4
ASV	Numbers	19	6	and the priest shall take cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.	4
ASV	Numbers	19	7	Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even.	4
ASV	Numbers	19	8	And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.	4
ASV	Numbers	19	9	And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place; and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water for impurity: it is a sin-offering.	4
ASV	Numbers	19	10	And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.	4
ASV	Numbers	19	11	He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days:	4
ASV	Numbers	19	12	the same shall purify himself therewith on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.	4
ASV	Numbers	19	13	Whosoever toucheth a dead person, the body of a man that hath died, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of Jehovah; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water for impurity was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean;	4
ASV	Numbers	19	14	This is the law when a man dieth in a tent: every one that cometh into the tent, and every one that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.	4
ASV	Numbers	19	15	And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean.	4
ASV	Numbers	19	16	And whosoever in the open field toucheth one that is slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.	4
ASV	Numbers	19	17	And for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the sin-offering; and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel:	4
ASV	Numbers	19	18	and a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave:	4
ASV	Numbers	19	19	and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify him; and he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even.	4
ASV	Numbers	19	20	But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of Jehovah: the water for impurity hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.	4
ASV	Numbers	19	21	And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them: and he that sprinkleth the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he that toucheth the water for impurity shall be unclean until even.	4
ASV	Numbers	19	22	And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.	4
ASV	Numbers	20	1	And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.	4
ASV	Numbers	20	2	And there was no water for the congregation: and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.	4
ASV	Numbers	20	3	And the people strove with Moses, and spake, saying, Would that we had died when our brethren died before Jehovah!	4
ASV	Numbers	20	4	And why have ye brought the assembly of Jehovah into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our beasts?	4
ASV	Numbers	20	5	And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.	4
ASV	Numbers	20	6	And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tent of meeting, and fell upon their faces: and the glory of Jehovah appeared unto them.	4
ASV	Numbers	20	7	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	20	8	Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock; so thou shalt give the congregation and their c	4
ASV	Numbers	20	9	And Moses took the rod from before Jehovah, as he commanded him.	4
ASV	Numbers	20	10	And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; shall we bring you forth water out of this rock?	4
ASV	Numbers	20	11	And Moses lifted up his hand, and smote the rock with his rod twice: and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their cattle.	4
ASV	Numbers	20	12	And Jehovah said unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed not in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.	4
ASV	Numbers	20	13	These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with Jehovah, and he was sanctified in them.	4
ASV	Numbers	20	14	And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:	4
ASV	Numbers	20	15	how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and our fathers:	4
ASV	Numbers	20	16	and when we cried unto Jehovah, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border.	4
ASV	Numbers	20	17	Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy land: we will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go along the kings highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have pa	4
ASV	Numbers	20	18	And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against thee.	4
ASV	Numbers	20	19	And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go up by the highway; and if we drink of thy water, I and my cattle, then will I give the price thereof: let me only, without doing anything else, pass through on my feet.	4
ASV	Numbers	20	20	And he said, Thou shalt not pass through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.	4
ASV	Numbers	20	21	Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.	4
ASV	Numbers	20	22	And they journeyed from Kadesh: and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came unto mount Hor.	4
ASV	Numbers	20	23	And Jehovah spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	20	24	Aaron shall be gathered unto his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah.	4
ASV	Numbers	20	25	Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor;	4
ASV	Numbers	20	26	and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there.	4
ASV	Numbers	20	27	And Moses did as Jehovah commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.	4
ASV	Numbers	20	28	And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.	4
ASV	Numbers	20	29	And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	1	And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who dwelt in the South, heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim; and he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	2	And Israel vowed a vow unto Jehovah, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	3	And Jehovah hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and the name of the place was called Hormah.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	4	And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	5	And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	6	And Jehovah sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	7	And the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, because we have spoken against Jehovah, and against thee; pray unto Jehovah, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	8	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a standard: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he seeth it, shall live.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	9	And Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it upon the standard: and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked unto the serpent of brass, he lived.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	10	And the children of Israel journeyed, and encamped in Oboth.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	11	And they journeyed from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	12	From thence they journeyed, and encamped in the valley of Zered.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	13	From thence they journeyed, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that cometh out of the border of the Amorites: for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	14	Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of Jehovah, Vaheb in Suphah, And the valleys of the Arnon,	4
ASV	Numbers	21	15	And the slope of the valleys That inclineth toward the dwelling of Ar, And leaneth upon the border of Moab.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	16	And from thence they journeyed to Beer: that is the well whereof Jehovah said unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	17	Then sang Israel this song: Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:	4
ASV	Numbers	21	18	The well, which the princes digged, Which the nobles of the people delved, With the sceptre, and with their staves. And from the wilderness they journeyed to Mattanah;	4
ASV	Numbers	21	19	and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;	4
ASV	Numbers	21	20	and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh down upon the desert.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	21	And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	21	22	Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the kings highway, until we have passed thy border.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	23	And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he fought against Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	24	And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	25	And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the towns thereof.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	26	For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto the Arnon.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	27	Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come ye to Heshbon; Let the city of Sihon be built and established:	4
ASV	Numbers	21	28	For a fire is gone out of Heshbon, A flame from the city of Sihon: It hath devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places of the Arnon.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	29	Woe to thee, Moab! Thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: He hath given his sons as fugitives, And his daughters into captivity, Unto Sihon king of the Amorites.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	30	We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, And we have laid waste even unto Nophah, Which reacheth unto Medeba.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	31	Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	32	And Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took the towns thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	33	And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	34	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.	4
ASV	Numbers	21	35	So they smote him, and his sons and all his people, until there was none left him remaining: and they possessed his land.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	1	And the children of Israel journeyed, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	2	And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	3	And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	4	And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now will this multitude lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	5	And he sent messengers unto Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide o	4
ASV	Numbers	22	6	Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou curs	4
ASV	Numbers	22	7	And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	8	And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as Jehovah shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	9	And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?	4
ASV	Numbers	22	10	And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	22	11	Behold, the people that is come out of Egypt, it covereth the face of the earth: now, come curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	12	And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people; for they are blessed.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	13	And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land; for Jehovah refuseth to give me leave to go with you.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	14	And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	15	And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	16	And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:	4
ASV	Numbers	22	17	for I will promote thee unto very great honor, and whatsoever thou sayest unto me I will do: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	18	And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Jehovah my God, to do less or more.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	19	Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what Jehovah will speak unto me more.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	20	And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men are come to call thee, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak unto thee, that shalt thou do.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	21	And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	22	And Gods anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of Jehovah placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	23	And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	24	Then the angel of Jehovah stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	25	And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah, and she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaams foot against the wall: and he smote her again.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	26	And the angel of Jehovah went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	27	And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah, and she lay down under Balaam: and Balaams anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with his staff.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	28	And Jehovah opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?	4
ASV	Numbers	22	29	And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me, I would there were a sword in my hand, for now I had killed thee.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	30	And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden all thy life long unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? and he said, Nay.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	31	Then Jehovah opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	32	And the angel of Jehovah said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I am come forth for an adversary, because thy way is perverse before me:	4
ASV	Numbers	22	33	and the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three times: unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had even slain thee, and saved her alive.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	34	And Balaam said unto the angel of Jehovah, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	35	And the angel of Jehovah said unto Balaam, Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	36	And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	37	And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honor?	4
ASV	Numbers	22	38	And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to speak anything? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	39	And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kiriath-huzoth.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	40	And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.	4
ASV	Numbers	22	41	And it came to pass in the morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from thence the utmost part of the people.	4
ASV	Numbers	23	1	And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.	4
ASV	Numbers	23	2	And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.	4
ASV	Numbers	23	3	And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go: peradventure Jehovah will come to meet me; and whatsoever he showeth me I will tell thee. And he went to a bare height.	4
ASV	Numbers	23	4	And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.	4
ASV	Numbers	23	5	And Jehovah put a word in Balaams mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.	4
ASV	Numbers	23	6	And he returned unto him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.	4
ASV	Numbers	23	7	And he took up his parable, and said, From Aram hath Balak brought me, The king of Moab from the mountains of the East: Come, curse me Jacob, And come, defy Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	23	8	How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? And how shall I defy, whom Jehovah hath not defied?	4
ASV	Numbers	23	9	For from the top of the rocks I see him, And from the hills I behold him: lo, it is a people that dwelleth alone, And shall not be reckoned among the nations.	4
ASV	Numbers	23	10	Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, And let my last end be like his!	4
ASV	Numbers	23	11	And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.	4
ASV	Numbers	23	12	And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which Jehovah putteth in my mouth?	4
ASV	Numbers	23	13	And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them; thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.	4
ASV	Numbers	23	14	And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.	4
ASV	Numbers	23	15	And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt-offering, while I meet Jehovah yonder.	4
ASV	Numbers	23	16	And Jehovah met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.	4
ASV	Numbers	23	17	And he came to him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath Jehovah spoken?	4
ASV	Numbers	23	18	And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; Hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:	4
ASV	Numbers	23	19	God is not a man, that he should lie, Neither the son of man, that he should repent: Hath he said, and will he not do it? Or hath he spoken, and will he not make it good?	4
ASV	Numbers	23	20	Behold, I have received commandment to bless: And he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it.	4
ASV	Numbers	23	21	He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob; Neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: Jehovah his God is with him, And the shout of a king is among them.	4
ASV	Numbers	23	22	God bringeth them forth out of Egypt; He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox.	4
ASV	Numbers	23	23	Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob; Neither is there any divination with Israel: Now shalt it be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!	4
ASV	Numbers	23	24	Behold, the people riseth up as a lioness, And as a lion doth he lift himself up: He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, And drink the blood of the slain.	4
ASV	Numbers	23	25	And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.	4
ASV	Numbers	23	26	But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that Jehovah speaketh, that I must do?	4
ASV	Numbers	23	27	And Balak said unto Balaam, Come now, I will take thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.	4
ASV	Numbers	23	28	And Balak took Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh down upon the desert.	4
ASV	Numbers	23	29	And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.	4
ASV	Numbers	23	30	And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.	4
ASV	Numbers	24	1	And when Balaam saw that it pleased Jehovah to bless Israel, he went not, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.	4
ASV	Numbers	24	2	And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him.	4
ASV	Numbers	24	3	And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor saith, And the man whose eye was closed saith;	4
ASV	Numbers	24	4	He saith, who heareth the words of God, Who seeth the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open:	4
ASV	Numbers	24	5	How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, Thy tabernacles, O Israel!	4
ASV	Numbers	24	6	As valleys are they spread forth, As gardens by the river-side, As lign-aloes which Jehovah hath planted, As cedar-trees beside the waters.	4
ASV	Numbers	24	7	Water shall flow from his buckets, And his seed shall be in many waters, And his king shall be higher than Agag, And his kingdom shall be exalted.	4
ASV	Numbers	24	8	God bringeth him forth out of Egypt; He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox: He shall eat up the nations his adversaries, And shall break their bones in pieces, And smite them through with his arrows.	4
ASV	Numbers	24	9	He couched, he lay down as a lion, And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up? Blessed be every one that blesseth thee, And cursed be every one that curseth thee.	4
ASV	Numbers	24	10	And Balaks anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together; and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.	4
ASV	Numbers	24	11	Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honor; but, lo, Jehovah hath kept thee back from honor.	4
ASV	Numbers	24	12	And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers that thou sentest unto me, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	24	13	If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Jehovah, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; what Jehovah speaketh, that will I speak?	4
ASV	Numbers	24	14	And now, behold, I go unto my people: come, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.	4
ASV	Numbers	24	15	And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor saith, And the man whose eye was closed saith;	4
ASV	Numbers	24	16	He saith, who heareth the words of God, And knoweth the knowledge of the Most High, Who seeth the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open:	4
ASV	Numbers	24	17	I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not nigh: There shall come forth a star out of Jacob, And a sceptre shall rise out of Israel, And shall smite through the corners of Moab, And break down all the sons of tumult.	4
ASV	Numbers	24	18	And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession, who were his enemies; While Israel doeth valiantly.	4
ASV	Numbers	24	19	And out of Jacob shall one have dominion, And shall destroy the remnant from the city.	4
ASV	Numbers	24	20	And he looked on Amalek, and took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; But his latter end shall come to destruction.	4
ASV	Numbers	24	21	And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwelling-place, And thy nest is set in the rock.	4
ASV	Numbers	24	22	Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted, Until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.	4
ASV	Numbers	24	23	And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this?	4
ASV	Numbers	24	24	But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim, And they shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber; And he also shall come to destruction.	4
ASV	Numbers	24	25	And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.	4
ASV	Numbers	25	1	And Israel abode in Shittim; and the people began to play the harlot with the daughters of Moab:	4
ASV	Numbers	25	2	for they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods; and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.	4
ASV	Numbers	25	3	And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	25	4	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up unto Jehovah before the sun, that the fierce anger of Jehovah may turn away from Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	25	5	And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that have joined themselves unto Baal-peor.	4
ASV	Numbers	25	6	And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting.	4
ASV	Numbers	25	7	And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand;	4
ASV	Numbers	25	8	and he went after the man of Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	25	9	And those that died by the plague were twenty and four thousand.	4
ASV	Numbers	25	10	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	25	11	Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.	4
ASV	Numbers	25	12	Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:	4
ASV	Numbers	25	13	and it shall be unto him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	25	14	Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers house among the Simeonites.	4
ASV	Numbers	25	15	And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head of the people of a fathers house in Midian.	4
ASV	Numbers	25	16	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	25	17	Vex the Midianites, and smite them;	4
ASV	Numbers	25	18	for they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.	4
ASV	Numbers	26	1	And it came to pass after the plague, that Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	26	2	Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers houses, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	26	3	And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	26	4	Take the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward; as Jehovah commanded Moses and the children of Israel, that came forth out of the land of Egypt.	4

ASV	Numbers	26	10	and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died; what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men, and they became a sign.	4

ASV	Numbers	26	50	These are the families of Naphtali according to their families; and they that were numbered of them were forty and five thousand and four hundred.	4
ASV	Numbers	26	51	These are they that were numbered of the children of Israel, six hundred thousand and a thousand seven hundred and thirty.	4
ASV	Numbers	26	52	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	26	53	Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names.	4
ASV	Numbers	26	54	To the more thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance: to every one according to those that were numbered of him shall his inheritance be given.	4
ASV	Numbers	26	55	Notwithstanding, the land shall be divided by lot: according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.	4
ASV	Numbers	26	56	According to the lot shall their inheritance be divided between the more and the fewer.	4
ASV	Numbers	26	57	And these are they that were numbered of the Levites after their families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites; of Merari, the family of the Merarites.	4
ASV	Numbers	26	58	These are the families of Levi: the family of the Libnites, the family of the Hebronites, the family of the Mahlites, the family of the Mushites, the family of the Korahites. And Kohath begat Amram.	4
ASV	Numbers	26	59	And the name of Amrams wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt: and she bare unto Amram Aaron and Moses, and Miriam their sister.	4
ASV	Numbers	26	60	And unto Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.	4
ASV	Numbers	26	61	And Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire before Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	26	62	And they that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand, every male from a month old and upward: for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	26	63	These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.	4
ASV	Numbers	26	64	But among these there was not a man of them that were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.	4
ASV	Numbers	26	65	For Jehovah had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.	4
ASV	Numbers	27	1	Then drew near the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Ti	4
ASV	Numbers	27	2	And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, at the door of the tent of meeting, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	27	3	Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not among the company of them that gathered themselves together against Jehovah in the company of Korah: but he died in his own sin; and he had no sons.	4
ASV	Numbers	27	4	Why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family, because he had no son? Give unto us a possession among the brethren of our father.	4
ASV	Numbers	27	5	And Moses brought their cause before Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	27	6	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	27	7	The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their fathers brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.	4
ASV	Numbers	27	8	And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.	4
ASV	Numbers	27	9	And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren.	4
ASV	Numbers	27	10	And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his fathers brethren.	4
ASV	Numbers	27	11	And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute and ordinance, as Jehovah commanded Moses.	4
ASV	Numbers	27	12	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, and behold the land which I have given unto the children of Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	27	13	And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered;	4
ASV	Numbers	27	14	because ye rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the waters before their eyes. (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)	4
ASV	Numbers	27	15	And Moses spake unto Jehovah, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	27	16	Let Jehovah, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,	4
ASV	Numbers	27	17	who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in; that the congregation of Jehovah be not as sheep which have no shepherd.	4
ASV	Numbers	27	18	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay thy hand upon him;	4
ASV	Numbers	27	19	and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.	4
ASV	Numbers	27	20	And thou shalt put of thine honor upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may obey.	4
ASV	Numbers	27	21	And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before Jehovah: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregat	4
ASV	Numbers	27	22	And Moses did as Jehovah commanded him; and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:	4
ASV	Numbers	27	23	and he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as Jehovah spake by Moses.	4
ASV	Numbers	28	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	28	2	Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My oblation, my food for my offerings made by fire, of a sweet savor unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.	4
ASV	Numbers	28	3	And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto Jehovah: he-lambs a year old without blemish, two day by day, for a continual burnt-offering.	4
ASV	Numbers	28	4	The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even;	4
ASV	Numbers	28	5	and the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil.	4
ASV	Numbers	28	6	It is a continual burnt-offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	28	7	And the drink-offering thereof shall be the fourth part of a hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou pour out a drink-offering of strong drink unto Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	28	8	And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meal-offering of the morning, and as the drink-offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	28	9	And on the sabbath day two he-lambs a year old without blemish, and two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and the drink-offering thereof:	4
ASV	Numbers	28	10	this is the burnt-offering of every sabbath, besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof.	4
ASV	Numbers	28	11	And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt-offering unto Jehovah: two young bullocks, and one ram, seven he-lambs a year old without blemish;	4
ASV	Numbers	28	12	and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for each bullock; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for the one ram;	4
ASV	Numbers	28	13	and a tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering unto every lamb; for a burnt-offering of a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	28	14	And their drink-offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bullock, and the third part of a hin for the ram, and the fourth part of a hin for a lamb: this is the burnt-offering of every month throughout the months of the year.	4
ASV	Numbers	28	15	And one he-goat for a sin-offering unto Jehovah; it shall be offered besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof.	4
ASV	Numbers	28	16	And in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is Jehovahs passover.	4
ASV	Numbers	28	17	And on the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.	4
ASV	Numbers	28	18	In the first day shall be a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work;	4
ASV	Numbers	28	19	but ye shall offer an offering made by fire, a burnt-offering unto Jehovah: two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven he-lambs a year old; they shall be unto you without blemish;	4
ASV	Numbers	28	20	and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil: three tenth parts shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth parts for the ram;	4
ASV	Numbers	28	21	a tenth part shalt thou offer for every lamb of the seven lambs;	4
ASV	Numbers	28	22	and one he-goat for a sin-offering, to make atonement for you.	4
ASV	Numbers	28	23	Ye shall offer these besides the burnt-offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt-offering.	4
ASV	Numbers	28	24	After this manner ye shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah: it shall be offered besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof.	4
ASV	Numbers	28	25	And on the seventh day ye shall have a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.	4
ASV	Numbers	28	26	Also in the day of the first-fruits, when ye offer a new meal-offering unto Jehovah in your feast of weeks, ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work;	4
ASV	Numbers	28	27	but ye shall offer a burnt-offering for a sweet savor unto Jehovah: two young bullocks, one ram, seven he-lambs a year old;	4
ASV	Numbers	28	28	and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for each bullock, two tenth parts for the one ram,	4
ASV	Numbers	28	29	a tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs;	4
ASV	Numbers	28	30	one he-goat, to make atonement for you.	4
ASV	Numbers	28	31	Besides the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, ye shall offer them (they shall be unto you without blemish), and their drink-offerings.	4
ASV	Numbers	29	1	And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work: it is a day of blowing of trumpets unto you.	4
ASV	Numbers	29	2	And ye shall offer a burnt-offering for a sweet savor unto Jehovah: one young bullock, one ram, seven he-lambs a year old without blemish;	4
ASV	Numbers	29	3	and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for the bullock, two tenth parts for the ram,	4
ASV	Numbers	29	4	and one tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs;	4
ASV	Numbers	29	5	and one he-goat for a sin-offering, to make atonement for you;	4
ASV	Numbers	29	6	besides the burnt-offering of the new moon, and the meal-offering thereof, and the continual burnt-offering and the meal-offering thereof, and their drink-offerings, according unto their ordinance, for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	29	7	And on the tenth day of this seventh month ye shall have a holy convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls: ye shall do no manner of work;	4
ASV	Numbers	29	8	but ye shall offer a burnt-offering unto Jehovah for a sweet savor: one young bullock, one ram, seven he-lambs a year old; they shall be unto you without blemish;	4
ASV	Numbers	29	9	and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for the bullock, two tenth parts for the one ram,	4
ASV	Numbers	29	10	a tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs:	4
ASV	Numbers	29	11	one he-goat for a sin-offering; besides the sin-offering of atonement, and the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, and their drink-offerings.	4
ASV	Numbers	29	12	And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work, and ye shall keep a feast unto Jehovah seven days:	4
ASV	Numbers	29	13	and ye shall offer a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah; thirteen young bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old; they shall be without blemish;	4
ASV	Numbers	29	14	and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for every bullock of the thirteen bullocks, two tenth parts for each ram of the two rams,	4
ASV	Numbers	29	15	and a tenth part for every lamb of the fourteen lambs;	4
ASV	Numbers	29	16	and one he-goat for a sin-offering, besides the continual burnt-offering, the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof.	4
ASV	Numbers	29	17	And on the second day ye shall offer twelve young bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old without blemish;	4
ASV	Numbers	29	18	and their meal-offering and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, after the ordinance;	4
ASV	Numbers	29	19	and one he-goat for a sin-offering; besides the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, and their drink-offerings.	4
ASV	Numbers	29	20	And on the third day eleven bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old without blemish;	4
ASV	Numbers	29	21	and their meal-offering and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, after the ordinance;	4
ASV	Numbers	29	22	and one he-goat for a sin-offering; besides the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof.	4
ASV	Numbers	29	23	And on the fourth day ten bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old without blemish;	4
ASV	Numbers	29	24	their meal-offering and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, after the ordinance;	4
ASV	Numbers	29	25	and one he-goat for a sin-offering; besides the continual burnt-offering, the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof.	4
ASV	Numbers	29	26	And on the fifth day nine bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old without blemish;	4
ASV	Numbers	29	27	and their meal-offering and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, after the ordinance;	4
ASV	Numbers	29	28	and one he-goat for a sin-offering, besides the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof.	4
ASV	Numbers	29	29	And on the sixth day eight bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old without blemish;	4
ASV	Numbers	29	30	and their meal-offering and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, after the ordinance;	4
ASV	Numbers	29	31	and one he-goat for a sin-offering; besides the continual burnt-offering, the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offerings thereof.	4
ASV	Numbers	29	32	And on the seventh day seven bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old without blemish;	4
ASV	Numbers	29	33	and their meal-offering and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, after the ordinance;	4
ASV	Numbers	29	34	and one he-goat for a sin-offering; besides the continual burnt-offering, the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof.	4
ASV	Numbers	29	35	On the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly: ye shall do no servile work;	4
ASV	Numbers	29	36	but ye shall offer a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah: one bullock, one ram, seven he-lambs a year old without blemish;	4
ASV	Numbers	29	37	their meal-offering and their drink-offerings for the bullock, for the ram, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the ordinance:	4
ASV	Numbers	29	38	and one he-goat for a sin-offering, besides the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof.	4
ASV	Numbers	29	39	These ye shall offer unto Jehovah in your set feasts, besides your vows, and your freewill-offerings, for your burnt-offerings, and for your meal-offerings, and for your drink-offerings, and for your peace-offerings.	4
ASV	Numbers	29	40	And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses.	4
ASV	Numbers	30	1	And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded.	4
ASV	Numbers	30	2	When a man voweth a vow unto Jehovah, or sweareth an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.	4
ASV	Numbers	30	3	Also when a woman voweth a vow unto Jehovah, and bindeth herself by a bond, being in her fathers house, in her youth,	4
ASV	Numbers	30	4	and her father heareth her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father holdeth his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.	4
ASV	Numbers	30	5	But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth, none of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and Jehovah will forgive her, because her father disallowed her.	4
ASV	Numbers	30	6	And if she be married to a husband, while her vows are upon her, or the rash utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul,	4
ASV	Numbers	30	7	and her husband hear it, and hold his peace at her in the day that he heareth it; then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.	4
ASV	Numbers	30	8	But if her husband disallow her in the day that he heareth it, then he shall make void her vow which is upon her, and the rash utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul: and Jehovah will forgive her.	4
ASV	Numbers	30	9	But the vow of a widow, or of her that is divorced, even everything wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand against her.	4
ASV	Numbers	30	10	And if she vowed in her husbands house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath,	4
ASV	Numbers	30	11	and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.	4
ASV	Numbers	30	12	But if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them, then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and Jehovah will forgive her.	4
ASV	Numbers	30	13	Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.	4
ASV	Numbers	30	14	But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day, then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he hath established them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.	4
ASV	Numbers	30	15	But if he shall make them null and void after that he hath heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity.	4
ASV	Numbers	30	16	These are the statutes, which Jehovah commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth, in her fathers house.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	31	2	Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	3	And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm ye men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute Jehovahs vengeance on Midian.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	4	Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	5	So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	6	And Moses sent them, a thousand of every tribe, to the war, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	7	And they warred against Midian, as Jehovah commanded Moses; and they slew every male.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	8	And they slew the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	9	And the children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones; and all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods, they took for a prey.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	10	And all their cities in the places wherein they dwelt, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	11	And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man and of beast.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	12	And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and unto Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	13	And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	14	And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	15	And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?	4
ASV	Numbers	31	16	Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against Jehovah in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	17	Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	18	But all the women-children, that have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	19	And encamp ye without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, ye and your captives.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	20	And as to every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats hair, and all things made of wood, ye shall purify yourselves.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	21	And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war that went to the battle, This is the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded Moses:	4
ASV	Numbers	31	22	howbeit the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,	4
ASV	Numbers	31	23	everything that may abide the fire, ye shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water for impurity: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make to go through the water.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	24	And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean; and afterward ye shall come into the camp.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	25	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	31	26	Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers houses of the congregation;	4
ASV	Numbers	31	27	and divide the prey into two parts: between the men skilled in war, that went out to battle, and all the congregation.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	28	And levy a tribute unto Jehovah of the men of war that went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the oxen, and of the asses, and of the flocks:	4
ASV	Numbers	31	29	take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for Jehovahs heave-offering.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	30	And of the children of Israels half, thou shalt take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the oxen, of the asses, and of the flocks, even of all the cattle, and give them unto the Levites, that keep the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	31	And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Jehovah commanded Moses.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	32	Now the prey, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,	4
ASV	Numbers	31	33	and threescore and twelve thousand oxen,	4
ASV	Numbers	31	34	and threescore and one thousand asses,	4
ASV	Numbers	31	35	and thirty and two thousand persons in all, of the women that had not known man by lying with him.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	36	And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep:	4
ASV	Numbers	31	37	and Jehovahs tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	38	And the oxen were thirty and six thousand; of which Jehovahs tribute was threescore and twelve.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	39	And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which Jehovahs tribute was threescore and one.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	40	And the persons were sixteen thousand; of whom Jehovahs tribute was thirty and two persons.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	41	And Moses gave the tribute, which was Jehovahs heave-offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as Jehovah commanded Moses.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	42	And of the children of Israels half, which Moses divided off from the men that warred,	4
ASV	Numbers	31	43	(now the congregations half was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand, seven thousand and five hundred sheep,	4
ASV	Numbers	31	44	and thirty and six thousand oxen,	4
ASV	Numbers	31	45	and thirty thousand and five hundred asses,	4
ASV	Numbers	31	46	and sixteen thousand persons),	4
ASV	Numbers	31	47	even of the children of Israels half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, that kept the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	48	And the officers that were over the thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses;	4
ASV	Numbers	31	49	and they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war that are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	50	And we have brought Jehovahs oblation, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, ankle-chains, and bracelets, signet-rings, ear-rings, and armlets, to make atonement for our souls before Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	51	And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	52	And all the gold of the heave-offering that they offered up to Jehovah, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.	4
ASV	Numbers	31	53	(For the men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.)	4
ASV	Numbers	31	54	And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, for a memorial for the children of Israel before Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	1	Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;	4
ASV	Numbers	32	2	the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	32	3	Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon,	4
ASV	Numbers	32	4	the land which Jehovah smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle; and thy servants have cattle.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	5	And they said, If we have found favor in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession; bring us not over the Jordan.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	6	And Moses said unto the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to the war, and shall ye sit here?	4
ASV	Numbers	32	7	And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which Jehovah hath given them?	4
ASV	Numbers	32	8	Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	9	For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which Jehovah had given them.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	10	And Jehovahs anger was kindled in that day, and he sware, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	32	11	Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:	4
ASV	Numbers	32	12	save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; because they have wholly followed Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	13	And Jehovahs anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander to and fro in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of Jehovah, was consumed.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	14	And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of Jehovah toward Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	15	For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye will destroy all this people.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	16	And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:	4
ASV	Numbers	32	17	but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	18	We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	19	For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan, and forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	20	And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will arm yourselves to go before Jehovah to the war,	4
ASV	Numbers	32	21	and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before Jehovah, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,	4
ASV	Numbers	32	22	and the land is subdued before Jehovah; then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless towards Jehovah, and towards Israel; and this land shall be unto you for a possession before Jehovah.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	23	But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against Jehovah; and be sure your sin will find you out.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	24	Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	25	And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	26	Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead;	4
ASV	Numbers	32	27	but thy servants will pass over, every man that is armed for war, before Jehovah to battle, as my lord saith.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	28	So Moses gave charge concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers houses of the tribes of the children of Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	29	And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man that is armed to battle, before Jehovah, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a p	4
ASV	Numbers	32	30	but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	31	And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As Jehovah hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	32	We will pass over armed before Jehovah into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	33	And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to the cities	4
ASV	Numbers	32	34	And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,	4
ASV	Numbers	32	35	and Atrothshophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah,	4
ASV	Numbers	32	36	and Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran: fortified cities, and folds for sheep.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	37	And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,	4
ASV	Numbers	32	38	and Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Sibmah: and they gave other names unto the cities which they builded.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	39	And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites that were therein.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	40	And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	41	And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the towns thereof, and called them Havvoth-jair.	4
ASV	Numbers	32	42	And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	1	These are the journeys of the children of Israel, when they went forth out of the land of Egypt by their hosts under the hand of Moses and Aaron.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	2	And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of Jehovah: and these are their journeys according to their goings out.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	3	And they journeyed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians,	4
ASV	Numbers	33	4	while the Egyptians were burying all their first-born, whom Jehovah had smitten among them: upon their gods also Jehovah executed judgments.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	5	And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses, and encamped in Succoth.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	6	And they journeyed from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	7	And they journeyed from Etham, and turned back unto Pihahiroth, which is before Baal-zephon: and they encamped before Migdol.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	8	And they journeyed from before Hahiroth, and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness: and they went three days journey in the wilderness of Etham, and encamped in Marah.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	9	And they journeyed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim were twelve springs of water, and threescore and ten palm-trees; and they encamped there.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	10	And they journeyed from Elim, and encamped by the Red Sea.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	11	And they journeyed from the Red Sea, and encamped in the wilderness of Sin.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	12	And they journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	13	And they journeyed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	14	And they journeyed from Alush, and encamped in Rephidim, where was no water for the people to drink.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	15	And they journeyed from Rephidim, and encamped in the wilderness of Sinai.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	16	And they journeyed from the wilderness of Sinai, and encamped in Kibroth-hattaavah.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	17	And they journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah, and encamped in Hazeroth.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	18	And they journeyed from Hazeroth, and encamped in Rithmah.	4

ASV	Numbers	33	20	And they journeyed from Rimmon-perez, and encamped in Libnah.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	21	And they journeyed from Libnah, and encamped in Rissah.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	22	And they journeyed from Rissah, and encamped in Kehelathah.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	23	And they journeyed from Kehelathah, and encamped in mount Shepher.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	24	And they journeyed from mount Shepher, and encamped in Haradah.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	25	And they journeyed from Haradah, and encamped in Makheloth.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	26	And they journeyed from Makheloth, and encamped in Tahath.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	27	And they journeyed from Tahath, and encamped in Terah.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	28	And they journeyed from Terah, and encamped in Mithkah.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	29	And they journeyed from Mithkah, and encamped in Hashmonah.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	30	And they journeyed from Hashmonah, and encamped in Moseroth.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	31	And they journeyed from Moseroth, and encamped in Bene-jaakan.	4

ASV	Numbers	33	34	And they journeyed from Jotbathah, and encamped in Abronah.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	35	And they journeyed from Abronah, and encamped in Ezion-geber.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	36	And they journeyed from Ezion-geber, and encamped in the wilderness of Zin (the same is Kadesh).	4
ASV	Numbers	33	37	And they journeyed from Kadesh, and encamped in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	38	And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of Jehovah, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first day of the month.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	39	And Aaron was a hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	40	And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who dwelt in the South in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	41	And they journeyed from mount Hor, and encamped in Zalmonah.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	42	And they journeyed from Zalmonah, and encamped in Punon.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	43	And they journeyed from Punon, and encamped in Oboth.	4

ASV	Numbers	33	48	And they journeyed from the mountains of Abarim, and encamped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	49	And they encamped by the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth even unto Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	50	And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	33	51	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,	4
ASV	Numbers	33	52	then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their figured stones, and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places:	4
ASV	Numbers	33	53	and ye shall take possession of the land, and dwell therein; for unto you have I given the land to possess it.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	54	And ye shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance: wheresoever the lot falleth to any man, that shall be his; according to the tribes of y	4
ASV	Numbers	33	55	But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then shall those that ye let remain of them be as pricks in your eyes, and as thorns in your sides, and they shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.	4
ASV	Numbers	33	56	And it shall come to pass, that, as I thought to do unto them, so will I do unto you.	4
ASV	Numbers	34	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	34	2	Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according to the borders thereof),	4
ASV	Numbers	34	3	then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the side of Edom, and your south border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward;	4
ASV	Numbers	34	4	and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass along to Zin; and the goings out thereof shall be southward of Kadesh-barnea; and it shall go forth to Hazar-addar, and pass along to Azmon;	4
ASV	Numbers	34	5	and the border shall turn about from Azmon unto the brook of Egypt, and the goings out thereof shall be at the sea.	4
ASV	Numbers	34	6	And for the western border, ye shall have the great sea and the border thereof: this shall be your west border.	4
ASV	Numbers	34	7	And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall mark out for you mount Hor;	4
ASV	Numbers	34	8	from mount Hor ye shall mark out unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad;	4
ASV	Numbers	34	9	and the border shall go forth to Ziphron, and the goings out thereof shall be at Hazar-enan: this shall be your north border.	4
ASV	Numbers	34	10	And ye shall mark out your east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham;	4
ASV	Numbers	34	11	and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down, and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward;	4
ASV	Numbers	34	12	and the border shall go down to the Jordan, and the goings out thereof shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land according to the borders thereof round about.	4
ASV	Numbers	34	13	And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which Jehovah hath commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half-tribe;	4
ASV	Numbers	34	14	for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their fathers houses, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to their fathers houses, have received, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received, their inheritance:	4
ASV	Numbers	34	15	the two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising.	4
ASV	Numbers	34	16	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	34	17	These are the names of the men that shall divide the land unto you for inheritance: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.	4
ASV	Numbers	34	18	And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land for inheritance.	4
ASV	Numbers	34	19	And these are the names of the men: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.	4
ASV	Numbers	34	20	And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.	4
ASV	Numbers	34	21	Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.	4
ASV	Numbers	34	22	And of the tribe of the children of Dan a prince, Bukki the son of Jogli.	4
ASV	Numbers	34	23	Of the children of Joseph: of the tribe of the children of Manasseh a prince, Hanniel the son of Ephod.	4
ASV	Numbers	34	24	And of the tribe of the children of Ephraim a prince, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan.	4
ASV	Numbers	34	25	And of the tribe of the children of Zebulun a prince, Elizaphan the son of Parnach.	4
ASV	Numbers	34	26	And of the tribe of the children of Issachar a prince, Paltiel the son of Azzan.	4
ASV	Numbers	34	27	And of the tribe of the children of Asher a prince, Ahihud the son of Shelomi.	4
ASV	Numbers	34	28	And of the tribe of the children of Naphtali a prince, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.	4
ASV	Numbers	34	29	These are they whom Jehovah commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.	4
ASV	Numbers	35	1	And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	35	2	Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and suburbs for the cities round about them shall ye give unto the Levites.	4
ASV	Numbers	35	3	And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and their suburbs shall be for their cattle, and for their substance, and for all their beasts.	4
ASV	Numbers	35	4	And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.	4
ASV	Numbers	35	5	And ye shall measure without the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst. This shall be to t	4
ASV	Numbers	35	6	And the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites, they shall be the six cities of refuge, which ye shall give for the manslayer to flee unto: and besides them ye shall give forty and two cities.	4
ASV	Numbers	35	7	All the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities; them shall ye give with their suburbs.	4
ASV	Numbers	35	8	And concerning the cities which ye shall give of the possession of the children of Israel, from the many ye shall take many; and from the few ye shall take few: every one according to his inheritance which he inheriteth shall give of his cities unto the L	4
ASV	Numbers	35	9	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,	4
ASV	Numbers	35	10	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,	4
ASV	Numbers	35	11	then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer that killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither.	4
ASV	Numbers	35	12	And the cities shall be unto you for refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation for judgment.	4
ASV	Numbers	35	13	And the cities which ye shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge.	4
ASV	Numbers	35	14	Ye shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan; they shall be cities of refuge.	4
ASV	Numbers	35	15	For the children of Israel, and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them, shall these six cities be for refuge; that every one that killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither.	4
ASV	Numbers	35	16	But if he smote him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.	4
ASV	Numbers	35	17	And if he smote him with a stone in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.	4
ASV	Numbers	35	18	Or if he smote him with a weapon of wood in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.	4
ASV	Numbers	35	19	The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death: when he meeteth him, he shall put him to death.	4
ASV	Numbers	35	20	And if he thrust him of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died,	4
ASV	Numbers	35	21	or in enmity smote him with his hand, so that he died; he that smote him shall surely be put to death; he is a murderer: the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when he meeteth him.	4
ASV	Numbers	35	22	But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled upon him anything without lying in wait,	4
ASV	Numbers	35	23	or with any stone, whereby a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm;	4
ASV	Numbers	35	24	then the congregation shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances;	4
ASV	Numbers	35	25	and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who was anointed wi	4
ASV	Numbers	35	26	But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, whither he fleeth,	4
ASV	Numbers	35	27	and the avenger of blood find him without the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood slay the manslayer; he shall not be guilty of blood,	4
ASV	Numbers	35	28	because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession.	4
ASV	Numbers	35	29	And these things shall be for a statute and ordinance unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.	4
ASV	Numbers	35	30	Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die.	4
ASV	Numbers	35	31	Moreover ye shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer, that is guilty of death; but he shall surely be put to death.	4
ASV	Numbers	35	32	And ye shall take no ransom for him that is fled to his city of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.	4
ASV	Numbers	35	33	So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood, it polluteth the land; and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.	4
ASV	Numbers	35	34	And thou shalt not defile the land which ye inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell: for I, Jehovah, dwell in the midst of the children of Israel.	4
ASV	Numbers	36	1	And the heads of the fathers houses of the family of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers houses of the c	4
ASV	Numbers	36	2	and they said, Jehovah commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.	4
ASV	Numbers	36	3	And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will	4
ASV	Numbers	36	4	And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be added unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.	4
ASV	Numbers	36	5	And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of Jehovah, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaketh right.	4
ASV	Numbers	36	6	This is the thing which Jehovah doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married.	4
ASV	Numbers	36	7	So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.	4
ASV	Numbers	36	8	And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers.	4
ASV	Numbers	36	9	So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave every one to his own inheritance.	4
ASV	Numbers	36	10	Even as Jehovah commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:	4
ASV	Numbers	36	11	for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their fathers brothers sons.	4
ASV	Numbers	36	12	They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.	4
ASV	Numbers	36	13	These are the commandments and the ordinances which Jehovah commanded by Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.	4
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	1	These are the words which Moses spake unto all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah over against Suph, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Di-zahab.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	2	It is eleven days journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadesh-barnea.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	3	And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that Jehovah had given him in commandment unto them;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	4	after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth, at Edrei.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	5	Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	6	Jehovah our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	7	turn you, and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the Arabah, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the South, and by the sea-shore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, a	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	8	Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which Jehovah sware unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	9	And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	10	Jehovah your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	11	Jehovah, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	12	How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	13	Take you wise men, and understanding, and known, according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	14	And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	15	So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	16	And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the sojourner that is with him.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	17	Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; ye shall hear the small and the great alike; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is Gods: and the cause that is too hard for you ye shall bring unto me, and I will hear it.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	18	And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	19	And we journeyed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw, by the way to the hill-country of the Amorites, as Jehovah our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	20	And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the hill-country of the Amorites, which Jehovah our God giveth unto us.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	21	Behold, Jehovah thy God hath set the land before thee: go up, take possession, as Jehovah, the God of thy fathers, hath spoken unto thee; fear not, neither be dismayed.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	22	And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities unto which we shall come.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	23	And the thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	24	and they turned and went up into the hill-country, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	25	And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which Jehovah our God giveth unto us.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	26	Yet ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah your God:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	27	and ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because Jehovah hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	28	Whither are we going up? our brethren have made our heart to melt, saying, The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	29	Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	30	Jehovah your God who goeth before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	31	and in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that Jehovah thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came unto this place.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	32	Yet in this thing ye did not believe Jehovah your God,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	33	who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and in the cloud by day.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	34	And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	35	Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see the good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	36	save Caleb the son of Jephunneh: he shall see it; and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed Jehovah.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	37	Also Jehovah was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	38	Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage thou him; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	39	Moreover your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, and your children, that this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	40	But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	41	Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against Jehovah, we will go up and fight, according to all that Jehovah our God commanded us. And ye girded on every man his weapons of war, and were forward to go up into the hill-country.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	42	And Jehovah said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	43	So I spake unto you, and ye hearkened not; but ye rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill-country.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	44	And the Amorites, that dwelt in that hill-country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even unto Hormah.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	45	And ye returned and wept before Jehovah; but Jehovah hearkened not to your voice, nor gave ear unto you.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	1	46	So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	1	Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as Jehovah spake unto me; and we compassed mount Seir many days.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	2	And Jehovah spake unto me, saying,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	3	Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	4	And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	5	contend not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	6	Ye shall purchase food of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	7	For Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hand; he hath known thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years Jehovah thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	8	So we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion-geber. And we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	9	And Jehovah said unto me, Vex not Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give thee of his land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	10	(The Emim dwelt therein aforetime, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	11	these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	12	The Horites also dwelt in Seir aforetime, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which Jehovah gave unto them.)	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	13	Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	14	And the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, were thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as Jehovah sware unto them.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	15	Moreover the hand of Jehovah was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	16	So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	17	that Jehovah spake unto me, saying,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	18	Thou art this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	19	and when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, vex them not, nor contend with them; for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	20	(That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim dwelt therein aforetime; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	21	a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Jehovah destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	22	as he did for the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	23	and the Avvim, that dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, that came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	24	Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon: behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	25	This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the peoples that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	26	And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	27	Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the highway, I will turn neither unto the right hand nor to the left.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	28	Thou shalt sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only let me pass through on my feet,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	29	as the children of Esau that dwell in Seir, and the Moabites that dwell in Ar, did unto me; until I shall pass over the Jordan into the land which Jehovah our God giveth us.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	30	But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for Jehovah thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as at this day.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	31	And Jehovah said unto me, Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	32	Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Jahaz.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	33	And Jehovah our God delivered him up before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	34	And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones; we left none remaining:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	35	only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	36	From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley, even unto Gilead, there was not a city too high for us; Jehovah our God delivered up all before us:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	2	37	only to the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not near; all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill-country, and wheresoever Jehovah our God forbade us.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	1	Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Edrei.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	2	And Jehovah said unto me, Fear him not; for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	3	So Jehovah our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	4	And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we took not from them; threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	5	All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides the unwalled towns a great many.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	6	And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	7	But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey unto ourselves.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	8	And we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon unto mount Hermon;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	9	(which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir;)	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	10	all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	11	(For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	12	And this land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill-country of Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	13	and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	14	Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth-jair, unto this day.)	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	15	And I gave Gilead unto Machir.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	16	And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and the border thereof, even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	17	the Arabah also, and the Jordan and the border thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	18	And I commanded you at that time, saying, Jehovah your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all the men of valor.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	19	But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	20	until Jehovah give rest unto your brethren, as unto you, and they also possess the land which Jehovah your God giveth them beyond the Jordan: then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	21	And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that Jehovah your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall Jehovah do unto all the kingdoms whither thou goest over.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	22	Ye shall not fear them; for Jehovah your God, he it is that fighteth for you.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	23	And I besought Jehovah at that time, saying,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	24	O Lord Jehovah, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness, and thy strong hand: for what god is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy mighty acts?	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	25	Let me go over, I pray thee, and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	26	But Jehovah was wroth with me for your sakes, and hearkened not unto me; and Jehovah said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	27	Get thee up unto the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	28	But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	3	29	So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	1	And now, O Israel, hearken unto the statutes and unto the ordinances, which I teach you, to do them; that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which Jehovah, the God of your fathers, giveth you.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	2	Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish from it, that ye may keep the commandments of Jehovah your God which I command you.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	3	Your eyes have seen what Jehovah did because of Baal-peor; for all the men that followed Baal-peor, Jehovah thy God hath destroyed them from the midst of thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	4	But ye that did cleave unto Jehovah your God are alive every one of you this day.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	5	Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as Jehovah my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the midst of the land whither ye go in to possess it.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	6	Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, that shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	7	For what great nation is there, that hath a god so nigh unto them, as Jehovah our God is whensoever we call upon him?	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	8	And what great nation is there, that hath statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	9	Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes saw, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life; but make them known unto thy children and thy childrens children;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	10	the day that thou stoodest before Jehovah thy God in Horeb, when Jehovah said unto me, Assemble me the people, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live upon the earth, and that they may teach their chi	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	11	And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the heart of heaven, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	12	And Jehovah spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of words, but ye saw no form; only ye heard a voice.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	13	And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	14	And Jehovah commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	15	Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of form on the day that Jehovah spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	16	Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	17	the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flieth in the heavens,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	18	the likeness of anything that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	19	and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven, thou be drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which Jehovah thy God hath allotted unto all the peoples under the whol	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	20	But Jehovah hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as at this day.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	21	Furthermore Jehovah was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	22	but I must die in this land, I must not go over the Jordan; but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	23	Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of Jehovah your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image in the form of anything which Jehovah thy God hath forbidden thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	24	For Jehovah thy God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	25	When thou shalt beget children, and childrens children, and ye shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image in the form of anything, and shall do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah thy God, to provoke him	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	26	I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over the Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	27	And Jehovah will scatter you among the peoples, and ye shall be left few in number among the nations, whither Jehovah shall lead you away.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	28	And there ye shall serve gods, the work of mens hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	29	But from thence ye shall seek Jehovah thy God, and thou shalt find him, when thou searchest after him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	30	When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, in the latter days thou shalt return to Jehovah thy God, and hearken unto his voice:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	31	for Jehovah thy God is a merciful God; he will not fail thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	32	For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and from the one end of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	33	Did ever a people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	34	Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Jehovah your God did for you i	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	35	Unto thee it was showed, that thou mightest know that Jehovah he is God; there is none else besides him.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	36	Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he made thee to see his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	37	And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	38	to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as at this day.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	39	Know therefore this day, and lay it to thy heart, that Jehovah he is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath; there is none else.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	40	And thou shalt keep his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days in the land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, for ever.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	41	Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	42	that the manslayer might flee thither, that slayeth his neighbor unawares, and hated him not in time past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	43	namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	44	And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	45	these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, when they came forth out of Egypt,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	46	beyond the Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, when they came forth out of Egypt.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	47	And they took his land in possession, and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	48	from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, even unto mount Sion (the same is Hermon),	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	4	49	and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	1	And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and observe to do them.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	2	Jehovah our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	3	Jehovah made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	4	Jehovah spake with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	5	(I stood between Jehovah and you at that time, to show you the word of Jehovah: for ye were afraid because of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	6	I am Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	7	Thou shalt have no other gods before me.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	8	Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	9	thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them; for I, Jehovah, thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	10	and showing lovingkindness unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	11	Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain: for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	12	Observe the sabbath day, to keep it holy, as Jehovah thy God commanded thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	13	Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	14	but the seventh day is a sabbath unto Jehovah thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within th	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	15	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah thy God brought thee out thence by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm: therefore Jehovah thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	16	Honor thy father and thy mother, as Jehovah thy God commanded thee; that thy days may be long, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	17	Thou shalt not kill.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	18	Neither shalt thou commit adultery.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	19	Neither shalt thou steal.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	20	Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbor.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	21	Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbors wife; neither shalt thou desire thy neighbors house, his field, or his man-servant, or his maid-servant, his ox, or his ass, or anything that is thy neighbors.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	22	These words Jehovah spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them upon two tables of stone, and gave them unto me.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	23	And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	24	and ye said, Behold, Jehovah our God hath showed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth speak with man, and he liveth.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	25	Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of Jehovah our God any more, then we shall die.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	26	For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	27	Go thou near, and hear all that Jehovah our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that Jehovah our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	28	And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and Jehovah said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	29	Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	30	Go say to them, Return ye to your tents.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	31	But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	32	Ye shall observe to do therefore as Jehovah your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	5	33	Ye shall walk in all the way which Jehovah your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	1	Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the ordinances, which Jehovah your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	2	that thou mightest fear Jehovah thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy sons son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	3	Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as Jehovah, the God of thy fathers, hath promised unto thee, in a land flowing with milk and honey.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	4	Hear, O Israel: Jehovah our God is one Jehovah:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	5	and thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	6	And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	7	and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	8	And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	9	And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	10	And it shall be, when Jehovah thy God shall bring thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee, great and goodly cities, which thou buildest not,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	11	and houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and cisterns hewn out, which thou hewedst not, vineyards and olive-trees, which thou plantedst not, and thou shalt eat and be full;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	12	then beware lest thou forget Jehovah, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	13	Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God; and him shalt thou serve, and shalt swear by his name.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	14	Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples that are round about you;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	15	for Jehovah thy God in the midst of thee is a jealous God; lest the anger of Jehovah thy God be kindled against thee, and he destroy thee from off the face of the earth.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	16	Ye shall not tempt Jehovah your God, as ye tempted him in Massah.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	17	Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of Jehovah your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	18	And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of Jehovah; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which Jehovah sware unto thy fathers,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	19	to thrust out all thine enemies from before thee, as Jehovah hath spoken.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	20	When thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Jehovah our God hath commanded you?	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	21	then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaohs bondmen in Egypt: and Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	22	and Jehovah showed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his house, before our eyes;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	23	and he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	24	And Jehovah commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Jehovah our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as at this day.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	6	25	And it shall be righteousness unto us, if we observe to do all this commandment before Jehovah our God, as he hath commanded us.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	1	When Jehovah thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and shall cast out many nations before thee, the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, se	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	2	and when Jehovah thy God shall deliver them up before thee, and thou shalt smite them; then thou shalt utterly destroy them: thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	3	neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	4	For he will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of Jehovah be kindled against you, and he will destroy thee quickly.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	5	But thus shall ye deal with them: ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and hew down their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	6	For thou art a holy people unto Jehovah thy God: Jehovah thy God hath chosen thee to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples that are upon the face of the earth.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	7	Jehovah did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all peoples:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	8	but because Jehovah loveth you, and because he would keep the oath which he sware unto your fathers, hath Jehovah brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	9	Know therefore that Jehovah thy God, he is God, the faithful God, who keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	10	and repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	11	Thou shalt therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which I command thee this day, to do them.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	12	And it shall come to pass, because ye hearken to these ordinances, and keep and do them, that Jehovah thy God will keep with thee the covenant and the lovingkindness which he sware unto thy fathers:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	13	and he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee; he will also bless the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground, thy grain and thy new wine and thine oil, the increase of thy cattle and the young of thy flock, in the land which he sware unt	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	14	Thou shalt be blessed above all peoples: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	15	And Jehovah will take away from thee all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, will he put upon thee, but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	16	And thou shalt consume all the peoples that Jehovah thy God shall deliver unto thee; thine eye shall not pity them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	17	If thou shalt say in thy heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	18	thou shalt not be afraid of them: thou shalt well remember what Jehovah thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	19	the great trials which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, whereby Jehovah thy God brought thee out: so shall Jehovah thy God do unto all the peoples of whom thou art afraid.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	20	Moreover Jehovah thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves, perish from before thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	21	Thou shalt not be affrighted at them; for Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, a great God and a terrible.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	22	And Jehovah thy God will cast out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	23	But Jehovah thy God will deliver them up before thee, and will discomfit them with a great discomfiture, until they be destroyed.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	24	And he will deliver their kings into thy hand, and thou shalt make their name to perish from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	25	The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein; for it is an abomination to Jehovah thy God.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	7	26	And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house, and become a devoted thing like unto it: thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	8	1	All the commandment which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which Jehovah sware unto your fathers.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	8	2	And thou shalt remember all the way which Jehovah thy God hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble thee, to prove thee, to know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or not.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	8	3	And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by everything that proceedeth out of the mouth of Jehov	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	8	4	Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	8	5	And thou shalt consider in thy heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so Jehovah thy God chasteneth thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	8	6	And thou shalt keep the commandments of Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	8	7	For Jehovah thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing forth in valleys and hills;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	8	8	a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig-trees and pomegranates; a land of olive-trees and honey;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	8	9	a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig copper.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	8	10	And thou shalt eat and be full, and thou shalt bless Jehovah thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	8	11	Beware lest thou forget Jehovah thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his ordinances, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	8	12	lest, when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	8	13	and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	8	14	then thy heart be lifted up, and thou forget Jehovah thy God, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	8	15	who led thee through the great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty ground where was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	8	16	who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not; that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	8	17	and lest thou say in thy heart, My power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	8	18	But thou shalt remember Jehovah thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth; that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as at this day.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	8	19	And it shall be, if thou shalt forget Jehovah thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	8	20	As the nations that Jehovah maketh to perish before you, so shall ye perish; because ye would not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah your God.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	1	Hear, O Israel: thou art to pass over the Jordan this day, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fortified up to heaven,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	2	a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the sons of Anak?	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	3	Know therefore this day, that Jehovah thy God is he who goeth over before thee as a devouring fire; he will destroy them, and he will bring them down before thee: so shalt thou drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as Jehovah hath spoken unto t	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	4	Speak not thou in thy heart, after that Jehovah thy God hath thrust them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness Jehovah hath brought me in to possess this land; whereas for the wickedness of these nations Jehovah doth drive them out from befor	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	5	Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thy heart, dost thou go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations Jehovah thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may establish the word which Jehovah sware unt	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	6	Know therefore, that Jehovah thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	7	Remember, forget thou not, how thou provokedst Jehovah thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou wentest forth out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against Jehovah.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	8	Also in Horeb ye provoked Jehovah to wrath, and Jehovah was angry with you to destroy you.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	9	When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which Jehovah made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	10	And Jehovah delivered unto me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which Jehovah speak with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	11	And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Jehovah gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	12	And Jehovah said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	13	Furthermore Jehovah spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	14	let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	15	So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount was burning with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	16	And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against Jehovah your God; ye had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which Jehovah had commanded you.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	17	And I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	18	And I fell down before Jehovah, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water; because of all your sin which ye sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	19	For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith Jehovah was wroth against you to destroy you. But Jehovah hearkened unto me that time also.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	20	And Jehovah was very angry with Aaron to destroy him: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	21	And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	22	And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked Jehovah to wrath.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	23	And when Jehovah sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	24	Ye have been rebellious against Jehovah from the day that I knew you.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	25	So I fell down before Jehovah the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Jehovah had said he would destroy you.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	26	And I prayed unto Jehovah, and said, O Lord Jehovah, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, that thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	27	Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	28	lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because Jehovah was not able to bring them into the land which he promised unto them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	9	29	Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy great power and by thine outstretched arm.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	10	1	At that time Jehovah said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	10	2	And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	10	3	So I made an ark of acacia wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in my hand.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	10	4	And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which Jehovah spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and Jehovah gave them unto me.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	10	5	And I turned and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are as Jehovah commanded me.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	10	6	(And the children of Israel journeyed from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priests office in his stead.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	10	7	From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	10	8	At that time Jehovah set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, to stand before Jehovah to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	10	9	Wherefore Levi hath no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; Jehovah is his inheritance, according as Jehovah thy God spake unto him.)	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	10	10	And I stayed in the mount, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights: and Jehovah hearkened unto me that time also; Jehovah would not destroy thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	10	11	And Jehovah said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	10	12	And now, Israel, what doth Jehovah thy God require of thee, but to fear Jehovah thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	10	13	to keep the commandments of Jehovah, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	10	14	Behold, unto Jehovah thy God belongeth heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that is therein.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	10	15	Only Jehovah had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all peoples, as at this day.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	10	16	Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	10	17	For Jehovah your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the terrible, who regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	10	18	He doth execute justice for the fatherless and widow, and loveth the sojourner, in giving him food and raiment.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	10	19	Love ye therefore the sojourner; for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	10	20	Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God; him shalt thou serve; and to him shalt thou cleave, and by his name shalt thou swear.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	10	21	He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	10	22	Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now Jehovah thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	1	Therefore thou shalt love Jehovah thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his ordinances, and his commandments, alway.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	2	And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children that have not known, and that have not seen the chastisement of Jehovah your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his outstretched arm,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	3	and his signs, and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	4	and what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how Jehovah hath destroyed them unto this day;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	5	and what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came unto this place;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	6	and what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	7	but your eyes have seen all the great work of Jehovah which he did.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	8	Therefore shall ye keep all the commandment which I command thee this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go over to possess it;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	9	and that ye may prolong your days in the land, which Jehovah sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	10	For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	11	but the land, whither ye go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	12	a land which Jehovah thy God careth for: the eyes of Jehovah thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	13	And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love Jehovah your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	14	that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy grain, and thy new wine, and thine oil.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	15	And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle, and thou shalt eat and be full.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	16	Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	17	and the anger of Jehovah be kindled against you, and he shut up the heavens, so that there shall be no rain, and the land shall not yield its fruit; and ye perish quickly from off the good land which Jehovah giveth you.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	18	Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul; and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	19	And ye shall teach them your children, talking of them, when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	20	And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	21	that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which Jehovah sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	22	For if ye shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you, to do it, to love Jehovah your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	23	then will Jehovah drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	24	Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the hinder sea shall be your border.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	25	There shall no man be able to stand before you: Jehovah your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath spoken unto you.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	26	Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	27	the blessing, if ye shall hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah your God, which I command you this day;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	28	and the curse, if ye shall not hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	29	And it shall come to pass, when Jehovah thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt set the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	30	Are they not beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites that dwell in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	31	For ye are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	11	32	And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you this day.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	1	These are the statutes and the ordinances which ye shall observe to do in the land which Jehovah, the God of thy fathers, hath given thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	2	Ye shall surely destroy all the places wherein the nations that ye shall dispossess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	3	and ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and burn their Asherim with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods; and ye shall destroy their name out of that place.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	4	Ye shall not do so unto Jehovah your God.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	5	But unto the place which Jehovah your God shall choose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	6	and thither ye shall bring your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill-offerings, and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	7	and there ye shall eat before Jehovah your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	8	Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	9	for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	10	But when ye go over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which Jehovah your God causeth you to inherit, and he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	11	then it shall come to pass that to the place which Jehovah your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, thither shall ye bring all that I command you: your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	12	And ye shall rejoice before Jehovah your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and the Levite that is within your gates, forasmuch as he hath no portion nor inheritance with you.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	13	Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	14	but in the place which Jehovah shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	15	Notwithstanding, thou mayest kill and eat flesh within all thy gates, after all the desire of thy soul, according to the blessing of Jehovah thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the gazelle, and as of the hart	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	16	Only ye shall not eat the blood; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	17	Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy grain, or of thy new wine, or of thine oil, or the firstlings of thy herd or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill-offerings, nor the heave-offering of thy hand;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	18	but thou shalt eat them before Jehovah thy God in the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before Jehovah	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	19	Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest in thy land.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	20	When Jehovah thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul desireth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, after all the desire of thy soul.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	21	If the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, to put his name there, be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which Jehovah hath given thee, as I have commanded thee; and thou mayest eat within thy gates, after all the d	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	22	Even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat thereof: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof alike.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	23	Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	24	Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	25	Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	26	Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which Jehovah shall choose:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	27	and thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of Jehovah thy God; and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of Jehovah thy God; and thou shalt eat the flesh.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	28	Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the eyes of Jehovah thy God.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	29	When Jehovah thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest in to dispossess them, and thou dispossessest them, and dwellest in their land;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	30	take heed to thyself that thou be not ensnared to follow them, after that they are destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How do these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	31	Thou shalt not do so unto Jehovah thy God: for every abomination to Jehovah, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	12	32	What thing soever I command you, that shall ye observe to do: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	13	1	If there arise in the midst of thee a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and he give thee a sign or a wonder,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	13	2	and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	13	3	thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or unto that dreamer of dreams: for Jehovah your God proveth you, to know whether ye love Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	13	4	Ye shall walk after Jehovah your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	13	5	And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death, because he hath spoken rebellion against Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage, to draw thee aside out of the way which	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	13	6	If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, that is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	13	7	of the gods of the peoples that are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	13	8	thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	13	9	but thou shalt surely kill him; thy hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	13	10	And thou shalt stone him to death with stones, because he hath sought to draw thee away from Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	13	11	And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do not more any such wickedness as this is in the midst of thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	13	12	If thou shalt hear tell concerning one of thy cities, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to dwell there, saying,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	13	13	Certain base fellows are gone out from the midst of thee, and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	13	14	then shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in the midst of thee,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	13	15	thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	13	16	And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, unto Jehovah thy God: and it shall be a heap for ever; it shall not be built again.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	13	17	And there shall cleave nought of the devoted thing to thy hand; that Jehovah may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and show thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	13	18	when thou shalt hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah thy God.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	1	Ye are the children of Jehovah your God: ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	2	For thou art a holy people unto Jehovah thy God, and Jehovah hath chosen thee to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples that are upon the face of the earth.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	3	Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	4	These are the beasts which ye may eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	5	the hart, and the gazelle, and the roebuck, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the antelope, and the chamois.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	6	And every beast that parteth the hoof, and hath the hoof cloven in two, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that may ye eat.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	7	Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that have the hoof cloven: the camel, and the hare, and the coney; because they chew the cud but part not the hoof, they are unclean unto you.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	8	And the swine, because he parteth the hoof but cheweth not the cud, he is unclean unto you: of their flesh ye shall not eat, and their carcasses ye shall not touch.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	9	These ye may eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales may ye eat;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	10	and whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye shall not eat; it is unclean unto you.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	11	Of all clean birds ye may eat.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	12	But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the gier-eagle, and the ospray,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	13	and the glede, and the falcon, and the kite after its kind,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	14	and every raven after its kind,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	15	and the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the sea-mew, and the hawk after its kind,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	16	the little owl, and the great owl, and the horned owl,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	17	and the pelican, and the vulture, and the cormorant,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	18	and the stork, and the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	19	And all winged creeping things are unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	20	Of all clean birds ye may eat.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	21	Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself: thou mayest give it unto the sojourner that is within thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto a foreigner: for thou art a holy people unto Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	22	Thou shalt surely tithe all the increase of thy seed, that which cometh forth from the field year by year.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	23	And thou shalt eat before Jehovah thy God, in the place which he shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, the tithe of thy grain, of thy new wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herd and of thy flock; that thou mayest learn to fear Jeh	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	24	And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it, because the place is too far from thee, which Jehovah thy God shall choose, to set his name there, when Jehovah thy God shall bless thee;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	25	then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thy hand, and shalt go unto the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	26	and thou shalt bestow the money for whatsoever thy soul desireth, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul asketh of thee; and thou shalt eat there before Jehovah thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou and thy ho	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	27	And the Levite that is within thy gates, thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	28	At the end of every three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase in the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	14	29	and the Levite, because he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy h	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	15	1	At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	15	2	And this is the manner of the release: every creditor shall release that which he hath lent unto his neighbor; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother; because Jehovahs release hath been proclaimed.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	15	3	Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it: but whatsoever of thine is with thy brother thy hand shall release.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	15	4	Howbeit there shall be no poor with thee; (for Jehovah will surely bless thee in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it;)	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	15	5	if only thou diligently hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God, to observe to do all this commandment which I command thee this day.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	15	6	For Jehovah thy God will bless thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt rule over many nations, but they shall not rule over thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	15	7	If there be with thee a poor man, one of thy brethren, within any of thy gates in thy land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thy heart, nor shut thy hand from thy poor brother;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	15	8	but thou shalt surely open thy hand unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need in that which he wanteth.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	15	9	Beware that there be not a base thought in thy heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou give him nought; and he cry unto Jehovah against thee, and it be sin unto thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	15	10	Thou shalt surely give him, and thy heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him; because that for this thing Jehovah thy God will bless thee in all thy work, and in all that thou puttest thy hand unto.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	15	11	For the poor will never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt surely open thy hand unto thy brother, to thy needy, and to thy poor, in thy land.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	15	12	If thy brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	15	13	And when thou lettest him go free from thee, thou shalt not let him go empty:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	15	14	thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy threshing-floor, and out of thy winepress; as Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	15	15	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to-day.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	15	16	And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go out from thee; because he loveth thee and thy house, because he is well with thee;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	15	17	then thou shalt take an awl, and thrust it through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maid-servant thou shalt do likewise.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	15	18	It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou lettest him go free from thee; for to the double of the hire of a hireling hath he served thee six years: and Jehovah thy God will bless thee in all that thou doest.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	15	19	All the firstling males that are born of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto Jehovah thy God: thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy herd, nor shear the firstling of thy flock.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	15	20	Thou shalt eat it before Jehovah thy God year by year in the place which Jehovah shall choose, thou and thy household.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	15	21	And if it have any blemish, as if it be lame or blind, any ill blemish whatsoever, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto Jehovah thy God.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	15	22	Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean shall eat it alike, as the gazelle, and as the hart.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	15	23	Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it out upon the ground as water.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	16	1	Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto Jehovah thy God; for in the month of Abib Jehovah thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	16	2	And thou shalt sacrifice the passover unto Jehovah thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which Jehovah shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	16	3	Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	16	4	And there shall be no leaven seen with thee in all thy borders seven days; neither shall any of the flesh, which thou sacrificest the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	16	5	Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	16	6	but at the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	16	7	And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	16	8	Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread; and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to Jehovah thy God; thou shalt do no work therein.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	16	9	Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: from the time thou beginnest to put the sickle to the standing grain shalt thou begin to number seven weeks.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	16	10	And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto Jehovah thy God with a tribute of a freewill-offering of thy hand, which thou shalt give, according as Jehovah thy God blesseth thee:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	16	11	and thou shalt rejoice before Jehovah thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are in the midst of thee, in	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	16	12	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou shalt observe and do these statutes.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	16	13	Thou shalt keep the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in from thy threshing-floor and from thy winepress:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	16	14	and thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	16	15	Seven days shalt thou keep a feast unto Jehovah thy God in the place which Jehovah shall choose; because Jehovah thy God will bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the work of thy hands, and thou shalt be altogether joyful.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	16	16	Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before Jehovah thy God in the place which he shall choose: in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles; and they shall not appear before Jehovah empty:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	16	17	every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of Jehovah thy God which he hath given thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	16	18	Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, according to thy tribes; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	16	19	Thou shalt not wrest justice: thou shalt not respect persons; neither shalt thou take a bribe; for a bribe doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	16	20	That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	16	21	Thou shalt not plant thee an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of Jehovah thy God, which thou shalt make thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	16	22	Neither shalt thou set thee up a pillar; which Jehovah thy God hateth.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	17	1	Thou shalt not sacrifice unto Jehovah thy God an ox, or a sheep, wherein is a blemish, or anything evil; for that is an abomination unto Jehovah thy God.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	17	2	If there be found in the midst of thee, within any of thy gates which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that doeth that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah thy God, in transgressing his covenant,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	17	3	and hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, or the sun, or the moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	17	4	and it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, then shalt thou inquire diligently; and, behold, if it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in Israel,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	17	5	then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, who hath done this evil thing, unto thy gates, even the man or the woman; and thou shalt stone them to death with stones.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	17	6	At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is to die be put to death; at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	17	7	The hand of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. So thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	17	8	If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates; then shalt thou arise, and get thee up unto the place which Jehovah thy Go	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	17	9	and thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days: and thou shalt inquire; and they shall show thee the sentence of judgment.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	17	10	And thou shalt do according to the tenor of the sentence which they shall show thee from that place which Jehovah shall choose; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they shall teach thee:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	17	11	according to the tenor of the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do; thou shalt not turn aside from the sentence which they shall show thee, to the right hand, nor to the left.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	17	12	And the man that doeth presumptuously, in not hearkening unto the priest that standeth to minister there before Jehovah thy God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	17	13	And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	17	14	When thou art come unto the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are round about me;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	17	15	thou shalt surely set him king over thee, whom Jehovah thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee; thou mayest not put a foreigner over thee, who is not thy brother.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	17	16	Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he may multiply horses; forasmuch as Jehovah hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	17	17	Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	17	18	And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book, out of that which is before the priests the Levites:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	17	19	and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life; that he may learn to fear Jehovah his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	17	20	that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children, in the midst of Israel.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	18	1	The priests the Levites, even all the tribe of Levi, shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, and his inheritance.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	18	2	And they shall have no inheritance among their brethren: Jehovah is their inheritance, as he hath spoken unto them.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	18	3	And this shall be the priests due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	18	4	The first-fruits of thy grain, of thy new wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	18	5	For Jehovah thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand to minister in the name of Jehovah, him and his sons for ever.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	18	6	And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourneth, and come with all the desire of his soul unto the place which Jehovah shall choose;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	18	7	then he shall minister in the name of Jehovah his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, who stand there before Jehovah.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	18	8	They shall have like portions to eat, besides that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	18	9	When thou art come into the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	18	10	There shall not be found with thee any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one that useth divination, one that practiseth augury, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	18	11	or a charmer, or a consulter with a familiar spirit, or a wizard, or a necromancer.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	18	12	For whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto Jehovah: and because of these abominations Jehovah thy God doth drive them out from before thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	18	13	Thou shalt be perfect with Jehovah thy God.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	18	14	For these nations, that thou shalt dispossess, hearken unto them that practise augury, and unto diviners; but as for thee, Jehovah thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	18	15	Jehovah thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	18	16	according to all that thou desiredst of Jehovah thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of Jehovah my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	18	17	And Jehovah said unto me, They have well said that which they have spoken.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	18	18	I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	18	19	And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	18	20	But the prophet, that shall speak a word presumptuously in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	18	21	And if thou say in thy heart, How shall we know the word which Jehovah hath not spoken?	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	18	22	when a prophet speaketh in the name of Jehovah, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which Jehovah hath not spoken: the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously, thou shalt not be afraid of him.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	19	1	When Jehovah thy God shall cut off the nations, whose land Jehovah thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their cities, and in their houses;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	19	2	thou shalt set apart three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess it.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	19	3	Thou shalt prepare thee the way, and divide the borders of thy land, which Jehovah thy God causeth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every manslayer may flee thither.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	19	4	And this is the case of the manslayer, that shall flee thither and live: whoso killeth his neighbor unawares, and hated him not in time past;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	19	5	as when a man goeth into the forest with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbor, so that he dieth; he shall flee unto one of these ci	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	19	6	lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and smite him mortally; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	19	7	Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt set apart three cities for thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	27	For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against Jehovah; and how much more after my death?	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	28	Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	29	For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	30	And Moses spake in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	1	Give ear, ye heavens, and I will speak; And let the earth hear the words of my mouth.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	2	My doctrine shall drop as the rain; My speech shall distil as the dew, As the small rain upon the tender grass, And as the showers upon the herb.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	3	For I will proclaim the name of Jehovah: Ascribe ye greatness unto our God.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	4	The Rock, his work is perfect; For all his ways are justice: A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, Just and right is he.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	5	They have dealt corruptly with him, they are not his children, it is their blemish; They are a perverse and crooked generation.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	6	Do ye thus requite Jehovah, O foolish people and unwise? Is not he thy father that hath bought thee? He hath made thee, and established thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	7	Remember the days of old, Consider the years of many generations: Ask thy father, and he will show thee; Thine elders, and they will tell thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	8	When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, When he separated the children of men, He set the bounds of the peoples According to the number of the children of Israel.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	9	For Jehovahs portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	10	He found him in a desert land, And in the waste howling wilderness; He compassed him about, he cared for him, He kept him as the apple of his eye.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	11	As an eagle that stirreth up her nest, That fluttereth over her young, He spread abroad his wings, he took them, He bare them on his pinions.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	12	Jehovah alone did lead him, And there was no foreign god with him.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	13	He made him ride on the high places of the earth, And he did eat the increase of the field; And he made him to suck honey out of the rock, And oil out of the flinty rock;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	14	Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, With fat of lambs, And rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, With the finest of the wheat; And of the blood of the grape thou drankest wine.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	15	But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: Thou art waxed fat, thou art grown thick, thou art become sleek; Then he forsook God who made him, And lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	16	They moved him to jealousy with strange gods; With abominations provoked they him to anger.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	17	They sacrificed unto demons, which were no God, To gods that they knew not, To new gods that came up of late, Which your fathers dreaded not.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	18	Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, And hast forgotten God that gave thee birth.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	19	And Jehovah saw it, and abhorred them, Because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	20	And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: For they are a very perverse generation, Children in whom is no faithfulness.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	21	They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; They have provoked me to anger with their vanities: And I will move them to jealousy with those that are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	22	For a fire is kindled in mine anger, And burneth unto the lowest Sheol, And devoureth the earth with its increase, And setteth on fire the foundations of the mountains.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	23	I will heap evils upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	24	They shall be wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat And bitter destruction; And the teeth of beasts will I send upon them, With the poison of crawling things of the dust.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	25	Without shall the sword bereave, And in the chambers terror; It shall destroy both young man and virgin, The suckling with the man of gray hairs.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	26	I said, I would scatter them afar, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	27	Were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, Lest their adversaries should judge amiss, Lest they should say, Our hand is exalted, And Jehovah hath not done all this.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	28	For they are a nation void of counsel, And there is no understanding in them.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	29	Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, That they would consider their latter end!	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	30	How should one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight, Except their Rock had sold them, And Jehovah had delivered them up?	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	31	For their rock is not as our Rock, Even our enemies themselves being judges.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	32	For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, And of the fields of Gomorrah: Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	33	Their wine is the poison of serpents, And the cruel venom of asps.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	34	Is not this laid up in store with me, Sealed up among my treasures?	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	35	Vengeance is mine, and recompense, At the time when their foot shall slide: For the day of their calamity is at hand, And the things that are to come upon them shall make haste.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	36	For Jehovah will judge his people, And repent himself for his servants; When he seeth that their power is gone, And there is none remaining, shut up or left at large.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	37	And he will say, Where are their gods, The rock in which they took refuge;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	38	Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, And drank the wine of their drink-offering? Let them rise up and help you, Let them be your protection.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	39	See now that I, even I, am he, And there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal; And there is none that can deliver out of my hand.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	40	For I lift up my hand to heaven, And say, As I live for ever,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	41	If I whet my glittering sword, And my hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine adversaries, And will recompense them that hate me.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	42	I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, And my sword shall devour flesh; With the blood of the slain and the captives, From the head of the leaders of the enemy.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	43	Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: For he will avenge the blood of his servants, And will render vengeance to his adversaries, And will make expiation for his land, for his people.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	44	And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	45	And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	46	And he said unto them, Set your heart unto all the words which I testify unto you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, even all the words of this law.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	47	For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	48	And Jehovah spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	49	Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	50	and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	51	because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	32	52	For thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither into the land which I give the children of Israel.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	1	And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	2	And he said, Jehovah came from Sinai, And rose from Seir unto them; He shined forth from mount Paran, And he came from the ten thousands of holy ones: At his right hand was a fiery law for them.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	3	Yea, he loveth the people; All his saints are in thy hand: And they sat down at thy feet; Every one shall receive of thy words.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	4	Moses commanded us a law, An inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	5	And he was king in Jeshurun, When the heads of the people were gathered, All the tribes of Israel together.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	6	Let Reuben live, and not die; Nor let his men be few.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	7	And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, Jehovah, the voice of Judah, And bring him in unto his people. With his hands he contended for himself; And thou shalt be a help against his adversaries.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	8	And of Levi he said, Thy Thummim and thy Urim are with thy godly one, Whom thou didst prove at Massah, With whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	9	Who said of his father, and of his mother, I have not seen him; Neither did he acknowledge his brethren, Nor knew he his own children: For they have observed thy word, And keep thy covenant.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	10	They shall teach Jacob thine ordinances, And Israel thy law: They shall put incense before thee, And whole burnt-offering upon thine altar.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	11	Bless, Jehovah, his substance, And accept the work of his hands: Smite through the loins of them that rise up against him, And of them that hate him, that they rise not again.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	12	Of Benjamin he said, The beloved of Jehovah shall dwell in safety by him; He covereth him all the day long, And he dwelleth between his shoulders.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	13	And of Joseph he said, Blessed of Jehovah be his land, For the precious things of heaven, for the dew, And for the deep that coucheth beneath,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	14	And for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, And for the precious things of the growth of the moons,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	15	And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, And for the precious things of the everlasting hills,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	16	And for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof, And the good will of him that dwelt in the bush. Let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, And upon the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	17	The firstling of his herd, majesty is his; And his horns are the horns of the wild-ox: With them he shall push the peoples all of them, even the ends of the earth: And they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, And they are the thousands of Manasseh.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	18	And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; And, Issachar, in thy tents.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	19	They shall call the peoples unto the mountain; There shall they offer sacrifices of righteousness: For they shall suck the abundance of the seas, And the hidden treasures of the sand.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	20	And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: He dwelleth as a lioness, And teareth the arm, yea, the crown of the head.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	21	And he provided the first part for himself, For there was the lawgivers portion reserved; And he came with the heads of the people; He executed the righteousness of Jehovah, And his ordinances with Israel.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	22	And of Dan he said, Dan is a lions whelp, That leapeth forth from Bashan.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	23	And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, And full with the blessing of Jehovah, Possess thou the west and the south.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	24	And of Asher he said, Blessed be Asher with children; Let him be acceptable unto his brethren, And let him dip his foot in oil.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	25	Thy bars shall be iron and brass; And as thy days, so shall thy strength be.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	26	There is none like unto God, O Jeshurun, Who rideth upon the heavens for thy help, And in his excellency on the skies.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	27	The eternal God is thy dwelling-place, And underneath are the everlasting arms. And he thrust out the enemy from before thee, And said, Destroy.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	28	And Israel dwelleth in safety, The fountain of Jacob alone, In a land of grain and new wine; Yea, his heavens drop down dew.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	33	29	Happy art thou, O Israel: Who is like unto thee, a people saved by Jehovah, The shield of thy help, And the sword of thy excellency! And thine enemies shall submit themselves unto thee; And thou shalt tread upon their high places.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	34	1	And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And Jehovah showed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	19	8	And if Jehovah thy God enlarge thy border, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	19	9	if thou shalt keep all this commandment to do it, which I command thee this day, to love Jehovah thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, besides these three:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	19	10	that innocent blood be not shed in the midst of thy land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	19	11	But if any man hate his neighbor, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally so that he dieth, and he flee into one of these cities;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	19	12	then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	19	13	Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	19	14	Thou shalt not remove thy neighbors landmark, which they of old time have set, in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit, in the land that Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess it.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	19	15	One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	19	16	If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to testify against him of wrong-doing,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	19	17	then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before Jehovah, before the priests and the judges that shall be in those days;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	19	18	and the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and have testified falsely against his brother;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	19	19	then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to do unto his brother: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	19	20	And those that remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	19	21	And thine eyes shall not pity; life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	20	1	When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, thou shalt not be afraid of them; for Jehovah thy God is with thee, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	20	2	And it shall be, when ye draw nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	20	3	and shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye draw nigh this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your heart faint; fear not, nor tremble, neither be ye affrighted at them;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	20	4	for Jehovah your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	20	5	And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	20	6	And what man is there that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not used the fruit thereof? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man use the fruit thereof.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	20	7	And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	20	8	And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and faint-hearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethrens heart melt as his heart.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	20	9	And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall appoint captains of hosts at the head of the people.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	20	10	When thou drawest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	20	11	And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that are found therein shall become tributary unto thee, and shall serve thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	20	12	And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	20	13	and when Jehovah thy God delivereth it into thy hand, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	20	14	but the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take for a prey unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which Jehovah thy God hath given thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	20	15	Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	20	16	But of the cities of these peoples, that Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	20	17	but thou shalt utterly destroy them: the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; as Jehovah thy God hath commanded thee;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	20	18	that they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so would ye sin against Jehovah your God.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	20	19	When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by wielding an axe against them; for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man, tha	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	20	20	Only the trees of which thou knowest that they are not trees for food, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it fall.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	21	1	If one be found slain in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath smitten him;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	21	2	then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	21	3	and it shall be, that the city which is nearest unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	21	4	and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifers neck there in the valley.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	21	5	And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them Jehovah thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of Jehovah; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	21	6	And all the elders of that city, who are nearest unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	21	7	and they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	21	8	Forgive, O Jehovah, thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and suffer not innocent blood to remain in the midst of thy people Israel. And the blood shall be forgiven them.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	21	9	So shalt thou put away the innocent blood from the midst of thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	21	10	When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and Jehovah thy God delivereth them into thy hands, and thou carriest them away captive,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	21	11	and seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	21	12	then thou shalt bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	21	13	and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	21	14	And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not deal with her as a slave, because thou hast humbled her.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	21	15	If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the first-born son be hers that was hated;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	21	16	then it shall be, in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved the first-born before the son of the hated, who is the first-born:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	21	17	but he shall acknowledge the first-born, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath; for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the first-born is his.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	21	18	If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, that will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and, though they chasten him, will not hearken unto them;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	21	19	then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	21	20	and they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	21	21	And all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	21	22	And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	21	23	his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt surely bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is accursed of God; that thou defile not thy land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	1	Thou shalt not see thy brothers ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely bring them again unto thy brother.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	2	And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it home to thy house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	3	And so shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his garment; and so shalt thou do with every lost thing of thy brothers, which he hath lost, and thou hast found: thou mayest not hide thyself.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	4	Thou shalt not see thy brothers ass or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	5	A woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a womans garment; for whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto Jehovah thy God.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	6	If a birds nest chance to be before thee in the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	7	thou shalt surely let the dam go, but the young thou mayest take unto thyself; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	8	When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thy house, if any man fall from thence.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	9	Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest the whole fruit be forfeited, the seed which thou hast sown, and the increase of the vineyard.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	10	Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	11	Thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff, wool and linen together.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	12	Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four borders of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	13	If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	14	and lay shameful things to her charge, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came nigh to her, I found not in her the tokens of virginity;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	15	then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsels virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	16	and the damsels father shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	17	and, lo, he hath laid shameful things to her charge, saying, I found not in thy daughter the tokens of virginity; and yet these are the tokens of my daughters virginity. And they shall spread the garment before the elders of the city.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	18	And the elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	19	and they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	20	But if this thing be true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the damsel;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	21	then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her fathers house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones, because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the harlot in her fathers house: so shalt thou put away the evil from th	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	22	If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away the evil from Israel.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	23	If there be a damsel that is a virgin betrothed unto a husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	24	then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them to death with stones; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbors wife: so thou shalt put away the evil from	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	25	But if the man find the damsel that is betrothed in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her; then the man only that lay with her shall die:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	26	but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbor, and slayeth him, even so is this matter;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	27	for he found her in the field, the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	28	If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, that is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	29	then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsels father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife, because he hath humbled her; he may not put her away all his days.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	22	30	A man shall not take his fathers wife, and shall not uncover his fathers skirt.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	1	He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the assembly of Jehovah.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	2	A bastard shall not enter into the assembly of Jehovah; even to the tenth generation shall none of his enter into the assembly of Jehovah.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	3	An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of Jehovah; even to the tenth generation shall none belonging to them enter into the assembly of Jehovah for ever:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	4	because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt, and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	5	Nevertheless Jehovah thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but Jehovah thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because Jehovah thy God loved thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	6	Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	7	Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother: thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian, because thou wast a sojourner in his land.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	8	The children of the third generation that are born unto them shall enter into the assembly of Jehovah.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	9	When thou goest forth in camp against thine enemies, then thou shalt keep thee from every evil thing.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	10	If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of that which chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	11	but it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall bathe himself in water; and when the sun is down, he shall come within the camp.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	12	Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	13	and thou shalt have a paddle among thy weapons; and it shall be, when thou sittest down abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	14	for Jehovah thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy, that he may not see an unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	15	Thou shalt not deliver unto his master a servant that is escaped from his master unto thee:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	16	he shall dwell with thee, in the midst of thee, in the place which he shall choose within one of thy gates, where it pleaseth him best: thou shalt not oppress him.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	17	There shall be no prostitute of the daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	18	Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot, or the wages of a dog, into the house of Jehovah thy God for any vow: for even both these are an abomination unto Jehovah thy God.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	19	Thou shalt not lend upon interest to thy brother; interest of money, interest of victuals, interest of anything that is lent upon interest:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	20	unto a foreigner thou mayest lend upon interest; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon interest, that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in all that thou puttest thy hand unto, in the land whither thou goest in to possess it.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	21	When thou shalt vow a vow unto Jehovah thy God, thou shalt not be slack to pay it: for Jehovah thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	22	But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	23	That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt observe and do; according as thou hast vowed unto Jehovah thy God, a freewill-offering, which thou hast promised with thy mouth.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	24	When thou comest into thy neighbors vineyard, then thou mayest eat of grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	23	25	When thou comest into thy neighbors standing grain, then thou mayest pluck the ears with thy hand; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbors standing grain.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	24	1	When a man taketh a wife, and marrieth her, then it shall be, if she find no favor in his eyes, because he hath found some unseemly thing in her, that he shall write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	24	2	And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another mans wife.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	24	3	And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, who took her to be his wife;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	24	4	her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before Jehovah: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	24	5	When a man taketh a new wife, he shall not go out in the host, neither shall he be charged with any business: he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer his wife whom he hath taken.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	24	6	No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge; for he taketh a mans life to pledge.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	24	7	If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and he deal with him as a slave, or sell him; then that thief shall die: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	24	8	Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	24	9	Remember what Jehovah thy God did unto Miriam, by the way as ye came forth out of Egypt.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	24	10	When thou dost lend thy neighbor any manner of loan, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	24	11	Thou shalt stand without, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring forth the pledge without unto thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	24	12	And if he be a poor man, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	24	13	thou shalt surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before Jehovah thy God.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	24	14	Thou shalt not oppress a hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy sojourners that are in thy land within thy gates:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	24	15	in his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto Jehovah, and it be sin unto thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	24	16	The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	24	17	Thou shalt not wrest the justice due to the sojourner, or to the fatherless, nor take the widows raiment to pledge;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	24	18	but thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and Jehovah thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	24	19	When thou reapest thy harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow; that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hands.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	24	20	When thou beatest thine olive-tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	24	21	When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it after thee: it shall be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	24	22	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	25	1	If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, and the judges judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	25	2	and it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his wickedness, by number.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	25	3	Forty stripes he may give him, he shall not exceed; lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother should seem vile unto thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	25	4	Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the grain.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	25	5	If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no son, the wife of the dead shall not be married without unto a stranger: her husbands brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of a husbands brother unto he	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	25	6	And it shall be, that the first-born that she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother that is dead, that his name be not blotted out of Israel.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	25	7	And if the man like not to take his brothers wife, then his brothers wife shall go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husbands brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel; he will not perform the duty of a husbands brother unto	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	25	8	Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and if he stand, and say, I like not to take her;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	25	9	then shall his brothers wife come unto him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face; and she shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto the man that doth not build up his brothers house.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	25	10	And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe loosed.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	25	11	When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	25	12	then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall have no pity.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	25	13	Thou shalt not have in thy bag diverse weights, a great and a small.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	25	14	Thou shalt not have in thy house diverse measures, a great and a small.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	25	15	A perfect and just weight shalt thou have; a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be long in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	25	16	For all that do such things, even all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto Jehovah thy God.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	25	17	Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way as ye came forth out of Egypt;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	25	18	how he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	25	19	Therefore it shall be, when Jehovah thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	26	1	And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, and dwellest therein,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	26	2	that thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which thou shalt bring in from thy land that Jehovah thy God giveth thee; and thou shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, to cause his nam	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	26	3	And thou shalt come unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto Jehovah thy God, that I am come unto the land which Jehovah sware unto our fathers to give us.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	26	4	And the priest shall take the basket out of thy hand, and set it down before the altar of Jehovah thy God.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	26	5	And thou shalt answer and say before Jehovah thy God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father; and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there, few in number; and he became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	26	6	And the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	26	7	and we cried unto Jehovah, the God of our fathers, and Jehovah heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil, and our oppression;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	26	8	and Jehovah brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	26	9	and he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	26	10	And now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground, which thou, O Jehovah, hast given me. And thou shalt set it down before Jehovah thy God, and worship before Jehovah thy God:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	26	11	and thou shalt rejoice in all the good which Jehovah thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thy house, thou, and the Levite, and the sojourner that is in the midst of thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	26	12	When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithe of thine increase in the third year, which is the year of tithing, then thou shalt give it unto the Levite, to the sojourner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	26	13	And thou shalt say before Jehovah thy God, I have put away the hallowed things out of my house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the sojourner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandment which thou hast command	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	26	14	I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I put away thereof, being unclean, nor given thereof for the dead: I have hearkened to the voice of Jehovah my God; I have done according to all that thou hast commanded me.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	26	15	Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the ground which thou hast given us, as thou swarest unto our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	26	16	This day Jehovah thy God commandeth thee to do these statutes and ordinances: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	26	17	Thou hast avouched Jehovah this day to be thy God, and that thou wouldest walk in his ways, and keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his ordinances, and hearken unto his voice:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	26	18	and Jehovah hath avouched thee this day to be a people for his own possession, as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	26	19	and to make thee high above all nations that he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that thou mayest be a holy people unto Jehovah thy God, as he hath spoken.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	1	And Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandment which I command you this day.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	2	And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over the Jordan unto the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee up great stones, and plaster them with plaster:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	3	and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou art passed over; that thou mayest go in unto the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, as Jehovah, the God of thy fathers, hath promised thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	4	And it shall be, when ye are passed over the Jordan, that ye shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaster them with plaster.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	5	And there shalt thou build an altar unto Jehovah thy God, an altar of stones: thou shalt lift up no iron tool upon them.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	6	Thou shalt build the altar of Jehovah thy God of unhewn stones; and thou shalt offer burnt-offerings thereon unto Jehovah thy God:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	7	and thou shalt sacrifice peace-offerings, and shalt eat there; and thou shalt rejoice before Jehovah thy God.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	8	And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	9	And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel, saying, Keep silence, and hearken, O Israel: this day thou art become the people of Jehovah thy God.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	10	Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of Jehovah thy God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this day.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	11	And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	12	These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when ye are passed over the Jordan: Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	13	And these shall stand upon mount Ebal for the curse: Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	14	And the Levites shall answer, and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	15	Cursed be the man that maketh a graven or molten image, an abomination unto Jehovah, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and setteth it up in secret. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	16	Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	17	Cursed be he that removeth his neighbors landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	18	Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way. And all the people shall say, Amen.	5

ASV	Deuteronomy	27	20	Cursed be he that lieth with his fathers wife, because he hath uncovered his fathers skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	21	Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all the people shall say, Amen.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	22	Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	23	Cursed be he that lieth with his mother-in-law. And all the people shall say, Amen.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	24	Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbor in secret. And all the people shall say, Amen.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	25	Cursed be he that taketh a bribe to slay an innocent person. And all the people shall say, Amen.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	27	26	Cursed be he that confirmeth not the words of this law to do them. And all the people shall say, Amen.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	1	And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of Jehovah thy God, to observe to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that Jehovah thy God will set thee on high above all the nations of the earth:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	2	and all these blessings shall come upon thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	3	Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	4	Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy beasts, the increase of thy cattle, and the young of thy flock.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	5	Blessed shall be thy basket and thy kneading-trough.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	6	Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	7	Jehovah will cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thee: they shall come out against thee one way, and shall flee before thee seven ways.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	8	Jehovah will command the blessing upon thee in thy barns, and in all that thou puttest thy hand unto; and he will bless thee in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	9	Jehovah will establish thee for a holy people unto himself, as he hath sworn unto thee; if thou shalt keep the commandments of Jehovah thy God, and walk in his ways.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	10	And all the peoples of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of Jehovah; and they shall be afraid of thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	11	And Jehovah will make thee plenteous for good, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, in the land which Jehovah sware unto thy fathers to give thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	12	Jehovah will open unto thee his good treasure the heavens, to give the rain of thy land in its season, and to bless all the work of thy hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt not borrow.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	13	And Jehovah will make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if thou shalt hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah thy God, which I command thee this day, to observe and to do them,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	14	and shalt not turn aside from any of the words which I command you this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	15	But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day, that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	16	Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	17	Cursed shall be thy basket and thy kneading-trough.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	18	Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, the increase of thy cattle, and the young of thy flock.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	19	Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	20	Jehovah will send upon thee cursing, discomfiture, and rebuke, in all that thou puttest thy hand unto to do, until thou be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the evil of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	21	Jehovah will make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he have consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest in to possess it.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	22	Jehovah will smite thee with consumption, and with fever, and with inflammation, and with fiery heat, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	23	And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is under thee shall be iron.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	24	Jehovah will make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	25	Jehovah will cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies; thou shalt go out one way against them, and shalt flee seven ways before them: and thou shalt be tossed to and from among all the kingdoms of the earth.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	26	And thy dead body shall be food unto all birds of the heavens, and unto the beasts of the earth; and there shall be none to frighten them away.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	27	Jehovah will smite thee with the boil of Egypt, and with the emerods, and with the scurvy, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be healed.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	28	Jehovah will smite thee with madness, and with blindness, and with astonishment of heart;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	29	and thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only oppressed and robbed alway, and there shall be none to save thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	30	Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou shalt build a house, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not use the fruit thereof.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	31	Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof: thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to save thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	32	Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people; and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day: and there shall be nought in the power of thy hand.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	33	The fruit of thy ground, and all thy labors, shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	34	so that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	35	Jehovah will smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore boil, whereof thou canst not be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the crown of thy head.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	36	Jehovah will bring thee, and thy king whom thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation that thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	37	And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all the peoples whither Jehovah shall lead thee away.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	38	Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather little in; for the locust shall consume it.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	39	Thou shalt plant vineyards and dress them, but thou shalt neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worm shall eat them.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	40	Thou shalt have olive-trees throughout all thy borders, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast its fruit.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	41	Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but they shall not be thine; for they shall go into captivity.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	42	All thy trees and the fruit of thy ground shall the locust possess.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	43	The sojourner that is in the midst of thee shall mount up above thee higher and higher; and thou shalt come down lower and lower.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	44	He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	45	And all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	46	and they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	47	Because thou servedst not Jehovah thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	48	therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies that Jehovah shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	49	Jehovah will bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	50	a nation of fierce countenance, that shall not regard the person of the old, nor show favor to the young,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	51	and shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy ground, until thou be destroyed; that also shall not leave thee grain, new wine, or oil, the increase of thy cattle, or the young of thy flock, until they have caused thee to perish.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	52	And they shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fortified walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land; and they shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which Jehovah thy God hath given thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	53	And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, whom Jehovah thy God hath given thee, in the siege and in the distress wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	54	The man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children whom he hath remaining;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	55	so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat, because he hath nothing left him, in the siege and in the distress wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in all thy gates.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	56	The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	57	and toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children whom she shall bear; for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly, in the siege and in the distress wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	58	If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, JEHOVAH THY GOD;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	59	then Jehovah will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	60	And he will bring upon thee again all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	61	Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will Jehovah bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	62	And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou didst not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	63	And it shall come to pass, that, as Jehovah rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so Jehovah will rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest in to possess it.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	64	And Jehovah will scatter thee among all peoples, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers, even wood and stone.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	65	And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, and there shall be no rest for the sole of thy foot: but Jehovah will give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and pining of soul;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	66	and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear night and day, and shalt have no assurance of thy life.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	67	In the morning thou shalt say, Would it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would it were morning! for the fear of thy heart which thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	28	68	And Jehovah will bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I said unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall sell yourselves unto your enemies for bondmen and for bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	1	These are the words of the covenant which Jehovah commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	2	And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen all that Jehovah did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	3	the great trials which thine eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	4	but Jehovah hath not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	5	And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxed old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxed old upon thy foot.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	6	Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink; that ye may know that I am Jehovah your God.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	7	And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	8	and we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of the Manassites.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	9	Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	10	Ye stand this day all of you before Jehovah your God; your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, even all the men of Israel,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	11	your little ones, your wives, and thy sojourner that is in the midst of thy camps, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	12	that thou mayest enter into the covenant of Jehovah thy God, and into his oath, which Jehovah thy God maketh with thee this day;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	13	that he may establish thee this day unto himself for a people, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he spake unto thee, and as he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	14	Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	15	but with him that standeth here with us this day before Jehovah our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	16	(for ye know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which ye passed;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	17	and ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them);	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	18	lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from Jehovah our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	19	and it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, to destroy the moist with the dry.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	20	Jehovah will not pardon him, but then the anger of Jehovah and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book shall lie upon him, and Jehovah will blot out his name from under heaven.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	21	And Jehovah will set him apart unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the law.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	22	And the generation to come, your children that shall rise up after you, and the foreigner that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses wherewith Jehovah hath made it sick;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	23	and that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and a burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which Jehovah overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	24	even all the nations shall say, Wherefore hath Jehovah done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	25	Then men shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of Jehovah, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	26	and went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods that they knew not, and that he had not given unto them:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	27	therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curse that is written in this book;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	28	and Jehovah rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as at this day.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	29	29	The secret things belong unto Jehovah our God; but the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	30	1	And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither Jehovah thy God hath driven thee,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	30	2	and shalt return unto Jehovah thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	30	3	that then Jehovah thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the peoples, whither Jehovah thy God hath scattered thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	30	4	If any of thine outcasts be in the uttermost parts of heaven, from thence will Jehovah thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	30	5	and Jehovah thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	30	6	And Jehovah thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	30	7	And Jehovah thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, that persecuted thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	30	8	And thou shalt return and obey the voice of Jehovah, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	30	9	And Jehovah thy God will make thee plenteous in all the work of thy hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, for good: for Jehovah will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy father	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	30	10	if thou shalt obey the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law; if thou turn unto Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	30	11	For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not too hard for thee, neither is it far off.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	30	12	It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	30	13	Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	30	14	But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	30	15	See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	30	16	in that I command thee this day to love Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances, that thou mayest live and multiply, and that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in the land whither thou goest in t	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	30	17	But if thy heart turn away, and thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	30	18	I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish; ye shall not prolong your days in the land, whither thou passest over the Jordan to go in to possess it.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	30	19	I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse: therefore choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	30	20	to love Jehovah thy God, to obey his voice, and to cleave unto him; for he is thy life, and the length of thy days; that thou mayest dwell in the land which Jehovah sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	1	And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	2	And he said unto them, I am a hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: and Jehovah hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	3	Jehovah thy God, he will go over before thee; he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt dispossess them: and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as Jehovah hath spoken.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	4	And Jehovah will do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and unto their land; whom he destroyed.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	5	And Jehovah will deliver them up before you, and ye shall do unto them according unto all the commandment which I have commanded you.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	6	Be strong and of good courage, fear not, nor be affrighted at them: for Jehovah thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	7	And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of good courage: for thou shalt go with this people into the land which Jehovah hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	8	And Jehovah, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	9	And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and unto all the elders of Israel.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	10	And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	11	when all Israel is come to appear before Jehovah thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	12	Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and thy sojourner that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Jehovah your God, and observe to do all the words of this law;	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	13	and that their children, who have not known, may hear, and learn to fear Jehovah your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	14	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tent of meeting.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	15	And Jehovah appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud: and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	16	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and play the harlot after the strange gods of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made wi	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	17	Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come upon them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	18	And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	19	Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach thou it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	20	For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxed fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	21	And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are come upon them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they frame this day, befor	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	22	So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	23	And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	24	And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	25	that Moses commanded the Levites, that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, saying,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	31	26	Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	34	2	and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the hinder sea,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	34	3	and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm-trees, unto Zoar.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	34	4	And Jehovah said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	34	5	So Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of Jehovah.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	34	6	And he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	34	7	And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	34	8	And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were ended.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	34	9	And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as Jehovah commanded Moses.	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	34	10	And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom Jehovah knew face to face,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	34	11	in all the signs and the wonders, which Jehovah sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,	5
ASV	Deuteronomy	34	12	and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror, which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.	5
ASV	Joshua	1	1	Now it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of Jehovah, that Jehovah spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses minister, saying,	6
ASV	Joshua	1	2	Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.	6
ASV	Joshua	1	3	Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, to you have I given it, as I spake unto Moses.	6
ASV	Joshua	1	4	From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.	6
ASV	Joshua	1	5	There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee; I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.	6
ASV	Joshua	1	6	Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land which I sware unto their fathers to give them.	6
ASV	Joshua	1	7	Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest have good success whithersoever thou goest.	6
ASV	Joshua	1	8	This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate thereon day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good succ	6
ASV	Joshua	1	9	Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of good courage; be not affrighted, neither be thou dismayed: for Jehovah thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.	6
ASV	Joshua	1	10	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,	6
ASV	Joshua	1	11	Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which Jehovah your God giveth you to possess it.	6
ASV	Joshua	1	12	And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,	6
ASV	Joshua	1	13	Remember the word which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God giveth you rest, and will give you this land.	6
ASV	Joshua	1	14	Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall abide in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but ye shall pass over before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valor, and shall help them;	6
ASV	Joshua	1	15	until Jehovah have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which Jehovah your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you	6
ASV	Joshua	1	16	And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou hast commanded us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go.	6
ASV	Joshua	1	17	According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only Jehovah thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.	6
ASV	Joshua	1	18	Whosoever he be that shall rebel against thy commandment, and shall not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of good courage.	6
ASV	Joshua	2	1	And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men as spies secretly, saying, Go, view the land, and Jericho. And they went and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lay there.	6
ASV	Joshua	2	2	And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to-night of the children of Israel to search out the land.	6
ASV	Joshua	2	3	And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, that are entered into thy house; for they are come to search out all the land.	6
ASV	Joshua	2	4	And the woman took the two men, and hid them; and she said, Yea, the men came unto me, but I knew not whence they were:	6
ASV	Joshua	2	5	and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out; whither the men went I know not: pursue after them quickly; for ye will overtake them.	6
ASV	Joshua	2	6	But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.	6
ASV	Joshua	2	7	And the men pursued after them the way to the Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they that pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.	6
ASV	Joshua	2	8	And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;	6
ASV	Joshua	2	9	and she said unto the men, I know that Jehovah hath given you the land, and that the fear of you is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.	6
ASV	Joshua	2	10	For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Red Sea before you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, unto Sihon and to Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.	6
ASV	Joshua	2	11	And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you: for Jehovah your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath.	6
ASV	Joshua	2	12	Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by Jehovah, since I have dealt kindly with you, that ye also will deal kindly with my fathers house, and give me a true token;	6
ASV	Joshua	2	13	and that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death.	6
ASV	Joshua	2	14	And the men said unto her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business; and it shall be, when Jehovah giveth us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.	6
ASV	Joshua	2	15	Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the side of the wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.	6
ASV	Joshua	2	16	And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers light upon you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.	6
ASV	Joshua	2	17	And the men said unto her, We will be guiltless of this thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.	6
ASV	Joshua	2	18	Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt gather unto thee into the house thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy fathers household.	6
ASV	Joshua	2	19	And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.	6
ASV	Joshua	2	20	But if thou utter this our business, then we shall be guiltless of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.	6
ASV	Joshua	2	21	And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.	6
ASV	Joshua	2	22	And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.	6
ASV	Joshua	2	23	Then the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had befallen them.	6
ASV	Joshua	2	24	And they said unto Joshua, Truly Jehovah hath delivered into our hands all the land; and moreover all the inhabitants of the land do melt away before us.	6
ASV	Joshua	3	1	And Joshua rose up early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel; and they lodged there before they passed over.	6
ASV	Joshua	3	2	And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the midst of the camp;	6
ASV	Joshua	3	3	and they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.	6
ASV	Joshua	3	4	Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this way heretofore.	6
ASV	Joshua	3	5	And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow Jehovah will do wonders among you.	6
ASV	Joshua	3	6	And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.	6
ASV	Joshua	3	7	And Jehovah said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.	6
ASV	Joshua	3	8	And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, ye shall stand still in the Jordan.	6
ASV	Joshua	3	9	And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of Jehovah your God.	6
ASV	Joshua	3	10	And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite.	6
ASV	Joshua	3	11	Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into the Jordan.	6
ASV	Joshua	3	12	Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man.	6
ASV	Joshua	3	13	And it shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of Jehovah, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, even the waters that come down from above	6
ASV	Joshua	3	14	And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over the Jordan, the priests that bare the ark of the covenant being before the people;	6
ASV	Joshua	3	15	and when they that bare the ark were come unto the Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brink of the water (for the Jordan overfloweth all its banks all the time of harvest,)	6
ASV	Joshua	3	16	that the waters which came down from above stood, and rose up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off: and the people passed ove	6
ASV	Joshua	3	17	And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan; and all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation were passed clean over the Jordan.	6
ASV	Joshua	4	1	And it came to pass, when all the nation were clean passed over the Jordan, that Jehovah spake unto Joshua, saying,	6
ASV	Joshua	4	2	Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,	6
ASV	Joshua	4	3	and command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging-place, where ye shall lodge this night.	6
ASV	Joshua	4	4	Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:	6
ASV	Joshua	4	5	and Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of the Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel;	6
ASV	Joshua	4	6	that this may be a sign among you, that, when your children ask in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?	6
ASV	Joshua	4	7	then ye shall say unto them, Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; when it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Isra	6
ASV	Joshua	4	8	And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as Jehovah spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; and they carried them over with them unto the p	6
ASV	Joshua	4	9	And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests that bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.	6
ASV	Joshua	4	10	For the priests that bare the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until everything was finished that Jehovah commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.	6
ASV	Joshua	4	11	And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of Jehovah passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.	6
ASV	Joshua	4	12	And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:	6
ASV	Joshua	4	13	about forty thousand ready armed for war passed over before Jehovah unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.	6
ASV	Joshua	4	14	On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.	6
ASV	Joshua	4	15	And Jehovah spake unto Joshua, saying,	6
ASV	Joshua	4	16	Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.	6
ASV	Joshua	4	17	Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of the Jordan.	6
ASV	Joshua	4	18	And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah were come up out of the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests feet were lifted up unto the dry ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned unto their place,	6
ASV	Joshua	4	19	And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho.	6
ASV	Joshua	4	20	And those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, did Joshua set up in Gilgal.	6
ASV	Joshua	4	21	And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?	6
ASV	Joshua	4	22	Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.	6
ASV	Joshua	4	23	For Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as Jehovah your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were passed over;	6
ASV	Joshua	4	24	that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of Jehovah, that it is mighty; that ye may fear Jehovah your God for ever.	6
ASV	Joshua	5	1	And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, that were by the sea, heard how that Jehovah had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, unti	6
ASV	Joshua	5	2	At that time Jehovah said unto Joshua, Make thee knives of flint, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.	6
ASV	Joshua	5	3	And Joshua made him knives of lint, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.	6
ASV	Joshua	5	4	And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: all the people that came forth out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt.	6
ASV	Joshua	5	5	For all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, they had not circumcised.	6
ASV	Joshua	5	6	For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the nation, even the men of war that came forth out of Egypt, were consumed, because they hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah: unto whom Jehovah sware that he would not let them	6
ASV	Joshua	5	7	And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them did Joshua circumcise: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.	6
ASV	Joshua	5	8	And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the nation, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.	6
ASV	Joshua	5	9	And Jehovah said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of that place was called Gilgal, unto this day.	6
ASV	Joshua	5	10	And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal; and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.	6
ASV	Joshua	5	11	And they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched grain, in the selfsame day.	6
ASV	Joshua	5	12	And the manna ceased on the morrow, after they had eaten of the produce of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.	6
ASV	Joshua	5	13	And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?	6
ASV	Joshua	5	14	And he said, Nay; but as prince of the host of Jehovah am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?	6
ASV	Joshua	5	15	And the prince of Jehovahs host said unto Joshua, Put off thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.	6
ASV	Joshua	6	1	Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.	6
ASV	Joshua	6	2	And Jehovah said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thy hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valor.	6
ASV	Joshua	6	3	And ye shall compass the city, all the men of war, going about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.	6
ASV	Joshua	6	4	And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams horns before the ark: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.	6
ASV	Joshua	6	5	And it shall be, that, when they make a long blast with the rams horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight b	6
ASV	Joshua	6	6	And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams horns before the ark of Jehovah.	6
ASV	Joshua	6	7	And they said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of Jehovah.	6
ASV	Joshua	6	8	And it was so, that, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams horns before Jehovah passed on, and blew the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah followed them.	6
ASV	Joshua	6	9	And the armed men went before the priests that blew the trumpets, and the rearward went after the ark, the priests blowing the trumpets as they went.	6
ASV	Joshua	6	10	And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.	6
ASV	Joshua	6	11	So he caused the ark of Jehovah to compass the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.	6
ASV	Joshua	6	12	And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Jehovah.	6
ASV	Joshua	6	13	And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams horns before the ark of Jehovah went on continually, and blew the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; and the rearward came after the ark of Jehovah, the priests blowing the trumpets as th	6
ASV	Joshua	6	14	And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.	6
ASV	Joshua	6	15	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on the day they compassed the city seven times.	6
ASV	Joshua	6	16	And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for Jehovah hath given you the city.	6
ASV	Joshua	6	17	And the city shall be devoted, even it and all that is therein, to Jehovah: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.	6
ASV	Joshua	6	18	But as for you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing, lest when ye have devoted it, ye take of the devoted thing; so would ye make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.	6
ASV	Joshua	6	19	But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy unto Jehovah: they shall come into the treasury of Jehovah.	6
ASV	Joshua	6	20	So the people shouted, and the priests blew the trumpets; and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man str	6
ASV	Joshua	6	21	And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.	6
ASV	Joshua	6	22	And Joshua said unto the two men that had spied out the land, Go into the harlots house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.	6
ASV	Joshua	6	23	And the young men the spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; all her kindred also they brought out; and they set them without the camp of Israel.	6
ASV	Joshua	6	24	And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein; only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah.	6
ASV	Joshua	6	25	But Rahab the harlot, and her fathers household, and all that she had, did Joshua save alive; and she dwelt in the midst of Israel unto this day, because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.	6
ASV	Joshua	6	26	And Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before Jehovah, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: with the loss of his first-born shall he lay the foundation thereof, and with the loss of his youngest son shall he	6
ASV	Joshua	6	27	So Jehovah was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.	6
ASV	Joshua	7	1	But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted thing; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the children of Israel.	6
ASV	Joshua	7	2	And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. And the men went up and spied out Ai.	6
ASV	Joshua	7	3	And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; make not all the people to toil thither; for they are but few.	6
ASV	Joshua	7	4	So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.	6
ASV	Joshua	7	5	And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men; and they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them at the descent; and the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.	6
ASV	Joshua	7	6	And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of Jehovah until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust upon their heads.	6
ASV	Joshua	7	7	And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? would that we had been content and dwelt beyond the Jordan!	6
ASV	Joshua	7	8	Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel hath turned their backs before their enemies!	6
ASV	Joshua	7	9	For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will compass us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do for thy great name?	6
ASV	Joshua	7	10	And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore art thou thus fallen upon thy face?	6
ASV	Joshua	7	11	Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: yea, they have even taken of the devoted thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also; and they have even put it among their own stuff.	6
ASV	Joshua	7	12	Therefore the children of Israel cannot stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, because they are become accursed: I will not be with you any more, except ye destroy the devoted thing from among you.	6
ASV	Joshua	7	13	Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow: for thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, There is a devoted thing in the midst of thee, O Israel; thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the devoted thing fro	6
ASV	Joshua	7	14	In the morning therefore ye shall be brought near by your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which Jehovah taketh shall come near by families; and the family which Jehovah shall take shall come near by households; and the household which Jehovah shal	6
ASV	Joshua	7	15	And it shall be, that he that is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath; because he hath transgressed the covenant of Jehovah, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.	6
ASV	Joshua	7	16	So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:	6
ASV	Joshua	7	17	and he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zerahites: and he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:	6
ASV	Joshua	7	18	and he brought near his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.	6
ASV	Joshua	7	19	And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to Jehovah, the God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.	6
ASV	Joshua	7	20	And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned against Jehovah, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:	6
ASV	Joshua	7	21	when I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonish mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under	6
ASV	Joshua	7	22	So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.	6
ASV	Joshua	7	23	And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel; and they laid them down before Jehovah.	6
ASV	Joshua	7	24	And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them	6
ASV	Joshua	7	25	And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? Jehovah shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.	6
ASV	Joshua	7	26	And they raised over him a great heap of stones, unto this day; and Jehovah turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	1	And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land;	6
ASV	Joshua	8	2	And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: set thee an ambush for the city behind it.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	3	So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor, and sent them forth by night.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	4	And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city; go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:	6
ASV	Joshua	8	5	and I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city. And it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them;	6
ASV	Joshua	8	6	and they will come out after us, till we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: so we will flee before them;	6
ASV	Joshua	8	7	and ye shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city: for Jehovah your God will deliver it into your hand.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	8	And it shall be, when ye have seized upon the city, that ye shall set the city on fire; according to the word of Jehovah shall ye do: see, I have commanded you.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	9	And Joshua sent them forth; and they went to the ambushment, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	10	And Joshua arose up early in the morning, and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	11	And all the people, even the men of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between him and Ai.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	12	And he took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	13	So they set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers-in-wait that were on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	14	And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah; but he knew not that there was an ambush again	6
ASV	Joshua	8	15	And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	16	And all the people that were in the city were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	17	And there was not a man left in Ai or Beth-el, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	18	And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thy hand. And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	19	And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it; and they hasted and set the city on fire.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	20	And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	21	And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	22	And the others came forth out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	23	And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	24	And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned unto Ai,	6
ASV	Joshua	8	25	And all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	26	For Joshua drew not back his hand, wherewith he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	27	Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey unto themselves, according unto the word of Jehovah which he commanded Joshua.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	28	So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap for ever, even a desolation, unto this day.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	29	And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the eventide: and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised thereon a great heap of stones, unto t	6
ASV	Joshua	8	30	Then Joshua built an altar unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, in mount Ebal,	6
ASV	Joshua	8	31	as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of unhewn stones, upon which no man had lifted up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt-offerings unto Jehovah, and sacrificed	6
ASV	Joshua	8	32	And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote, in the presence of the children of Israel.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	33	And all Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, as well the sojourner as the homeborn; half of them in front of m	6
ASV	Joshua	8	34	And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law.	6
ASV	Joshua	8	35	There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners that were among them.	6
ASV	Joshua	9	1	And it came to pass, when all the kings that were beyond the Jordan, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusi	6
ASV	Joshua	9	2	that they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.	6
ASV	Joshua	9	3	But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,	6
ASV	Joshua	9	4	they also did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine-skins, old and rent and bound up,	6
ASV	Joshua	9	5	and old and patched shoes upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and was become mouldy.	6
ASV	Joshua	9	6	And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We are come from a far country: now therefore make ye a covenant with us.	6
ASV	Joshua	9	7	And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a covenant with you?	6
ASV	Joshua	9	8	And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?	6
ASV	Joshua	9	9	And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of Jehovah thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,	6
ASV	Joshua	9	10	and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.	6
ASV	Joshua	9	11	And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take provision in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: and now make ye a covenant with us.	6
ASV	Joshua	9	12	This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and is become mouldy:	6
ASV	Joshua	9	13	and these wine-skins, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they are rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.	6
ASV	Joshua	9	14	And the men took of their provision, and asked not counsel at the mouth of Jehovah.	6
ASV	Joshua	9	15	And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.	6
ASV	Joshua	9	16	And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelt among them.	6
ASV	Joshua	9	17	And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.	6
ASV	Joshua	9	18	And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by Jehovah, the God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.	6
ASV	Joshua	9	19	But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by Jehovah, the God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.	6
ASV	Joshua	9	20	This we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.	6
ASV	Joshua	9	21	And the princes said unto them, Let them live: so they became hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation, as the princes had spoken unto them.	6
ASV	Joshua	9	22	And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?	6
ASV	Joshua	9	23	Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall never fail to be of you bondmen, both hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.	6
ASV	Joshua	9	24	And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that Jehovah thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; therefore we were sore afraid fo	6
ASV	Joshua	9	25	And now, behold, we are in thy hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.	6
ASV	Joshua	9	26	And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.	6
ASV	Joshua	9	27	And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of Jehovah, unto this day, in the place which he should choose.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	1	Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, a	6
ASV	Joshua	10	2	that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	3	Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,	6
ASV	Joshua	10	4	Come up unto me, and help me, and let us smite Gibeon; for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	5	Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped against Gibeon, and made wa	6
ASV	Joshua	10	6	And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill-country are gathered together against us.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	7	So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	8	And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thy hands; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	9	Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly; for he went up from Gilgal all the night.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	10	And Jehovah discomfited them before Israel, and he slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	11	And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, that Jehovah cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the childr	6
ASV	Joshua	10	12	Then spake Joshua to Jehovah in the day when Jehovah delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; And thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	13	And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, Until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	14	And there was no day like that before it or after it, that Jehovah hearkened unto the voice of a man: for Jehovah fought for Israel.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	15	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	16	And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	17	And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	18	And Joshua said, Roll great stones unto the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to keep them:	6
ASV	Joshua	10	19	but stay not ye; pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for Jehovah your God hath delivered them into your hand.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	20	And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,	6
ASV	Joshua	10	21	that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	22	Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth those five kings unto me out of the cave.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	23	And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	24	And it came to pass, when they brought forth those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the chiefs of the men of war that went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near,	6
ASV	Joshua	10	25	And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage: for thus shall Jehovah do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	26	And afterward Joshua smote them, and put them to death, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	27	And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, unto this very day.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	28	And Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof: he utterly destroyed them and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done unto the king of	6
ASV	Joshua	10	29	And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:	6
ASV	Joshua	10	30	and Jehovah delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining in it; and he did unto the king thereof as he had done unto the king of J	6
ASV	Joshua	10	31	And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:	6
ASV	Joshua	10	32	and Jehovah delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel; and he took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	33	Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	34	And Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, unto Eglon; and they encamped against it, and fought against it;	6
ASV	Joshua	10	35	and they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword; and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	36	And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:	6
ASV	Joshua	10	37	and they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the	6
ASV	Joshua	10	38	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it:	6
ASV	Joshua	10	39	and he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king	6
ASV	Joshua	10	40	So Joshua smote all the land, the hill-country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, commanded.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	41	And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	42	And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because Jehovah, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.	6
ASV	Joshua	10	43	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.	6
ASV	Joshua	11	1	And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor heard thereof, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,	6
ASV	Joshua	11	2	and to the kings that were on the north, in the hill-country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west,	6
ASV	Joshua	11	3	to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the hill-country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.	6
ASV	Joshua	11	4	And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea-shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.	6
ASV	Joshua	11	5	And all these kings met together; and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.	6
ASV	Joshua	11	6	And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them; for to-morrow at this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hock their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.	6
ASV	Joshua	11	7	So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell upon them.	6
ASV	Joshua	11	8	And Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they smote them, and chased them unto great Sidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.	6
ASV	Joshua	11	9	And Joshua did unto them as Jehovah bade him: he hocked their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.	6
ASV	Joshua	11	10	And Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.	6
ASV	Joshua	11	11	And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them; there was none left that breathed: and he burnt Hazor with fire.	6
ASV	Joshua	11	12	And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and he smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded.	6
ASV	Joshua	11	13	But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.	6
ASV	Joshua	11	14	And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any that breathed.	6
ASV	Joshua	11	15	As Jehovah commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua: and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that Jehovah commanded Moses.	6
ASV	Joshua	11	16	So Joshua took all that land, the hill-country, and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland, and the Arabah, and the hill-country of Israel, and the lowland of the same;	6
ASV	Joshua	11	17	from mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and put them to death.	6
ASV	Joshua	11	18	Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.	6
ASV	Joshua	11	19	There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: they took all in battle.	6
ASV	Joshua	11	20	For it was of Jehovah to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy them, that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as Jehovah commanded Moses.	6
ASV	Joshua	11	21	And Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill-country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill-country of Judah, and from all the hill-country of Israel: Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.	6
ASV	Joshua	11	22	There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain.	6
ASV	Joshua	11	23	So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Jehovah spake unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land had rest from war.	6
ASV	Joshua	12	1	Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising, from the valley of the Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the Arabah eastward:	6
ASV	Joshua	12	2	Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;	6
ASV	Joshua	12	3	and the Arabah unto the sea of Chinneroth, eastward, and unto the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward, the way to Beth-jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah:	6
ASV	Joshua	12	4	and the border of Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim, who dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,	6
ASV	Joshua	12	5	and ruled in mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.	6
ASV	Joshua	12	6	Moses the servant of Jehovah and the children of Israel smote them: and Moses the servant of Jehovah gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.	6
ASV	Joshua	12	7	And these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children of Israel smote beyond the Jordan westward, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even unto mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir; and Joshua gave it unto the tribes of Israel for a possession	6
ASV	Joshua	12	8	in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the Arabah, and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South; the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:	6
ASV	Joshua	12	9	the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;	6
ASV	Joshua	12	10	the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;	6
ASV	Joshua	12	11	the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;	6
ASV	Joshua	12	12	the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;	6
ASV	Joshua	12	13	the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;	6
ASV	Joshua	12	14	the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;	6
ASV	Joshua	12	15	the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;	6
ASV	Joshua	12	16	the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;	6
ASV	Joshua	12	17	the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;	6
ASV	Joshua	12	18	the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lassharon, one;	6
ASV	Joshua	12	19	the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;	6
ASV	Joshua	12	20	the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;	6
ASV	Joshua	12	21	the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;	6
ASV	Joshua	12	22	the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;	6
ASV	Joshua	12	23	the king of Dor in the height of Dor, one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one;	6
ASV	Joshua	12	24	the king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one.	6
ASV	Joshua	13	1	Now Joshua was old and well stricken in years; and Jehovah said unto him, Thou art old and well stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.	6
ASV	Joshua	13	2	This is the land that yet remaineth: all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites;	6
ASV	Joshua	13	3	from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the border of Ekron northward, which is reckoned to the Canaanites; the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avvim,	6
ASV	Joshua	13	4	on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongeth to the Sidonians, unto Aphek, to the border of the Amorites;	6
ASV	Joshua	13	5	and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baal-gad under mount Hermon unto the entrance of Hamath;	6
ASV	Joshua	13	6	all the inhabitants of the hill-country from Lebanon unto Misrephoth-maim, even all the Sidonians; them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only allot thou it unto Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.	6
ASV	Joshua	13	7	Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.	6
ASV	Joshua	13	8	With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of Jehovah gave them:	6
ASV	Joshua	13	9	from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon;	6
ASV	Joshua	13	10	and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;	6
ASV	Joshua	13	11	and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salecah;	6
ASV	Joshua	13	12	all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (the same was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); for these did Moses smite, and drove them out.	6
ASV	Joshua	13	13	Nevertheless the children of Israel drove not out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites: but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel unto this day.	6
ASV	Joshua	13	14	Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance; the offerings of Jehovah, the God of Israel, made by fire are his inheritance, as he spake unto him.	6
ASV	Joshua	13	15	And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their families.	6
ASV	Joshua	13	16	And their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba;	6
ASV	Joshua	13	17	Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon,	6
ASV	Joshua	13	18	and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,	6
ASV	Joshua	13	19	and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth-shahar in the mount of the valley,	6
ASV	Joshua	13	20	and Beth-peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth,	6
ASV	Joshua	13	21	and all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the princes of Sihon, that dwelt in the land.	6
ASV	Joshua	13	22	Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among the rest of their slain.	6
ASV	Joshua	13	23	And the border of the children of Reuben was the Jordan, and the border thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families, the cities and the villages thereof.	6
ASV	Joshua	13	24	And Moses gave unto the tribe of Gad, unto the children of Gad, according to their families.	6
ASV	Joshua	13	25	And their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah;	6
ASV	Joshua	13	26	and from Heshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;	6
ASV	Joshua	13	27	and in the valley, Beth-haram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, the Jordan and the border thereof, unto the uttermost part of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward.	6
ASV	Joshua	13	28	This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families, the cities and the villages thereof.	6
ASV	Joshua	13	29	And Moses gave inheritance unto the half-tribe of Manasseh: and it was for the half-tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families.	6
ASV	Joshua	13	30	And their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities:	6
ASV	Joshua	13	31	and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children of Machir according to their families.	6
ASV	Joshua	13	32	These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho, eastward.	6
ASV	Joshua	13	33	But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance: Jehovah, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as he spake unto them.	6
ASV	Joshua	14	1	And these are the inheritances which the children of Israel took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed unto them,	6
ASV	Joshua	14	2	by the lot of their inheritance, as Jehovah commanded by Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.	6
ASV	Joshua	14	3	For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.	6
ASV	Joshua	14	4	For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: and they gave no portion unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for their cattle and for their substance.	6
ASV	Joshua	14	5	As Jehovah commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did; and they divided the land.	6
ASV	Joshua	14	6	Then the children of Judah drew nigh unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that Jehovah spake unto Moses the man of God concerning me and concerning thee in Kadesh-barnea.	6
ASV	Joshua	14	7	Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in my heart.	6
ASV	Joshua	14	8	Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed Jehovah my God.	6
ASV	Joshua	14	9	And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy foot hath trodden shall be an inheritance to thee and to thy children for ever, because thou hast wholly followed Jehovah my God.	6
ASV	Joshua	14	10	And now, behold, Jehovah hath kept me alive, as he spake, these forty and five years, from the time that Jehovah spake this word unto Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.	6
ASV	Joshua	14	11	As yet I am as strong this day as I as in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, and to go out and to come in.	6
ASV	Joshua	14	12	Now therefore give me this hill-country, whereof Jehovah spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakim were there, and cities great and fortified: it may be that Jehovah will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as Jehovah spake.	6
ASV	Joshua	14	13	And Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.	6
ASV	Joshua	14	14	Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite unto this day; because that he wholly followed Jehovah, the God of Israel.	6
ASV	Joshua	14	15	Now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiriath-arba; which Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim. And the land had rest from war.	6
ASV	Joshua	15	1	And the lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families was unto the border of Edom, even to the wilderness of Zin southward, at the uttermost part of the south.	6
ASV	Joshua	15	2	And their south border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea, from the bay that looketh southward;	6
ASV	Joshua	15	3	and it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and went up by the south of Kadesh-barnea, and passed along by Hezron, and went up to Addar, and turned about to Karka;	6
ASV	Joshua	15	4	and it passed along to Azmon, and went out at the brook of Egypt; and the goings out of the border were at the sea: this shall be your south border.	6
ASV	Joshua	15	5	And the east border was the Salt Sea, even unto the end of the Jordan. And the border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan;	6
ASV	Joshua	15	6	and the border went up to Beth-hoglah, and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben;	6
ASV	Joshua	15	7	and the border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is over against the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the river; and the border passed along to the waters of En-shemesh, and the goings	6
ASV	Joshua	15	8	and the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the side of the Jebusite southward (the same is Jerusalem); and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the uttermost part of	6
ASV	Joshua	15	9	and the border extended from the top of the mountain unto the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border extended to Baalah (the same is Kiriath-jearim);	6
ASV	Joshua	15	10	and the border turned about from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim on the north (the same is Chesalon), and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed along by Timnah;	6
ASV	Joshua	15	11	and the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward; and the border extended to Shikkeron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out at Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.	6
ASV	Joshua	15	12	And the west border was to the great sea, and the border thereof. This is the border of the children of Judah round about according to their families.	6
ASV	Joshua	15	13	And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of Jehovah to Joshua, even Kiriath-arba, which Arba was the father of Anak (the same is Hebron).	6
ASV	Joshua	15	14	And Caleb drove out thence the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.	6
ASV	Joshua	15	15	And he went up thence against the inhabitants of Debir: now the name of Debir beforetime was Kiriath-sepher.	6
ASV	Joshua	15	16	And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.	6
ASV	Joshua	15	17	And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.	6
ASV	Joshua	15	18	And it came to pass, when she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she alighted from off her ass; and Caleb said, What wouldest thou?	6
ASV	Joshua	15	19	And she said, Give me a blessing; for that thou hast set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.	6
ASV	Joshua	15	20	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.	6
ASV	Joshua	15	21	And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom in the South were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,	6
ASV	Joshua	15	22	and Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,	6
ASV	Joshua	15	23	and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,	6
ASV	Joshua	15	24	Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,	6
ASV	Joshua	15	25	and Hazor-hadattah, and Kerioth-hezron (the same is Hazor),	6
ASV	Joshua	15	26	Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,	6
ASV	Joshua	15	27	and Hazar-gaddah, and Heshmon, and Beth-pelet,	6
ASV	Joshua	15	28	and Hazar-shual, and Beer-sheba, and Biziothiah,	6

ASV	Joshua	15	31	and Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,	6
ASV	Joshua	15	32	and Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities are twenty and nine, with their villages.	6
ASV	Joshua	15	33	In the lowland, Eshtaol, and Zorah, and Ashnah,	6
ASV	Joshua	15	34	and Zanoah, and En-gannim, Tappuah, and Enam,	6

ASV	Joshua	15	36	and Shaaraim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages.	6

ASV	Joshua	15	44	and Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages.	6
ASV	Joshua	15	45	Ekron, with its towns and its villages;	6
ASV	Joshua	15	46	from Ekron even unto the sea, all that were by the side of Ashdod, with their villages.	6
ASV	Joshua	15	47	Ashdod, its towns and its villages; Gaza, its towns and its villages; unto the brook of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border thereof.	6
ASV	Joshua	15	48	And in the hill-country, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,	6
ASV	Joshua	15	49	and Dannah, and Kiriath-sannah (the same is Debir),	6
ASV	Joshua	15	50	and Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,	6
ASV	Joshua	15	51	and Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages.	6

ASV	Joshua	15	59	and Maarath, and Beth-anoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their villages.	6
ASV	Joshua	15	60	Kiriath-baal (the same is Kiriath-jearim), and Rabbah; two cities with their villages.	6
ASV	Joshua	15	61	In the wilderness, Beth-arabah, Middin, and Secacah,	6
ASV	Joshua	15	62	and Nibshan, and the City of Salt, and En-gedi; six cities with their villages.	6
ASV	Joshua	15	63	And as for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out: but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.	6
ASV	Joshua	16	1	And the lot came out for the children of Joseph from the Jordan at Jericho, at the waters of Jericho on the east, even the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill-country to Beth-el;	6
ASV	Joshua	16	2	and it went out from Beth-el to Luz, and passed along unto the border of the Archites to Ataroth;	6
ASV	Joshua	16	3	and it went down westward to the border of the Japhletites, unto the border of Beth-horon the nether, even unto Gezer; and the goings out thereof were at the sea.	6
ASV	Joshua	16	4	And the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.	6
ASV	Joshua	16	5	And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus: the border of their inheritance eastward was Ataroth-addar, unto Beth-horon the upper;	6
ASV	Joshua	16	6	and the border went out westward at Michmethath on the north; and the border turned about eastward unto Taanath-shiloh, and passed along it on the east of Janoah;	6
ASV	Joshua	16	7	and it went down from Janoah to Ataroth, and to Naarah, and reached unto Jericho, and went out at the Jordan.	6
ASV	Joshua	16	8	From Tappuah the border went along westward to the brook of Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their families;	6
ASV	Joshua	16	9	together with the cities which were set apart for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.	6
ASV	Joshua	16	10	And they drove not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell in the midst of Ephraim unto this day, and are become servants to do taskwork.	6
ASV	Joshua	17	1	And this was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the first-born of Joseph. As for Machir the first-born of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.	6
ASV	Joshua	17	2	So the lot was for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families: for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the c	6
ASV	Joshua	17	3	But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.	6
ASV	Joshua	17	4	And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, Jehovah commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren: therefore according to the commandment of Jehovah he gave them an inherit	6
ASV	Joshua	17	5	And there fell ten parts to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan;	6
ASV	Joshua	17	6	because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead belonged unto the rest of the sons of Manasseh.	6
ASV	Joshua	17	7	And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is before Shechem; and the border went along to the right hand, unto the inhabitants of En-tappuah.	6
ASV	Joshua	17	8	The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim.	6
ASV	Joshua	17	9	And the border went down unto the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook: these cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh: and the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook, and the goings out thereof were at the sea:	6
ASV	Joshua	17	10	southward it was Ephraims, and northward it was Manassehs, and the sea was his border; and they reached to Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the east.	6
ASV	Joshua	17	11	And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megid	6
ASV	Joshua	17	12	Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.	6
ASV	Joshua	17	13	And it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxed strong, that they put the Canaanites to taskwork, and did not utterly drive them out.	6
ASV	Joshua	17	14	And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as hitherto Jehovah hath blessed me?	6
ASV	Joshua	17	15	And Joshua said unto them, If thou be a great people, get thee up to the forest, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill-country of Ephraim is too narrow for thee.	6
ASV	Joshua	17	16	And the children of Joseph said, The hill-country is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are in Beth-shean and its towns, and they who are in the valley of Jezreel.	6
ASV	Joshua	17	17	And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power; thou shalt not have one lot only:	6
ASV	Joshua	17	18	but the hill-country shall be thine; for though it is a forest, thou shalt cut it down, and the goings out thereof shall be thine; for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong.	6
ASV	Joshua	18	1	And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there: and the land was subdued before them.	6
ASV	Joshua	18	2	And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet divided their inheritance.	6
ASV	Joshua	18	3	And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye slack to go in to possess the land, which Jehovah, the God of your fathers, hath given you?	6
ASV	Joshua	18	4	Appoint for you three men of each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall arise, and walk through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance; and they shall come unto me.	6
ASV	Joshua	18	5	And they shall divide it into seven portions: Judah shall abide in his border on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their border on the north.	6
ASV	Joshua	18	6	And ye shall describe the land into seven portions, and bring the description hither to me; and I will cast lots for you here before Jehovah our God.	6
ASV	Joshua	18	7	For the Levites have no portion among you; for the priesthood of Jehovah is their inheritance: and Gad and Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave them.	6
ASV	Joshua	18	8	And the men arose, and went: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me; and I will cast lots for you here before Jehovah in Shiloh.	6
ASV	Joshua	18	9	And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven portions in a book; and they came to Joshua unto the camp at Shiloh.	6
ASV	Joshua	18	10	And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Jehovah: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions.	6
ASV	Joshua	18	11	And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.	6
ASV	Joshua	18	12	And their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill-country westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Beth-aven.	6
ASV	Joshua	18	13	And the border passed along from thence to Luz, to the side of Luz (the same is Beth-el), southward; and the border went down to Ataroth-addar, by the mountain that lieth on the south of Beth-horon the nether.	6
ASV	Joshua	18	14	And the border extended thence, and turned about on the west quarter southward, from the mountain that lieth before Beth-horon southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kiriath-baal (the same is Kiriath-jearim), a city of the children of Judah: this w	6
ASV	Joshua	18	15	And the south quarter was from the uttermost part of Kiriath-jearim; and the border went out westward, and went out to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah;	6
ASV	Joshua	18	16	and the border went down to the uttermost part of the mountain that lieth before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the vale of Rephaim northward; and it went down to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward, and went down to	6
ASV	Joshua	18	17	and it extended northward, and went out at En-shemesh, and went out to Geliloth, which is over against the ascent of Adummim; and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben;	6
ASV	Joshua	18	18	and it passed along to the side over against the Arabah northward, and went down unto the Arabah;	6
ASV	Joshua	18	19	and the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward; and the goings out of the border were at the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan: this was the south border.	6
ASV	Joshua	18	20	And the Jordan was the border of it on the east quarter. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the borders thereof round about, according to their families.	6
ASV	Joshua	18	21	Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and Emek-keziz,	6
ASV	Joshua	18	22	and Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Beth-el,	6
ASV	Joshua	18	23	and Avvim, and Parah, and Ophrah,	6
ASV	Joshua	18	24	and Chephar-ammoni, and Ophni, and Geba; twelve cities with their villages:	6
ASV	Joshua	18	25	Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,	6
ASV	Joshua	18	26	and Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,	6
ASV	Joshua	18	27	and Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,	6
ASV	Joshua	18	28	and Zelah, Eleph, and the Jebusite (the same is Jerusalem), Gibeath, and Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families.	6
ASV	Joshua	19	1	And the second lot came out for Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Judah.	6
ASV	Joshua	19	2	And they had for their inheritance Beer-sheba, or Sheba, and Moladah,	6
ASV	Joshua	19	3	and Hazar-shual, and Balah, and Ezem,	6

ASV	Joshua	19	7	Ain, Rimmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities with their villages:	6
ASV	Joshua	19	8	and all the villages that were round about these cities to Baalath-beer, Ramah of the South. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families.	6
ASV	Joshua	19	9	Out of the part of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon; for the portion of the children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance.	6
ASV	Joshua	19	10	And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families; and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid;	6
ASV	Joshua	19	11	and their border went up westward, even to Maralah, and reached to Dabbesheth; and it reached to the brook that is before Jokneam;	6
ASV	Joshua	19	12	and it turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of Chisloth-tabor; and it went out to Daberath, and went up to Japhia;	6

ASV	Joshua	19	22	and the border reached to Tabor, and Shahazumah, and Beth-shemesh; and the goings out of their border were at the Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.	6
ASV	Joshua	19	23	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities with their villages.	6
ASV	Joshua	19	24	And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families.	6
ASV	Joshua	19	25	And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,	6

ASV	Joshua	19	28	and Ebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even unto great Sidon;	6
ASV	Joshua	19	29	and the border turned to Ramah, and to the fortified city of Tyre; and the border turned to Hosah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea by the region of Achzib;	6
ASV	Joshua	19	30	Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their villages.	6
ASV	Joshua	19	31	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.	6
ASV	Joshua	19	32	The sixth lot came out for the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their families.	6
ASV	Joshua	19	33	And their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim, and Adaminekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakkum; and the goings out thereof were at the Jordan;	6
ASV	Joshua	19	34	and the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor, and went out from thence to Hukkok; and it reached to Zebulun on the south, and reached to Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan toward the sunrising.	6

ASV	Joshua	19	45	and Jehud, and Bene-berak, and Gath-rimmon,	6
ASV	Joshua	19	46	and Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border over against Joppa.	6
ASV	Joshua	19	47	And the border of the children of Dan went out beyond them; for the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan	6
ASV	Joshua	19	48	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.	6
ASV	Joshua	19	49	So they made an end of distributing the land for inheritance by the borders thereof; and the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in the midst of them:	6
ASV	Joshua	19	50	according to the commandment of Jehovah they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnath-serah in the hill-country of Ephraim; and he built the city, and dwelt therein.	6
ASV	Joshua	19	51	These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting.	6
ASV	Joshua	20	1	And Jehovah spake unto Joshua, saying,	6
ASV	Joshua	20	2	Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Assign you the cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by Moses,	6
ASV	Joshua	20	3	that the manslayer that killeth any person unwittingly and unawares may flee thither: and they shall be unto you for a refuge from the avenger of blood.	6
ASV	Joshua	20	4	And he shall flee unto one of those cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city; and they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell amo	6
ASV	Joshua	20	5	And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver up the manslayer into his hand; because he smote his neighbor unawares, and hated him not beforetime.	6
ASV	Joshua	20	6	And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days: then shall the manslayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from w	6
ASV	Joshua	20	7	And they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill-country of Naphtali, and Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron) in the hill-country of Judah.	6
ASV	Joshua	20	8	And beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.	6
ASV	Joshua	20	9	These were the appointed cities for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth any person unwittingly might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the c	6
ASV	Joshua	21	1	Then came near the heads of fathers houses of the Levites unto Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of fathers houses of the tribes of the children of Israel;	6
ASV	Joshua	21	2	and they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, Jehovah commanded Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	3	And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance, according to the commandment of Jehovah, these cities with their suburbs.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	4	And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of the Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	5	And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	6	And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	7	The children of Merari according to their families had out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	8	And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as Jehovah commanded by Moses.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	9	And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here mentioned by name:	6
ASV	Joshua	21	10	and they were for the children of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi; for theirs was the first lot.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	11	And they gave them Kiriath-arba, which Arba was the father of Anak (the same is Hebron), in the hill-country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof round about it.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	12	But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	13	And unto the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Libnah with its suburbs,	6
ASV	Joshua	21	14	and Jattir with its suburbs, and Eshtemoa with its suburbs,	6
ASV	Joshua	21	15	and Holon with its suburbs, and Debir with its suburbs,	6
ASV	Joshua	21	16	and Ain with its suburbs, and Juttah with its suburbs, and Beth-shemesh with its suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	17	And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its suburbs, Geba with its suburbs,	6
ASV	Joshua	21	18	Anathoth with its suburbs, and Almon with its suburbs; four cities.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	19	All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their suburbs.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	20	And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites, even the rest of the children of Kohath, they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	21	And they gave them Shechem with its suburbs in the hill-country of Ephraim, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Gezer with its suburbs,	6
ASV	Joshua	21	22	and Kibzaim with its suburbs, and Beth-horon with its suburbs; four cities.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	23	And out of the tribe of Dan, Elteke with its suburbs, Gibbethon with its suburbs,	6
ASV	Joshua	21	24	Aijalon with its suburbs, Gath-rimmon with its suburbs; four cities.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	25	And out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Taanach with its suburbs, and Gath-rimmon with its suburbs; two cities.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	26	All the cities of the families of the rest of the children of Kohath were ten with their suburbs.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	27	And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the half-tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in Bashan with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Be-eshterah with its suburbs; two cities.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	28	And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishion with its suburbs, Daberath with its suburbs,	6
ASV	Joshua	21	29	Jarmuth with its suburbs, En-gannim with its suburbs; four cities.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	30	And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its suburbs, Abdon with its suburbs,	6
ASV	Joshua	21	31	Helkath with its suburbs, and Rehob with its suburbs; four cities.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	32	And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Hammoth-dor with its suburbs, and Kartan with its suburbs; three cities.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	33	All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their suburbs.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	34	And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its suburbs, and Kartah with its suburbs,	6
ASV	Joshua	21	35	Dimnah with its suburbs, Nahalal with its suburbs; four cities.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	36	And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with its suburbs, and Jahaz with its suburbs,	6
ASV	Joshua	21	37	Kedemoth with its suburbs, and Mephaath with its suburbs; four cities.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	38	And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Mahanaim with its suburbs,	6
ASV	Joshua	21	39	Heshbon with its suburbs, Jazer with its suburbs; four cities in all.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	40	All these were the cities of the children of Merari according to their families, even the rest of the families of the Levites; and their lot was twelve cities.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	41	All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	42	These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus it was with all these cities.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	43	So Jehovah gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	44	And Jehovah gave them rest round about, according to all that he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; Jehovah delivered all their enemies into their hand.	6
ASV	Joshua	21	45	There failed not aught of any good thing which Jehovah had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.	6
ASV	Joshua	22	1	Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,	6
ASV	Joshua	22	2	and said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, and have hearkened unto my voice in all that I commanded you:	6
ASV	Joshua	22	3	ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of Jehovah your God.	6
ASV	Joshua	22	4	And now Jehovah your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he spake unto them: therefore now turn ye, and get you unto your tents, unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan.	6
ASV	Joshua	22	5	Only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, to love Jehovah your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart a	6
ASV	Joshua	22	6	So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went unto their tents.	6
ASV	Joshua	22	7	Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given inheritance in Bashan; but unto the other half gave Joshua among their brethren beyond the Jordan westward; moreover when Joshua sent them away unto their tents, he blessed them,	6
ASV	Joshua	22	8	and spake unto them, saying, Return with much wealth unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.	6
ASV	Joshua	22	9	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof the	6
ASV	Joshua	22	10	And when they came unto the region about the Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, a great altar to look upon.	6
ASV	Judges	9	27	And they went out into the field, and gathered their vineyards, and trod the grapes, and held festival, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.	7
ASV	Judges	9	28	And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve ye the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: but why should we serve him?	7
ASV	Judges	9	29	And would that this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.	7
ASV	Judges	9	30	And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.	7
ASV	Judges	9	31	And he sent messengers unto Abimelech craftily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren are come to Shechem; and, behold, they constrain the city to take part against thee.	7
ASV	Judges	9	32	Now therefore, up by night, thou and the people that are with thee, and lie in wait in the field:	7
ASV	Judges	9	33	and it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and rush upon the city; and, behold, when he and the people that are with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.	7
ASV	Judges	9	34	And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.	7
ASV	Judges	9	35	And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from the ambushment.	7
ASV	Judges	9	36	And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the tops of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.	7
ASV	Judges	9	37	And Gaal spake again and said, See, there come people down by the middle of the land, and one company cometh by the way of the oak of Meonenim.	7
ASV	Judges	9	38	Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, that thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that thou hast despised? go out now, I pray, and fight with them.	7
ASV	Judges	9	39	And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.	7
ASV	Judges	9	40	And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and there fell many wounded, even unto the entrance of the gate.	7
ASV	Judges	9	41	And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.	7
ASV	Judges	9	42	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.	7
ASV	Judges	9	43	And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field; and he looked, and, behold, the people came forth out of the city; And he rose up against them, and smote them.	7
ASV	Judges	9	44	And Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and the two companies rushed upon all that were in the field, and smote them.	7
ASV	Judges	9	45	And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that were therein: and he beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.	7
ASV	Judges	9	46	And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard thereof, they entered into the stronghold of the house of Elberith.	7
ASV	Judges	9	47	And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.	7
ASV	Judges	9	48	And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his shoulder: and he said unto the people that were with him, Wh	7
ASV	Judges	9	49	And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.	7
ASV	Judges	9	50	Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.	7
ASV	Judges	9	51	But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut themselves in, and gat them up to the roof of the tower.	7
ASV	Judges	9	52	And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and drew near unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.	7
ASV	Judges	9	53	And a certain woman cast an upper millstone upon Abimelechs head, and brake his skull.	7
ASV	Judges	9	54	Then he called hastily unto the young man his armorbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and kill me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.	7
ASV	Judges	9	55	And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place.	7
ASV	Judges	9	56	Thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren;	7
ASV	Judges	9	57	and all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did God requite upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.	7
ASV	Judges	10	1	And after Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in the hill-country of Ephraim.	7
ASV	Judges	10	2	And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.	7
ASV	Judges	10	3	And after him arose Jair, the Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty and two years.	7
ASV	Judges	10	4	And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth-jair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead.	7
ASV	Judges	10	5	And Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.	7
ASV	Judges	10	6	And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served the Baalim, and the Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Phil	7
ASV	Judges	10	7	And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the children of Ammon.	7
ASV	Judges	10	8	And they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel that year: eighteen years oppressed they all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.	7
ASV	Judges	10	9	And the children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.	7
ASV	Judges	10	10	And the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah, saying, We have sinned against thee, even because we have forsaken our God, and have served the Baalim.	7
ASV	Judges	10	11	And Jehovah said unto the children of Israel, Did not I save you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?	7
ASV	Judges	10	12	The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried unto me, and I saved you out of their hand.	7
ASV	Judges	10	13	Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will save you no more.	7
ASV	Judges	10	14	Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress.	7
ASV	Judges	10	15	And the children of Israel said unto Jehovah, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; only deliver us, we pray thee, this day.	7
ASV	Judges	10	16	And they put away the foreign gods from among them, and served Jehovah; and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.	7
ASV	Judges	10	17	Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpah.	7
ASV	Judges	10	18	And the people, the princes of Gilead, said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.	7
ASV	Judges	11	1	Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.	7
ASV	Judges	11	2	And Gileads wife bare him sons; and when his wifes sons grew up, they drove out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our fathers house; for thou art the son of another woman.	7
ASV	Judges	11	3	Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, and they went out with him.	7
ASV	Judges	11	4	And it came to pass after a while, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.	7
ASV	Judges	11	5	And it was so, that, when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob;	7
ASV	Judges	11	6	and they said unto Jephthah, Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.	7
ASV	Judges	11	7	And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and drive me out of my fathers house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?	7
ASV	Judges	11	8	And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore are we turned again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight with the children of Ammon; and thou shalt be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.	7
ASV	Judges	11	9	And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon, and Jehovah deliver them before me, shall I be your head?	7
ASV	Judges	11	10	And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Jehovah shall be witness between us; surely according to thy word so will we do.	7
ASV	Judges	11	11	Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them: and Jephthah spake all his words before Jehovah in Mizpah.	7
ASV	Judges	11	12	And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come unto me to fight against my land?	7
ASV	Judges	11	13	And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when he came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even unto the Jabbok, and unto the Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.	7
ASV	Judges	11	14	And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon;	7
ASV	Judges	11	15	and he said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah: Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon,	7
ASV	Judges	11	16	but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness unto the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh;	7
ASV	Judges	11	17	then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land; but the king of Edom hearkened not. And in like manner he sent unto the king of Moab; but he would not: and Israel abode in Kadesh.	7
ASV	Judges	11	18	Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they came not within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was	7
ASV	Judges	11	19	And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land unto my place.	7
ASV	Judges	11	20	But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.	7
ASV	Judges	11	21	And Jehovah, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.	7
ASV	Judges	11	22	And they possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even unto the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto the Jordan.	7
ASV	Judges	11	23	So now Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess them?	7
ASV	Judges	11	24	Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever Jehovah our God hath dispossessed from before us, them will we possess.	7
ASV	Judges	11	25	And now art thou anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them?	7
ASV	Judges	11	26	While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years; wherefore did ye not recover them within that time?	7
ASV	Judges	11	27	I therefore have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: Jehovah, the Judge, be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.	7
ASV	Judges	11	28	Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.	7
ASV	Judges	11	29	Then the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.	7
ASV	Judges	11	30	And Jephthah vowed a vow unto Jehovah, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,	7
ASV	Judges	11	31	then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth from the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be Jehovahs, and I will offer it up for a burnt-offering.	7
ASV	Judges	11	32	So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and Jehovah delivered them into his hand.	7
ASV	Judges	11	33	And he smote them from Aroer until thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.	7
ASV	Joshua	22	11	And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the side that pertaineth to the chil	6
ASV	Joshua	22	12	And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war.	6
ASV	Joshua	22	13	And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,	6
ASV	Joshua	22	14	and with him ten princes, one prince of a fathers house for each of the tribes of Israel; and they were every one of them head of their fathers houses among the thousands of Israel.	6
ASV	Joshua	22	15	And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,	6
ASV	Joshua	22	16	Thus saith the whole congregation of Jehovah, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following Jehovah, in that ye have builded you an altar, to rebel this day against Jehovah?	6
ASV	Joshua	22	17	Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves unto this day, although there came a plague upon the congregation of Jehovah,	6
ASV	Joshua	22	18	that ye must turn away this day from following Jehovah? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to-day against Jehovah, that to-morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.	6
ASV	Joshua	22	19	Howbeit, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of Jehovah, wherein Jehovahs tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against Jehovah, nor rebel against us, in building you an a	6
ASV	Joshua	22	20	Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.	6
ASV	Joshua	22	21	Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spake unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,	6
ASV	Joshua	22	22	The Mighty One, God, Jehovah, the Mighty One, God, Jehovah, he knoweth; and Israel he shall know: if it be in rebellion, or if in trespass against Jehovah (save thou us not this day,)	6
ASV	Joshua	22	23	that we have built us an altar to turn away from following Jehovah; or if to offer thereon burnt-offering or meal-offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace-offerings thereon, let Jehovah himself require it;	6
ASV	Joshua	22	24	and if we have not rather out of carefulness done this, and of purpose, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with Jehovah, the God of Israel?	6
ASV	Joshua	22	25	for Jehovah hath made the Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no portion in Jehovah: so might your children make our children cease from fearing Jehovah.	6
ASV	Joshua	22	26	Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice:	6
ASV	Joshua	22	27	but it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we may do the service of Jehovah before him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings; that your children may not say to our chi	6
ASV	Joshua	22	28	Therefore said we, It shall be, when they so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say, Behold the pattern of the altar of Jehovah, which our fathers made, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us	6
ASV	Joshua	22	29	Far be it from us that we should rebel against Jehovah, and turn away this day from following Jehovah, to build an altar for burnt-offering, for meal-offering, or for sacrifice, besides the altar of Jehovah our God that is before his tabernacle.	6
ASV	Joshua	22	30	And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them well.	6
ASV	Joshua	22	31	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we know that Jehovah is in the midst of us, because ye have not committed this trespass against Jehovah: now	6
ASV	Joshua	22	32	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.	6
ASV	Joshua	22	33	And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and spake no more of going up against them to war, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and the children of Gad dwelt.	6
ASV	Joshua	22	34	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: For, said they, it is a witness between us that Jehovah is God.	6
ASV	Joshua	23	1	And it came to pass after many days, when Jehovah had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua was old and well stricken in years;	6
ASV	Joshua	23	2	that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and for their heads, and for their judges and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old and well stricken in years:	6
ASV	Joshua	23	3	and ye have seen all that Jehovah your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for Jehovah your God, he it is that hath fought for you.	6
ASV	Joshua	23	4	Behold, I have allotted unto you these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun.	6
ASV	Joshua	23	5	And Jehovah your God, he will thrust them out from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as Jehovah your God spake unto you.	6
ASV	Joshua	23	6	Therefore be ye very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;	6
ASV	Joshua	23	7	that ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow down yourselves unto them;	6
ASV	Joshua	23	8	but cleave unto Jehovah your God, as ye have done unto this day.	6
ASV	Joshua	23	9	For Jehovah hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath stood before you unto this day.	6
ASV	Joshua	23	10	One man of you shall chase a thousand; for Jehovah your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he spake unto you.	6
ASV	Joshua	23	11	Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love Jehovah your God.	6
ASV	Joshua	23	12	Else if ye do at all go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you;	6
ASV	Joshua	23	13	know for a certainty that Jehovah your God will no more drive these nations from out of your sight; but they shall be a snare and a trap unto you, and a scourge in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which Jehovah	6
ASV	Joshua	23	14	And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which Jehovah your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, not one thin	6
ASV	Joshua	23	15	And it shall come to pass, that as all the good things are come upon you of which Jehovah your God spake unto you, so will Jehovah bring upon you all the evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which Jehovah your God hath given yo	6
ASV	Joshua	23	16	When ye transgress the covenant of Jehovah your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods, and bow down yourselves to them; then will the anger of Jehovah be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he h	6
ASV	Joshua	24	1	And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	2	And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt of old time beyond the River, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor: and they served other gods.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	3	And I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	4	And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it: and Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	5	And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did in the midst thereof: and afterward I brought you out.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	6	And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and with horsemen unto the Red Sea.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	7	And when they cried out unto Jehovah, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness many days.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	8	And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, that dwelt beyond the Jordan: and they fought with you; and I gave them into your hand, and ye possessed their land; and I destroyed them from before you.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	9	Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel: and he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you;	6
ASV	Joshua	24	10	but I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	11	And ye went over the Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	12	And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	13	And I gave you a land whereon thou hadst not labored, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell therein; of vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	14	Now therefore fear Jehovah, and serve him in sincerity and in truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt; and serve ye Jehovah.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	15	And if it seem evil unto you to serve Jehovah, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve Je	6
ASV	Joshua	24	16	And the people answered and said, Far be it from us that we should forsake Jehovah, to serve other gods;	6
ASV	Joshua	24	17	for Jehovah our God, he it is that brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and that did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the peoples through the midst	6
ASV	Joshua	24	18	and Jehovah drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites that dwelt in the land: therefore we also will serve Jehovah; for he is our God.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	19	And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve Jehovah; for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgression nor your sins.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	20	If ye forsake Jehovah, and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you evil, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	21	And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve Jehovah.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	22	And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you Jehovah, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	23	Now therefore put away, said he, the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto Jehovah, the God of Israel.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	24	And the people said unto Joshua, Jehovah our God will we serve, and unto his voice will we hearken.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	25	So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	26	And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Jehovah.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	27	And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it hath heard all the words of Jehovah which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness against you, lest ye deny your God.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	28	So Joshua sent the people away, every man unto his inheritance.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	29	And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, being a hundred and ten years old.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	30	And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	31	And Israel served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and had known all the work of Jehovah, that he had wrought for Israel.	6
ASV	Joshua	24	32	And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money: and they became the inheritance of	6
ASV	Joshua	24	33	And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill-country of Ephraim.	6
ASV	Judges	1	1	And it came to pass after the death of Joshua, that the children of Israel asked of Jehovah, saying, Who shall go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight against them?	7
ASV	Judges	1	2	And Jehovah said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.	7
ASV	Judges	1	3	And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.	7
ASV	Judges	1	4	And Judah went up; and Jehovah delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they smote of them in Bezek ten thousand men.	7
ASV	Judges	1	5	And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek; and they fought against him, and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites.	7
ASV	Judges	1	6	But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.	7
ASV	Judges	1	7	And Adoni-bezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their food under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.	7
ASV	Judges	1	8	And the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.	7
ASV	Judges	1	9	And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites that dwelt in the hill-country, and in the South, and in the lowland.	7
ASV	Judges	1	10	And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron (now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiriath-arba); and they smote Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.	7
ASV	Judges	1	11	And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir. (Now the name of Debir beforetime was Kiriath-sepher.)	7
ASV	Judges	1	12	And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.	7
ASV	Judges	1	13	And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Calebs younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.	7
ASV	Judges	1	14	And it came to pass, when she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she alighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?	7
ASV	Judges	1	15	And she said unto him, Give me a blessing; for that thou hast set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.	7
ASV	Judges	1	16	And the children of the Kenite, Moses brother-in-law, went up out of the city of palm-trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt with the people.	7
ASV	Judges	1	17	And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they smote the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.	7
ASV	Judges	1	18	Also Judah took Gaza with the border thereof, and Ashkelon with the border thereof, and Ekron with the border thereof.	7
ASV	Judges	1	19	And Jehovah was with Judah; and drove out the inhabitants of the hill-country; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.	7
ASV	Judges	1	20	And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses had spoken: and he drove out thence the three sons of Anak.	7
ASV	Judges	1	21	And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.	7
ASV	Judges	1	22	And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el; and Jehovah was with them.	7
ASV	Judges	1	23	And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Beth-el. (Now the name of the city beforetime was Luz.)	7
ASV	Judges	1	24	And the watchers saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with thee.	7
ASV	Judges	1	25	And he showed them the entrance into the city; and they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man go and all his family.	7
ASV	Judges	1	26	And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz, which is the name thereof unto this day.	7
ASV	Judges	1	27	And Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its towns, nor of Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanit	7
ASV	Judges	1	28	And it came to pass, when Israel was waxed strong, that they put the Canaanites to taskwork, and did not utterly drive them out.	7
ASV	Judges	1	29	And Ephraim drove not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.	7
ASV	Judges	1	30	Zebulun drove not out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became subject to taskwork.	7
ASV	Judges	1	31	Asher drove not out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob;	7
ASV	Judges	1	32	but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.	7
ASV	Judges	1	33	Naphtali drove not out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject to taskwork.	7
ASV	Judges	1	34	And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill-country; for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley;	7
ASV	Judges	1	35	but the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became subject to taskwork.	7
ASV	Judges	1	36	And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.	7
ASV	Judges	2	1	And the angel of Jehovah came up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you:	7
ASV	Judges	2	2	and ye shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall break down their altars. But ye have not hearkened unto my voice: why have ye done this?	7
ASV	Judges	2	3	Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.	7
ASV	Judges	2	4	And it came to pass, when the angel of Jehovah spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.	7
ASV	Judges	2	5	And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto Jehovah.	7
ASV	Judges	2	6	Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.	7
ASV	Judges	2	7	And the people served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of Jehovah that he had wrought for Israel.	7
ASV	Judges	2	8	And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, being a hundred and ten years old.	7
ASV	Judges	2	9	And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.	7
ASV	Judges	2	10	And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, that knew not Jehovah, nor yet the work which he had wrought for Israel.	7
ASV	Judges	2	11	And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served the Baalim;	7
ASV	Judges	2	12	and they forsook Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples that were round about them, and bowed themselves down unto them: and they provoked Jehovah to anger.	7
ASV	Judges	2	13	And they forsook Jehovah, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.	7
ASV	Judges	2	14	And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that despoiled them; and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.	7
ASV	Judges	2	15	Whithersoever they went out, the hand of Jehovah was against them for evil, as Jehovah had spoken, and as Jehovah had sworn unto them: and they were sore distressed.	7
ASV	Judges	2	16	And Jehovah raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those that despoiled them.	7
ASV	Judges	2	17	And yet they hearkened not unto their judges; for they played the harlot after other gods, and bowed themselves down unto them: they turned aside quickly out of the way wherein their fathers walked, obeying the commandments of Jehovah; but they did not so	7
ASV	Judges	2	18	And when Jehovah raised them up judges, then Jehovah was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented Jehovah because of their groaning by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.	7
ASV	Judges	2	19	But it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their doings, nor from their stubborn way.	7
ASV	Judges	2	20	And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel; and he said, Because this nation have transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;	7
ASV	Judges	2	21	I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when he died;	7
ASV	Judges	2	22	that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of Jehovah to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.	7
ASV	Judges	2	23	So Jehovah left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.	7
ASV	Judges	3	1	Now these are the nations which Jehovah left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;	7
ASV	Judges	3	2	only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as beforetime knew nothing thereof:	7
ASV	Judges	3	3	namely, the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entrance of Hamath.	7
ASV	Judges	3	4	And they were left, to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah, which he commanded their fathers by Moses.	7
ASV	Judges	3	5	And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites:	7
ASV	Judges	3	6	and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.	7
ASV	Judges	3	7	And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and forgat Jehovah their God, and served the Baalim and the Asheroth.	7
ASV	Judges	3	8	Therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years.	7
ASV	Judges	3	9	And when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah, Jehovah raised up a saviour to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Calebs younger brother.	7
ASV	Judges	3	10	And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Jehovah delivered Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand: and his hand prevailed against Cushan-rishathaim.	7
ASV	Judges	3	11	And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.	7
ASV	Judges	3	12	And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and Jehovah strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.	7
ASV	Judges	3	13	And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and smote Israel, and they possessed the city of palm-trees.	7
ASV	Judges	3	14	And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.	7
ASV	Judges	3	15	But when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah, Jehovah raised them up a saviour, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a man left-handed. And the children of Israel sent tribute by him unto Eglon the king of Moab.	7
ASV	Judges	3	16	And Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh.	7
ASV	Judges	3	17	And he offered the tribute unto Eglon king of Moab: now Eglon was a very fat man.	7
ASV	Judges	3	18	And when he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away the people that bare the tribute.	7
ASV	Judges	3	19	But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king. And he said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.	7
ASV	Judges	3	20	And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.	7
ASV	Judges	3	21	And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body:	7
ASV	Judges	3	22	and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, for he drew not the sword out of his body; and it came out behind.	7
ASV	Judges	3	23	Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room upon him, and locked them.	7
ASV	Judges	3	24	Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said, Surely he is covering his feet in the upper chamber.	7
ASV	Judges	3	25	And they tarried till they were ashamed; and, behold, he opened not the doors of the upper room: therefore they took the key, and opened them, and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.	7
ASV	Judges	3	26	And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirah.	7
ASV	Judges	3	27	And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he before them.	7
ASV	Judges	3	28	And he said unto them, Follow after me; for Jehovah hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and suffered not a man to pass over.	7
ASV	Judges	3	29	And they smote of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there escaped not a man.	7
ASV	Judges	3	30	So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.	7
ASV	Judges	3	31	And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who smote of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad: and he also saved Israel.	7
ASV	Judges	4	1	And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, when Ehud was dead.	7
ASV	Judges	4	2	And Jehovah sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.	7
ASV	Judges	4	3	And the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.	7
ASV	Judges	4	4	Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time.	7
ASV	Judges	4	5	And she dwelt under the palm-tree of Deborah between Ramah and Beth-el in the hill-country of Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.	7
ASV	Judges	4	6	And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him, Hath not Jehovah, the God of Israel, commanded, saying, Go and draw unto mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the ch	7
ASV	Judges	4	7	And I will draw unto thee, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabins army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thy hand.	7
ASV	Judges	4	8	And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go; but if thou wilt not go with me, I will not go.	7
ASV	Judges	4	9	And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding, the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honor; for Jehovah will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.	7
ASV	Judges	4	10	And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.	7
ASV	Judges	4	11	Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the brother-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.	7
ASV	Judges	4	12	And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.	7
ASV	Judges	4	13	And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, unto the river Kishon.	7
ASV	Judges	4	14	And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which Jehovah hath delivered Sisera into thy hand; is not Jehovah gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.	7
ASV	Judges	4	15	And Jehovah discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.	7
ASV	Judges	4	16	But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.	7
ASV	Judges	4	17	Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.	7
ASV	Judges	4	18	And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And he turned in unto her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.	7
ASV	Judges	4	19	And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.	7
ASV	Judges	4	20	And he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.	7
ASV	Judges	4	21	Then Jael Hebers wife took a tent-pin, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died.	7
ASV	Judges	4	22	And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest. And he came unto her; and, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent-pin was in his temples.	7
ASV	Judges	4	23	So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.	7
ASV	Judges	4	24	And the hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.	7
ASV	Judges	5	1	Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,	7
ASV	Judges	5	2	For that the leaders took the lead in Israel, For that the people offered themselves willingly, Bless ye Jehovah.	7
ASV	Judges	5	3	Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto Jehovah; I will sing praise to Jehovah, the God of Israel.	7
ASV	Judges	5	4	Jehovah, when thou wentest forth out of Seir, When thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, The earth trembled, the heavens also dropped, Yea, the clouds dropped water.	7
ASV	Judges	5	5	The mountains quaked at the presence of Jehovah, Even yon Sinai at the presence of Jehovah, the God of Israel.	7
ASV	Judges	5	6	In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, In the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, And the travellers walked through byways.	7
ASV	Judges	5	7	The rulers ceased in Israel, they ceased, Until that I Deborah arose, That I arose a mother in Israel.	7
ASV	Judges	5	8	They chose new gods; Then was war in the gates: Was there a shield or spear seen Among forty thousand in Israel?	7
ASV	Judges	5	9	My heart is toward the governors of Israel, That offered themselves willingly among the people: Bless ye Jehovah.	7
ASV	Judges	5	10	Tell of it, ye that ride on white asses, Ye that sit on rich carpets, And ye that walk by the way.	7
ASV	Judges	5	11	Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing water, There shall they rehearse the righteous acts of Jehovah, Even the righteous acts of his rule in Israel. Then the people of Jehovah went down to the gates.	7
ASV	Judges	5	12	Awake, awake, Deborah; Awake, awake, utter a song: Arise, Barak, and lead away thy captives, thou son of Abinoam.	7
ASV	Judges	5	13	Then came down a remnant of the nobles and the people; Jehovah came down for me against the mighty.	7
ASV	Judges	5	14	Out of Ephraim came down they whose root is in Amalek; After thee, Benjamin, among thy peoples; Out of Machir came down governors, And out of Zebulun they that handle the marshals staff.	7
ASV	Judges	5	15	And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; As was Issachar, so was Barak; Into the valley they rushed forth at his feet. By the watercourses of Reuben There were great resolves of heart.	7
ASV	Judges	5	16	Why sattest thou among the sheepfolds, To hear the pipings for the flocks? At the watercourses of Reuben There were great searchings of heart.	7
ASV	Judges	5	17	Gilead abode beyond the Jordan: And Dan, why did he remain in ships? Asher sat still at the haven of the sea, And abode by his creeks.	7
ASV	Judges	5	18	Zebulun was a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death, And Naphtali, upon the high places of the field.	7
ASV	Judges	5	19	The kings came and fought; Then fought the kings of Canaan. In Taanach by the waters of Megiddo: They took no gain of money.	7
ASV	Judges	5	20	From heaven fought the stars, From their courses they fought against Sisera.	7
ASV	Judges	5	21	The river Kishon swept them away, That ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, march on with strength.	7
ASV	Judges	5	22	Then did the horsehoofs stamp By reason of the prancings, the prancings of their strong ones.	7
ASV	Judges	5	23	Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of Jehovah. Curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof, Because they came not to the help of Jehovah, To the help of Jehovah against the mighty.	7
ASV	Judges	5	24	Blessed above women shall Jael be, The wife of Heber the Kenite; Blessed shall she be above women in the tent.	7
ASV	Judges	5	25	He asked water, and she gave him milk; She brought him butter in a lordly dish.	7
ASV	Judges	5	26	She put her hand to the tent-pin, And her right hand to the workmens hammer; And with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote through his head; Yea, she pierced and struck through his temples.	7
ASV	Judges	5	27	At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay; At her feet he bowed, he fell; Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.	7
ASV	Judges	5	28	Through the window she looked forth, and cried, The mother of Sisera cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why tarry the wheels of his chariots?	7
ASV	Judges	5	29	Her wise ladies answered her, Yea, she returned answer to herself,	7
ASV	Judges	5	30	Have they not found, have they not divided the spoil? A damsel, two damsels to every man; To Sisera a spoil of dyed garments, A spoil of dyed garments embroidered, Of dyed garments embroidered on both sides, on the necks of the spoil?	7
ASV	Judges	5	31	So let all thine enemies perish, O Jehovah: But let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.	7
ASV	Judges	6	1	And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.	7
ASV	Judges	6	2	And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.	7
ASV	Judges	6	3	And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east; they came up against them;	7
ASV	Judges	6	4	and they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.	7
ASV	Judges	6	5	For they came up with their cattle and their tents; they came in as locusts for multitude; both they and their camels were without number: and they came into the land to destroy it.	7
ASV	Judges	6	6	And Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah.	7
ASV	Judges	6	7	And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah because of Midian,	7
ASV	Judges	6	8	that Jehovah sent a prophet unto the children of Israel: and he said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;	7
ASV	Judges	6	9	and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land;	7
ASV	Judges	6	10	and I said unto you, I am Jehovah your God; ye shall not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell. But ye have not hearkened unto my voice.	7
ASV	Judges	6	11	And the angel of Jehovah came, and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.	7
ASV	Judges	6	12	And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto him, and said unto him, Jehovah is with thee, thou mighty man of valor.	7
ASV	Judges	6	13	And Gideon said unto him, Oh, my lord, if Jehovah is with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where are all his wondrous works which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not Jehovah bring us up from Egypt? but now Jehovah hath cast us off, and delive	7
ASV	Judges	6	14	And Jehovah looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and save Israel from the hand of Midian: have not I sent thee?	7
ASV	Judges	6	15	And he said unto him, Oh, Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my fathers house.	7
ASV	Judges	6	16	And Jehovah said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.	7
ASV	Judges	6	17	And he said unto him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, then show me a sign that it is thou that talkest with me.	7
ASV	Judges	6	18	Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and lay it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.	7
ASV	Judges	6	19	And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.	7
ASV	Judges	6	20	And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.	7
ASV	Judges	6	21	Then the angel of Jehovah put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there went up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of Jehovah departed out o	7
ASV	Judges	6	22	And Gideon saw that he was the angel of Jehovah; and Gideon said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah! forasmuch as I have seen the angel of Jehovah face to face.	7
ASV	Judges	6	23	And Jehovah said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.	7
ASV	Judges	6	24	Then Gideon built an altar there unto Jehovah, and called it Jehovah-shalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.	7
ASV	Judges	6	25	And it came to pass the same night, that Jehovah said unto him, Take thy fathers bullock, even the second bullock seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the Asherah that is by it;	7
ASV	Judges	6	26	and build an altar unto Jehovah thy God upon the top of this stronghold, in the orderly manner, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt-offering with the wood of the Asherah which thou shalt cut down.	7
ASV	Judges	6	27	Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as Jehovah had spoken unto him: and it came to pass, because he feared his fathers household and the men of the city, so that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.	7
ASV	Judges	6	28	And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.	7
ASV	Judges	6	29	And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.	7
ASV	Judges	6	30	Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die, because he hath broken down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the Asherah that was by it.	7
ASV	Judges	6	31	And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye contend for Baal? Or will ye save him? he that will contend for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him contend for himself, because one hath broken down his al	7
ASV	Judges	6	32	Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal contend against him, because he hath broken down his altar.	7
ASV	Judges	6	33	Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.	7
ASV	Judges	6	34	But the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Gideon; and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered together after him.	7
ASV	Judges	6	35	And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were gathered together after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.	7
ASV	Judges	6	36	And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast spoken,	7
ASV	Judges	6	37	behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing-floor; if there be dew on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the ground, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast spoken.	7
ASV	Judges	6	38	And it was so; for he rose up early on the morrow, and pressed the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water.	7
ASV	Judges	6	39	And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once: let me make trial, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.	7
ASV	Judges	6	40	And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.	7
ASV	Judges	7	1	Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and encamped beside the spring of Harod: and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.	7
ASV	Judges	7	2	And Jehovah said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.	7
ASV	Judges	7	3	Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.	7
ASV	Judges	7	4	And Jehovah said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unt	7
ASV	Judges	7	5	So he brought down the people unto the water: and Jehovah said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.	7
ASV	Judges	7	6	And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.	7
ASV	Judges	7	7	And Jehovah said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand; and let all the people go every man unto his place.	7
ASV	Judges	7	8	So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets; and he sent all the men of Israel every man unto his tent, but retained the three hundred men: and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.	7
ASV	Judges	7	9	And it came to pass the same night, that Jehovah said unto him, Arise, get thee down into the camp; for I have delivered it into thy hand.	7
ASV	Judges	7	10	But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Purah thy servant down to the camp:	7
ASV	Judges	7	11	and thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thy hands be strengthened to go down into the camp. Then went he down with Purah his servant unto the outermost part of the armed men that were in the camp.	7
ASV	Judges	7	12	And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is upon the sea-shore for multitude.	7
ASV	Judges	7	13	And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man telling a dream unto his fellow; and he said, Behold, I dreamed a dream; and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came unto the tent, and smote it so that it fell, and turned it	7
ASV	Judges	7	14	And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: into his hand God hath delivered Midian, and all the host.	7
ASV	Judges	7	15	And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped; and he returned into the camp of Israel, and said, Arise; for Jehovah hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.	7
ASV	Judges	7	16	And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets, and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers.	7
ASV	Judges	7	17	And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.	7
ASV	Judges	7	18	When I blow the trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, For Jehovah and for Gideon.	7
ASV	Judges	7	19	So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands.	7
ASV	Judges	7	20	And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands wherewith to blow; and they cried, The sword of Jehovah and of Gideon.	7
ASV	Judges	7	21	And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran; and they shouted, and put them to flight.	7
ASV	Judges	7	22	And they blew the three hundred trumpets, and Jehovah set every mans sword against his fellow, and against all the host; and the host fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.	7
ASV	Judges	7	23	And the men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.	7
ASV	Judges	7	24	And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill-country of Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and take before them the waters, as far as Beth-barah, even the Jordan. So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the waters as far a	7
ASV	Judges	7	25	And they took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian: and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.	7
ASV	Judges	8	1	And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with Midian? And they did chide with him sharply.	7
ASV	Judges	8	2	And he said unto them, What have I now done in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?	7
ASV	Judges	8	3	God hath delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison with you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.	7
ASV	Judges	8	4	And Gideon came to the Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing.	7
ASV	Judges	8	5	And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.	7
ASV	Judges	8	6	And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?	7
ASV	Judges	8	7	And Gideon said, Therefore when Jehovah hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.	7
ASV	Judges	8	8	And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them in like manner; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.	7
ASV	Judges	8	9	And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.	7
ASV	Judges	8	10	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the host of the children of the east; for there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.	7
ASV	Judges	8	11	And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure.	7
ASV	Judges	8	12	And Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he pursued after them; and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.	7
ASV	Judges	8	13	And Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres.	7
ASV	Judges	8	14	And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described for him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, seventy and seven men.	7
ASV	Judges	8	15	And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom ye did taunt me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?	7
ASV	Judges	8	16	And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.	7
ASV	Judges	8	17	And he brake down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.	7
ASV	Judges	8	18	Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.	7
ASV	Judges	8	19	And he said, They were my brethren, the sons of my mother: as Jehovah liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.	7
ASV	Judges	8	20	And he said unto Jether his first-born, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword; for he feared, because he was yet a youth.	7
ASV	Judges	8	21	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us; for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels necks.	7
ASV	Judges	8	22	Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy sons son also; for thou hast saved us out of the hand of Midian.	7
ASV	Judges	8	23	And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: Jehovah shall rule over you.	7
ASV	Judges	8	24	And Gideon said unto them, I would make a request of you, that ye would give me every man the ear-rings of his spoil. (For they had golden ear-rings, because they were Ishmaelites.)	7
ASV	Judges	8	25	And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the ear-rings of his spoil.	7
ASV	Judges	8	26	And the weight of the golden ear-rings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold, besides the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were about their camels	7
ASV	Judges	8	27	And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel played the harlot after it there; and it became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.	7
ASV	Judges	8	28	So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.	7
ASV	Judges	8	29	And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.	7
ASV	Judges	8	30	And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten; for he had many wives.	7
ASV	Judges	8	31	And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, and he called his name Abimelech.	7
ASV	Judges	8	32	And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.	7
ASV	Judges	8	33	And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and played the harlot after the Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god.	7
ASV	Judges	8	34	And the children of Israel remembered not Jehovah their God, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side;	7
ASV	Judges	8	35	neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had showed unto Israel.	7
ASV	Judges	9	1	And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mothers brethren, and spake with them, and with all the family of the house of his mothers father, saying,	7
ASV	Judges	9	2	Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are threescore and ten persons, rule over you, or that one rule over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.	7
ASV	Judges	9	3	And his mothers brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.	7
ASV	Judges	9	4	And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light fellows, who followed him.	7
ASV	Judges	9	5	And he went unto his fathers house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.	7
ASV	Judges	9	6	And all the men of Shechem assembled themselves together, and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem.	7
ASV	Judges	9	7	And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.	7
ASV	Judges	9	8	The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive-tree, Reign thou over us.	7
ASV	Judges	9	9	But the olive-tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honor God and man, and go to wave to and fro over the trees?	7
ASV	Judges	9	10	And the trees said to the fig-tree, Come thou, and reign over us.	7
ASV	Judges	9	11	But the fig-tree said unto them, Should I leave my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to wave to and fro over the trees?	7
ASV	Judges	9	12	And the trees said unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.	7
ASV	Judges	9	13	And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my new wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to wave to and fro over the trees?	7
ASV	Judges	9	14	Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.	7
ASV	Judges	9	15	And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade; and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.	7
ASV	Judges	9	16	Now therefore, if ye have dealt truly and uprightly, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands;	7
ASV	Judges	9	17	(for my father fought for you, and adventured his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:	7
ASV	Judges	9	18	and ye are risen up against my fathers house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maid-servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother);	7
ASV	Judges	9	19	if ye then have dealt truly and uprightly with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:	7
ASV	Judges	9	20	but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.	7
ASV	Judges	9	21	And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.	7
ASV	Judges	9	22	And Abimelech was prince over Israel three years.	7
ASV	Judges	9	23	And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:	7
ASV	Judges	9	24	that the violence done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid upon Abimelech their brother, who slew them, and upon the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to slay his brethren.	7
ASV	Judges	9	25	And the men of Shechem set liers-in-wait for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.	7
ASV	Judges	9	26	And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him.	7
ASV	Judges	11	34	And Jephthah came to Mizpah unto his house; and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter.	7
ASV	Judges	11	35	And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me; for I have opened my mouth unto Jehovah, and I cannot go back.	7
ASV	Judges	11	36	And she said unto him, My father, thou hast opened thy mouth unto Jehovah; do unto me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth, forasmuch as Jehovah hath taken vengeance for thee on thine enemies, even on the children of Ammon.	7
ASV	Judges	11	37	And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may depart and go down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.	7
ASV	Judges	11	38	And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she departed, she and her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.	7
ASV	Judges	11	39	And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew not man. And it was a custom in Israel,	7
ASV	Judges	11	40	that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.	7
ASV	Judges	12	1	And the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed northward; and they said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thy house upon thee with fire.	7
ASV	Judges	12	2	And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye saved me not out of their hand.	7
ASV	Judges	12	3	And when I saw that ye saved me not, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and Jehovah delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?	7
ASV	Judges	12	4	Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye are fugitives of Ephraim, ye Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, and in the midst of Manasseh.	7
ASV	Judges	12	5	And the Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. And it was so, that, when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, Let me go over, the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;	7
ASV	Judges	12	6	then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth; and he said Sibboleth; for he could not frame to pronounce it right: then they laid hold on him, and slew him at the fords of the Jordan. And there fell at that time of Ephraim forty and two thousand.	7
ASV	Judges	12	7	And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.	7
ASV	Judges	12	8	And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged Israel.	7
ASV	Judges	12	9	And he had thirty sons; and thirty daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.	7
ASV	Judges	12	10	And Ibzan died, and was buried at Beth-lehem.	7
ASV	Judges	12	11	And after him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.	7
ASV	Judges	12	12	And Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.	7
ASV	Judges	12	13	And after him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.	7
ASV	Judges	12	14	And he had forty sons and thirty sons sons, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.	7
ASV	Judges	12	15	And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill-country of the Amalekites.	7
ASV	Judges	13	1	And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah; and Jehovah delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.	7
ASV	Judges	13	2	And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.	7
ASV	Judges	13	3	And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not; but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.	7
ASV	Judges	13	4	Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:	7
ASV	Judges	13	5	for, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.	7
ASV	Judges	13	6	Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the angel of God, very terrible; and I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:	7
ASV	Judges	13	7	but he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb to the day of his death.	7
ASV	Judges	13	8	Then Manoah entreated Jehovah, and said, Oh, Lord, I pray thee, let the man of God whom thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.	7
ASV	Judges	13	9	And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.	7
ASV	Judges	13	10	And the woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the other day.	7
ASV	Judges	13	11	And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am.	7
ASV	Judges	13	12	And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass: what shall be the ordering of the child, and how shall we do unto him?	7
ASV	Judges	13	13	And the angel of Jehovah said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.	7
ASV	Judges	13	14	She may not eat of anything that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.	7
ASV	Judges	13	15	And Manoah said unto the angel of Jehovah, I pray thee, let us detain thee, that we may make ready a kid for thee.	7
ASV	Judges	13	16	And the angel of Jehovah said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wilt make ready a burnt-offering, thou must offer it unto Jehovah. For Manoah knew not that he was the angel of Jehovah.	7
ASV	Judges	13	17	And Manoah said unto the angel of Jehovah, What is thy name, that, when thy words come to pass, we may do thee honor?	7
ASV	Judges	13	18	And the angel of Jehovah said unto him, Wherefore askest thou after my name, seeing it is wonderful?	7
ASV	Judges	13	19	So Manoah took the kid with the meal-offering, and offered it upon the rock unto Jehovah: and the angel did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.	7
ASV	Judges	13	20	For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of Jehovah ascended in the flame of the altar: and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground.	7
ASV	Judges	13	21	But the angel of Jehovah did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of Jehovah.	7
ASV	Judges	13	22	And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.	7
ASV	Judges	13	23	But his wife said unto him, If Jehovah were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and a meal-offering at our hand, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these.	7
ASV	Judges	13	24	And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and Jehovah blessed him.	7
ASV	Judges	13	25	And the Spirit of Jehovah began to move him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.	7
ASV	Judges	14	1	And Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines.	7
ASV	Judges	14	2	And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.	7
ASV	Judges	14	3	Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she ple	7
ASV	Judges	14	4	But his father and his mother knew not that it was of Jehovah; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel.	7
ASV	Judges	14	5	Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.	7
ASV	Judges	14	6	And the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid; and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.	7
ASV	Judges	14	7	And he went down, and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well.	7
ASV	Judges	14	8	And after a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.	7
ASV	Judges	14	9	And he took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went; and he came to his father and mother, and gave unto them, and they did eat: but he told them not that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion.	7
ASV	Judges	14	10	And his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.	7
ASV	Judges	14	11	And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.	7
ASV	Judges	14	12	And Samson said unto them, Let me now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can declare it unto me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment;	7
ASV	Judges	14	13	but if ye cannot declare it unto me, then shall ye give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.	7
ASV	Judges	14	14	And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth food, And out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days declare the riddle.	7
ASV	Judges	14	15	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samsons wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy fathers house with fire: have ye called us to impoverish us? is it not so?	7
ASV	Judges	14	16	And Samsons wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall	7
ASV	Judges	14	17	And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she pressed him sore; and she told the riddle to the children of her people.	7
ASV	Judges	14	18	And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, Ye had not found out my riddle.	7
ASV	Judges	14	19	And the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and smote thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave the changes of raiment unto them that declared the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father	7
ASV	Judges	14	20	But Samsons wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.	7
ASV	Judges	15	1	But it came to pass after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.	7
ASV	Judges	15	2	And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.	7
ASV	Judges	15	3	And Samson said unto them, This time shall I be blameless in regard of the Philistines, when I do them a mischief.	7
ASV	Judges	15	4	And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between every two tails.	7
ASV	Judges	15	5	And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the oliveyards.	7
ASV	Judges	15	6	Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they said, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he hath taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.	7
ASV	Judges	15	7	And Samson said unto them, If ye do after this manner, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.	7
ASV	Judges	15	8	And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Etam.	7
ASV	Judges	15	9	Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.	7
ASV	Judges	15	10	And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they said, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.	7
ASV	Judges	15	11	Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what then is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I	7
ASV	Judges	15	12	And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.	7
ASV	Judges	15	13	And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.	7
ASV	Judges	15	14	When he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him: and the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon him, and the ropes that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands dropped from off his hands.	7
ASV	Judges	15	15	And he found a fresh jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and smote a thousand men therewith.	7
ASV	Judges	15	16	And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, With the jawbone of an ass have I smitten a thousand men.	7
ASV	Judges	15	17	And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called Ramath-lehi.	7
ASV	Judges	15	18	And he was sore athirst, and called on Jehovah, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance by the hand of thy servant; and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised.	7
ASV	Judges	15	19	But God clave the hollow place that is in Lehi, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore the name thereof was called En-hakkore, which is in Lehi, unto this day.	7
ASV	Judges	15	20	And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.	7
ASV	Judges	16	1	And Samson went to Gaza, and saw there a harlot, and went in unto her.	7
ASV	Judges	16	2	And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, Let be till morning light, then we will kill him.	7
ASV	Judges	16	3	And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and laid hold of the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before He	7
ASV	Judges	16	4	And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.	7
ASV	Judges	16	5	And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hun	7
ASV	Judges	16	6	And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.	7
ASV	Judges	16	7	And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withes that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be as another man.	7
ASV	Judges	16	8	Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withes which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.	7
ASV	Judges	16	9	Now she had liers-in-wait abiding in the inner chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withes, as a string of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.	7
ASV	Judges	16	10	And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.	7
ASV	Judges	16	11	And he said unto her, If they only bind me with new ropes wherewith no work hath been done, then shall I become weak, and be as another man.	7
ASV	Judges	16	12	So Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And the liers-in-wait were abiding in the inner chamber. And he brake them off his arms like a thread.	7
ASV	Judges	16	13	And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.	7
ASV	Judges	16	14	And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and plucked away the pin of the beam, and the web.	7
ASV	Judges	16	15	And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thy heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.	7
ASV	Judges	16	16	And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, that his soul was vexed unto death.	7
ASV	Judges	16	17	And he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon my head; for I have been a Nazirite unto God from my mothers womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.	7
ASV	Judges	16	18	And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath told me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought the money in their	7
ASV	Judges	16	19	And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and shaved off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.	7
ASV	Judges	16	20	And she said, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times, and shake myself free. But he knew not that Jehovah was departed from him.	7
ASV	Judges	16	21	And the Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison-house.	7
ASV	Judges	16	22	Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.	7
ASV	Judges	16	23	And the lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.	7
ASV	Judges	16	24	And when the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hand our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, who hath slain many of us.	7
ASV	Judges	16	25	And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison-house; and he made sport before them. And they set him between the pillars:	7
ASV	Judges	16	26	and Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house resteth, that I may lean upon them.	7
ASV	Judges	16	27	Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.	7
ASV	Judges	16	28	And Samson called unto Jehovah, and said, O Lord Jehovah, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.	7
ASV	Judges	16	29	And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house rested, and leaned upon them, the one with his right hand, and the other with his left.	7
ASV	Judges	16	30	And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead that he slew at his death were more than they that he slew in his life.	7
ASV	Judges	16	31	Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burying-place of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.	7
ASV	Judges	17	1	And there was a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.	7
ASV	Judges	17	2	And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou didst utter a curse, and didst also speak it in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be my son of Jeh	7
ASV	Judges	17	3	And he restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother; and his mother said, I verily dedicate the silver unto Jehovah from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.	7
ASV	Judges	17	4	And when he restored the money unto his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and it was in the house of Micah.	7
ASV	Judges	17	5	And the man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.	7
ASV	Judges	17	6	In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.	7
ASV	Judges	17	7	And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he sojourned there.	7
ASV	Judges	17	8	And the man departed out of the city, out of Beth-lehem-judah, to sojourn where he could find a place, and he came to the hill-country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.	7
ASV	Judges	17	9	And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.	7
ASV	Judges	17	10	And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten pieces of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.	7
ASV	Judges	17	11	And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.	7
ASV	Judges	17	12	And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.	7
ASV	Judges	17	13	Then said Micah, Now know I that Jehovah will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.	7
ASV	Judges	18	1	In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.	7
ASV	Judges	18	2	And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their whole number, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land. And they came to the hill-country of Ephraim, u	7
ASV	Judges	18	3	When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; and they turned aside thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what doest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?	7
ASV	Judges	18	4	And he said unto them, Thus and thus hath Micah dealt with me, and he hath hired me, and I am become his priest.	7
ASV	Judges	18	5	And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.	7
ASV	Judges	18	6	And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before Jehovah is your way wherein ye go.	7
ASV	Judges	18	7	Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt in security, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was none in the land, possessing authority, that might put them to shame in any	7
ASV	Judges	18	8	And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What say ye?	7
ASV	Judges	18	9	And they said, Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land.	7
ASV	Judges	18	10	When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and the land is large; for God hath given it into your hand, a place where there is no want of anything that is in the earth.	7
ASV	Judges	18	11	And there set forth from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men girt with weapons of war.	7
ASV	Judges	18	12	And they went up, and encamped in Kiriath-jearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan, unto this day; behold, it is behind Kiriath-jearim.	7
ASV	Judges	18	13	And they passed thence unto the hill-country of Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah.	7
ASV	Judges	18	14	Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.	7
ASV	Judges	18	15	And they turned aside thither, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare.	7
ASV	Judges	18	16	And the six hundred men girt with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.	7
ASV	Judges	18	17	And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men girt with weapons of w	7
ASV	Judges	18	18	And when these went into Micahs house, and fetched the graven image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said unto them, What do ye?	7
ASV	Judges	18	19	And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be priest unto the house of one man, or to be priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?	7
ASV	Judges	18	20	And the priests heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.	7
ASV	Judges	18	21	So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the goods before them.	7
ASV	Judges	18	22	When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micahs house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.	7
ASV	Judges	18	23	And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?	7
ASV	Judges	18	24	And he said, ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and are gone away, and what have I more? and how then say ye unto me, What aileth thee?	7
ASV	Judges	18	25	And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.	7
ASV	Judges	18	26	And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.	7
ASV	Judges	18	27	And they took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people quiet and secure, and smote them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt the city with fire.	7
ASV	Judges	18	28	And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Beth-rehob. And they built the city, and dwelt therein.	7
ASV	Judges	18	29	And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first.	7
ASV	Judges	18	30	And the children of Dan set up for themselves the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.	7
ASV	Judges	18	31	So they set them up Micahs graven image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.	7
ASV	Judges	19	1	And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-lehem-judah.	7
ASV	Judges	19	2	And his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him unto her fathers house to Beth-lehem-judah, and was there the space of four months.	7
ASV	Judges	19	3	And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly unto her, to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her fathers house; and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.	7
ASV	Judges	19	4	And his father-in-law, the damsels father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.	7
ASV	Judges	19	5	And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart: and the damsels father said unto his son-in-law, Strengthen thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward ye shall go your way.	7
ASV	Judges	19	6	So they sat down, and did eat and drink, both of them together: and the damsels father said unto the man, Be pleased, I pray thee, to tarry all night, and let thy heart be merry.	7
ASV	Judges	19	7	And the man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he lodged there again.	7
ASV	Judges	19	8	And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsels father said, Strengthen thy heart, I pray thee, and tarry ye until the day declineth; and they did eat, both of them.	7
ASV	Judges	19	9	And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsels father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that t	7
ASV	Judges	19	10	But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus (the same is Jerusalem): and there were with him a couple of asses saddled; his concubine also was with him.	7
ASV	Judges	19	11	When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.	7
ASV	Judges	19	12	And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside into the city of a foreigner, that is not of the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah.	7
ASV	Judges	19	13	And he said unto his servant, Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.	7
ASV	Judges	19	14	So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them near to Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.	7
ASV	Judges	19	15	And they turned aside thither, to go in to lodge in Gibeah: and he went in, and sat him down in the street of the city; for there was no man that took them into his house to lodge.	7
ASV	Judges	19	16	And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even: now the man was of the hill-country of Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites.	7
ASV	Judges	19	17	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?	7
ASV	Judges	19	18	And he said unto him, We are passing from Beth-lehem-judah unto the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim; from thence am I, and I went to Beth-lehem-judah: and I am now going to the house of Jehovah; and there is no man that taketh me into his hous	7
ASV	Judges	19	19	Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man that is with thy servants: there is no want of anything.	7
ASV	Judges	19	20	And the old man said, Peace be unto thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.	7
ASV	Judges	19	21	So he brought him into his house, and gave the asses fodder; and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.	7
ASV	Judges	19	22	As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about, beating at the door; and they spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thy house, that	7
ASV	Judges	19	23	And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this folly.	7
ASV	Judges	19	24	Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not any such folly.	7
ASV	Judges	19	25	But the men would not hearken to him: so the man laid hold on his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.	7
ASV	Judges	19	26	Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the mans house where her lord was, till it was light.	7
ASV	Judges	19	27	And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands upon the threshold.	7
ASV	Judges	19	28	And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going; but none answered: then he took her up upon the ass; and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place.	7
ASV	Judges	19	29	And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel.	7
ASV	Judges	19	30	And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider it, take counsel, and speak.	7
ASV	Judges	20	1	Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, with the land of Gilead, unto Jehovah at Mizpah.	7
ASV	Judges	20	2	And the chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.	7
ASV	Judges	20	3	(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpah.) And the children of Israel said, Tell us, how was this wickedness brought to pass?	7
ASV	Judges	20	4	And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was murdered, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.	7
ASV	Judges	20	5	And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about me by night; me they thought to have slain, and my concubine they forced, and she is dead.	7
ASV	Judges	20	6	And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.	7
ASV	Judges	20	7	Behold, ye children of Israel, all of you, give here your advice and counsel.	7
ASV	Judges	20	8	And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn unto his house.	7
ASV	Judges	20	9	But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot;	7
ASV	Judges	20	10	and we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victuals for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the foll	7
ASV	Judges	20	11	So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.	7
ASV	Judges	20	12	And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is come to pass among you?	7
ASV	Judges	20	13	Now therefore deliver up the men, the base fellows, that are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel.	7
ASV	Judges	20	14	And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.	7
ASV	Judges	20	15	And the children of Benjamin were numbered on that day out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.	7
ASV	Judges	20	16	Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at a hair-breadth, and not miss.	7
ASV	Judges	20	17	And the men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.	7
ASV	Judges	20	18	And the children of Israel arose, and went up to Beth-el, and asked counsel of God; and they said, Who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin? And Jehovah said, Judah shall go up first.	7
ASV	Judges	20	19	And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.	7
ASV	Judges	20	20	And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah.	7
ASV	Judges	20	21	And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day twenty and two thousand men.	7
ASV	Judges	20	22	And the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day.	7
ASV	Judges	20	23	And the children of Israel went up and wept before Jehovah until even; and they asked of Jehovah, saying, Shall I again draw nigh to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And Jehovah said, Go up against him.	7
ASV	Judges	20	24	And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.	7
ASV	Judges	20	25	And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.	7
ASV	Judges	20	26	Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto Beth-el, and wept, and sat there before Jehovah, and fasted that day until even; and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah.	7
ASV	Judges	20	27	And the children of Israel asked of Jehovah (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,	7
ASV	Judges	20	28	and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And Jehovah said, Go up; for to-morrow I will deliver him into th	7
ASV	Judges	20	29	And Israel set liers-in-wait against Gibeah round about.	7
ASV	Judges	20	30	And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.	7
ASV	Judges	20	31	And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite and kill of the people, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to Beth-el, and the other to Gibeah, in the field, about	7
ASV	Judges	20	32	And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them away from the city unto the highways.	7
ASV	Judges	20	33	And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and the liers-in-wait of Israel brake forth out of their place, even out of Maareh-geba.	7
ASV	Judges	20	34	And there came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore; but they knew not that evil was close upon them.	7
ASV	Judges	20	35	And Jehovah smote Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred men: all these drew the sword.	7
ASV	Judges	20	36	So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they trusted unto the liers-in-wait whom they had set against Gibeah.	7
ASV	Judges	20	37	And the liers-in-wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers-in-wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.	7
ASV	Judges	20	38	Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers-in-wait was, that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city.	7
ASV	Judges	20	39	And the men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.	7
ASV	Judges	20	40	But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them; and, behold, the whole of the city went up in smoke to heaven.	7
ASV	Judges	20	41	And the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed; for they saw that evil was come upon them.	7
ASV	Judges	20	42	Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle followed hard after them; and they that came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst thereof.	7
ASV	Judges	20	43	They inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trod them down at their resting-place, as far as over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.	7
ASV	Judges	20	44	And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valor.	7
ASV	Judges	20	45	And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men, and followed hard after them unto Gidom, and smote of them two thousand men.	7
ASV	Judges	20	46	So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valor.	7
ASV	Judges	20	47	But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon, and abode in the rock of Rimmon four months.	7
ASV	Judges	20	48	And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city, and the cattle, and all that they found: moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire.	7
ASV	Judges	21	1	Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.	7
ASV	Judges	21	2	And the people came to Beth-el, and sat there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore.	7
ASV	Judges	21	3	And they said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to-day one tribe lacking in Israel?	7
ASV	Judges	21	4	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings.	7
ASV	Judges	21	5	And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up in the assembly unto Jehovah? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up unto Jehovah to Mizpah, saying, He shall surely be put to death.	7
ASV	Judges	21	6	And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.	7
ASV	Judges	21	7	How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by Jehovah that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?	7
ASV	Judges	21	8	And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up unto Jehovah to Mizpah? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.	7
ASV	Judges	21	9	For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there.	7
ASV	Judges	21	10	And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones.	7
ASV	Judges	21	11	And this is the thing that ye shall do: ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.	7
ASV	Judges	21	12	And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, that had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.	7
ASV	Judges	21	13	And the whole congregation sent and spake to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace unto them.	7
ASV	Judges	21	14	And Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.	7
ASV	Judges	21	15	And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that Jehovah had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.	7
ASV	Judges	21	16	Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?	7
ASV	Judges	21	17	And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not blotted out from Israel.	7
ASV	Judges	21	18	Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.	7
ASV	Judges	21	19	And they said, Behold, there is a feast of Jehovah from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.	7
ASV	Judges	21	20	And they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,	7
ASV	Judges	21	21	and see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.	7
ASV	Judges	21	22	And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come to complain unto us, that we will say unto them, Grant them graciously unto us, because we took not for each man of them his wife in battle, neither did ye give them unto them, else would ye now b	7
ASV	Judges	21	23	And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they carried off: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and built the cities, and dwelt in them.	7
ASV	Judges	21	24	And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.	7
ASV	Judges	21	25	In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.	7
ASV	Ruth	1	1	And it came to pass in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem-judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.	8
ASV	Ruth	1	2	And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.	8
ASV	Ruth	1	3	And Elimelech, Naomis husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons.	8
ASV	Ruth	1	4	And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelt there about ten years.	8
ASV	Ruth	1	5	And Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.	8
ASV	Ruth	1	6	Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Jehovah had visited his people in giving them bread.	8
ASV	Ruth	1	7	And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.	8
ASV	Ruth	1	8	And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each of you to her mothers house: Jehovah deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.	8
ASV	Ruth	1	9	Jehovah grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice, and wept.	8
ASV	Ruth	1	10	And they said unto her, Nay, but we will return with thee unto thy people.	8
ASV	Ruth	1	11	And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?	8
ASV	Ruth	1	12	Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should even have a husband to-night, and should also bear sons;	8
ASV	Ruth	1	13	would ye therefore tarry till they were grown? would ye therefore stay from having husbands? nay, my daughters, for it grieveth me much for your sakes, for the hand of Jehovah is gone forth against me.	8
ASV	Ruth	1	14	And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clave unto her.	8
ASV	Ruth	1	15	And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people, and unto her god: return thou after thy sister-in-law.	8
ASV	Ruth	1	16	And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return from following after thee, for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God;	8
ASV	Ruth	1	17	where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: Jehovah do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me.	8
ASV	Ruth	1	18	And when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking unto her.	8
ASV	Ruth	1	19	So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and the women said, Is this Naomi?	8
ASV	Ruth	1	20	And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara; for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.	8
ASV	Ruth	1	21	I went out full, and Jehovah hath brought me home again empty; why call ye me Naomi, seeing Jehovah hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?	8
ASV	Ruth	1	22	So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.	8
ASV	Ruth	2	1	And Naomi had a kinsman of her husbands, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.	8
ASV	Ruth	2	2	And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.	8
ASV	Ruth	2	3	And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on the portion of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.	8
ASV	Ruth	2	4	And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, Jehovah be with you. And they answered him, Jehovah bless thee.	8
ASV	Ruth	2	5	Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?	8
ASV	Ruth	2	6	And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:	8
ASV	Ruth	2	7	And she said, Let me glean, I pray you, and gather after the reapers among the sheaves. So she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, save that she tarried a little in the house.	8
ASV	Ruth	2	8	Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens.	8
ASV	Ruth	2	9	Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.	8
ASV	Ruth	2	10	Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found favor in thy sight, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner?	8
ASV	Ruth	2	11	And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been showed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband; and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people th	8
ASV	Ruth	2	12	Jehovah recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of Jehovah, the God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to take refuge.	8
ASV	Ruth	2	13	Then she said, Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken kindly unto thy handmaid, though I be not as one of thy handmaidens.	8
ASV	Ruth	2	14	And at meal-time Boaz said unto her, Come hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers, and they reached her parched grain, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left thereof.	8
ASV	Ruth	2	15	And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not.	8
ASV	Ruth	2	16	And also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and rebuke her not.	8
ASV	Ruth	2	17	So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.	8
ASV	Ruth	2	18	And she took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed.	8
ASV	Ruth	2	19	And her mother-in-law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where hast thou wrought? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said, The mans name with whom I wrought to-day	8
ASV	Ruth	2	20	And Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Jehovah, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is nigh of kin unto us, one of our near kinsmen.	8
ASV	Ruth	2	21	And Ruth the Moabitess said, Yea, he said unto me, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.	8
ASV	Ruth	2	22	And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, and that they meet thee not in any other field.	8
ASV	Ruth	2	23	So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz, to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.	8
ASV	Ruth	3	1	And Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?	8
ASV	Ruth	3	2	And now is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to-night in the threshing-floor.	8
ASV	Ruth	3	3	Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the threshing-floor, but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.	8
ASV	Ruth	3	4	And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.	8
ASV	Ruth	3	5	And she said unto her, All that thou sayest I will do.	8
ASV	Ruth	3	6	And she went down unto the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.	8
ASV	Ruth	3	7	And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.	8
ASV	Ruth	3	8	And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself; and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.	8
ASV	Ruth	3	9	And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thy handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.	8
ASV	Ruth	3	10	And he said, Blessed be thou of Jehovah, my daughter: thou hast showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.	8
ASV	Ruth	3	11	And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou sayest; for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a worthy woman.	8
ASV	Ruth	3	12	And now it is true that I am a near kinsman; howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.	8
ASV	Ruth	3	13	Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsmans part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as Jehovah li	8
ASV	Ruth	3	14	And she lay at his feet until the morning. And she rose up before one could discern another. For he said, Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor.	8
ASV	Ruth	3	15	And he said, Bring the mantle that is upon thee, and hold it; and she held it; and he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and he went into the city.	8
ASV	Ruth	3	16	And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.	8
ASV	Ruth	3	17	And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said, Go not empty unto thy mother-in-law.	8
ASV	Ruth	3	18	Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he have finished the thing this day.	8
ASV	Ruth	4	1	Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.	8
ASV	Ruth	4	2	And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.	8
ASV	Ruth	4	3	And he said unto the near kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelechs:	8
ASV	Ruth	4	4	And I thought to disclose it unto thee, saying, Buy it before them that sit here, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it besides	8
ASV	Ruth	4	5	Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.	8
ASV	Ruth	4	6	And the near kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: take thou my right of redemption on thee; for I cannot redeem it.	8
ASV	Ruth	4	7	Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the manner of attestation in Israel.	8
ASV	Ruth	4	8	So the near kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thyself. And he drew off his shoe.	8
ASV	Ruth	4	9	And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelechs, and all that was Chilions and Mahlons, of the hand of Naomi.	8
ASV	Ruth	4	10	Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this	8
ASV	Ruth	4	11	And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. Jehovah make the woman that is come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Be	8
ASV	Ruth	4	12	and let thy house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which Jehovah shall give thee of this young woman.	8
ASV	Ruth	4	13	So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in unto her, and Jehovah gave her conception, and she bare a son.	8
ASV	Ruth	4	14	And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be Jehovah, who hath not left thee this day without a near kinsman; and let his name be famous in Israel.	8
ASV	Ruth	4	15	And he shall be unto thee a restorer of life, and a nourisher of thine old age, for thy daughter-in-law, who loveth thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him.	8
ASV	Ruth	4	16	And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.	8
ASV	Ruth	4	17	And the women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.	8
ASV	Ruth	4	18	Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begat Hezron,	8
ASV	Ruth	4	19	and Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,	8
ASV	Ruth	4	20	and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,	8
ASV	Ruth	4	21	and Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,	8
ASV	Ruth	4	22	and Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.	8
ASV	1 Samuel	1	1	Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	2	and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	3	And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice unto Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests unto Jehovah, were there.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	4	And when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	5	but unto Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but Jehovah had shut up her womb.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	6	And her rival provoked her sore, to make her fret, because Jehovah had shut up her womb.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	7	And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of Jehovah, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	8	And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	9	So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting upon his seat by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	10	And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto Jehovah, and wept sore.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	11	And she vowed a vow, and said, O Jehovah of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man-child, then I will give him unto Jehovah all the days of his	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	12	And it came to pass, as she continued praying before Jehovah, that Eli marked her mouth.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	13	Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	14	And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	15	And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Jehovah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	16	Count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman; for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken hitherto.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	17	Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant thy petition that thou hast asked of him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	18	And she said, Let thy handmaid find favor in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat; and her countenance was no more sad.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	19	And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before Jehovah, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Jehovah remembered her.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	20	And it came to pass, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bare a son; and she called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of Jehovah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	21	And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto Jehovah the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	22	But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned; and then I will bring him, that he may appear before Jehovah, and there abide for ever.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	23	And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only Jehovah establish his word. So the woman tarried and gave her son suck, until she weaned him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	24	And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of Jehovah in Shiloh: and the child was young.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	25	And they slew the bullock, and brought the child to Eli.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	26	And she said, Oh, my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto Jehovah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	27	For this child I prayed; and Jehovah hath given me my petition which I asked of him:	9
ASV	1 Samuel	1	28	therefore also I have granted him to Jehovah; as long as he liveth he is granted to Jehovah. And he worshipped Jehovah there.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	1	And Hannah prayed, and said: My heart exulteth in Jehovah; My horn is exalted in Jehovah; My mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; Because I rejoice in thy salvation.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	2	There is none holy as Jehovah; For there is none besides thee, Neither is there any rock like our God.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	3	Talk no more so exceeding proudly; Let not arrogancy come out of your mouth; For Jehovah is a God of knowledge, And by him actions are weighed.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	4	The bows of the mighty men are broken; And they that stumbled are girded with strength.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	5	They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; And they that were hungry have ceased to hunger: Yea, the barren hath borne seven; And she that hath many children languisheth.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	6	Jehovah killeth, and maketh alive: He bringeth down to Sheol, and bringeth up.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	7	Jehovah maketh poor, and maketh rich: He bringeth low, he also lifteth up.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	8	He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, He lifteth up the needy from the dunghill, To make them sit with princes, And inherit the throne of glory: For the pillars of the earth are Jehovahs, And he hath set the world upon them.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	9	He will keep the feet of his holy ones; But the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness; For by strength shall no man prevail.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	10	They that strive with Jehovah shall be broken to pieces; Against them will he thunder in heaven: Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth; And he will give strength unto his king, And exalt the horn of his anointed.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	11	And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto Jehovah before Eli the priest.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	12	Now the sons of Eli were base men; they knew not Jehovah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	13	And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priests servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand;	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	14	and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	15	Yea, before they burnt the fat, the priests servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of thee, but raw.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	16	And if the man said unto him, They will surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would say, Nay, but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	17	And the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah; for the men despised the offering of Jehovah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	18	But Samuel ministered before Jehovah, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	19	Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	20	And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Jehovah give thee seed of this woman for the petition which was asked of Jehovah. And they went unto their own home.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	21	And Jehovah visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before Jehovah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	22	Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	23	And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	24	Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make Jehovahs people to transgress.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	25	If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against Jehovah, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding, they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because Jehovah was minded to slay them.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	26	And the child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Jehovah, and also with men.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	27	And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Did I reveal myself unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaohs house?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	28	and did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up unto mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	29	Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation, and honorest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	30	Therefore Jehovah, the God of Israel, saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now Jehovah saith, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightl	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	31	Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy fathers house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	32	And thou shalt behold the affliction of my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	33	And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thy heart; and all the increase of thy house shall die in the flower of their age.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	34	And this shall be the sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	35	And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	2	36	And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	3	1	And the child Samuel ministered unto Jehovah before Eli. And the word of Jehovah was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	3	2	And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, so that he could not see),	9
ASV	1 Samuel	3	3	and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down to sleep, in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was;	9
ASV	1 Samuel	3	4	that Jehovah called Samuel; and he said, Here am I.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	3	5	And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	3	6	And Jehovah called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	3	7	Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither was the word of Jehovah yet revealed unto him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	3	8	And Jehovah called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah had called the child.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	3	9	Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	3	10	And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	3	11	And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	3	12	In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto the end.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	3	13	For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he restrained them not.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	3	14	And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Elis house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	3	15	And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	3	16	Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	3	17	And he said, What is the thing that Jehovah hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he spake unto thee.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	3	18	And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what seemeth him good.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	3	19	And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	3	20	And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Jehovah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	3	21	And Jehovah appeared again in Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	4	1	And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	4	2	And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines; and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	4	3	And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath Jehovah smitten us to-day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of Shiloh unto us, that it may come among us, and save us out of t	9
ASV	1 Samuel	4	4	So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of hosts, who sitteth above the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	4	5	And when the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	4	6	And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of Jehovah was come into the camp.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	4	7	And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	4	8	Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? these are the gods that smote the Egyptians with all manner of plagues in the wilderness.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	4	9	Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	4	10	And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man to his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	4	11	And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	4	12	And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	4	13	And when he came, lo, Eli was sitting upon his seat by the wayside watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	4	14	And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man hasted, and came and told Eli.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	4	15	Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were set, so that he could not see.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	4	16	And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to-day out of the army. And he said, How went the matter, my son?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	4	17	And he that brought the tidings answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	4	18	And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that Eli feel from off his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	4	19	And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and brought forth; for her pains came upon	9
ASV	1 Samuel	4	20	And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast brought forth a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	4	21	And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel; because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	4	22	And she said, The glory is departed from Israel; for the ark of God is taken.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	5	1	Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	5	2	And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	5	3	And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	5	4	And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands lay cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	5	5	Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagons house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, unto this day.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	5	6	But the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with tumors, even Ashdod and the borders thereof.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	5	7	And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us; for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	5	8	They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God	9
ASV	1 Samuel	5	9	And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of Jehovah was against the city with a very great discomfiture: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great; and tumors brake out upon them.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	5	10	So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	5	11	They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that is slay us not, and our people. For there was a deadly discomfiture throughout al	9
ASV	1 Samuel	5	12	And the men that died not were smitten with the tumors; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	6	1	And the ark of Jehovah was in the country of the Philistines seven months.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	6	2	And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do with the ark of Jehovah? show us wherewith we shall sent it to its place.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	6	3	And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but by all means return him a trespass-offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	6	4	Then said they, What shall be the trespass-offering which we shall return to him? And they said, Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	6	5	Wherefore ye shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	6	6	Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	6	7	Now therefore take and prepare you a new cart, and two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke; and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them;	9
ASV	1 Samuel	6	8	and take the ark of Jehovah, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass-offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	6	9	And see; if it goeth up by the way of its own border to Beth-shemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	6	10	And the men did so, and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home;	9
ASV	1 Samuel	6	11	and they put the ark of Jehovah upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	6	12	And the kine took the straight way by the way to Beth-shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	6	13	And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	6	14	And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered up the kine for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	6	15	And the Levites took down the ark of Jehovah, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt-offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto Jehovah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	6	16	And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	6	17	And these are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass-offering unto Jehovah: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;	9
ASV	1 Samuel	6	18	and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages, even unto the great stone, whereon they set down the ark of Jehovah, which stone remaineth unt	9
ASV	1 Samuel	6	19	And he smote of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of Jehovah, he smote of the people seventy men, and fifty thousand men; and the people mourned, because Jehovah had smitten the people with a great slaughter.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	6	20	And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before Jehovah, this holy God? and to whom shall he go up from us?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	6	21	And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought back the ark of Jehovah; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	7	1	And the men of Kiriath-jearim came, and fetched up the ark of Jehovah, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of Jehovah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	7	2	And it came to pass, from the day that the ark abode in Kiriath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after Jehovah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	7	3	And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto Jehovah with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you, and direct your hearts unto Jehovah, and serve him only; and he will deliver you out	9
ASV	1 Samuel	7	4	Then the children of Israel did put away the Baalim and the Ashtaroth, and served Jehovah only.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	7	5	And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray for you unto Jehovah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	7	6	And they gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before Jehovah, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against Jehovah. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	7	7	And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	7	8	And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto Jehovah our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	7	9	And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt-offering unto Jehovah: and Samuel cried unto Jehovah for Israel; and Jehovah answered him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	7	10	And as Samuel was offering up the burnt-offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel; but Jehovah thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten down before Israel.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	7	11	And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Beth-car.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	7	12	Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath Jehovah helped us.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	7	13	So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more within the border of Israel: and the hand of Jehovah was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	7	14	And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the border thereof did Israel deliver out of the hand of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	7	15	And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	7	16	And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-el and Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those places.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	7	17	And his return was to Ramah, for there was his house; and there he judged Israel: and he built there an altar unto Jehovah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	8	1	And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	8	2	Now the name of his first-born was Joel; and the name of his second, Abijah: they were judges in Beer-sheba.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	8	3	And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted justice.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	8	4	Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah;	9
ASV	1 Samuel	8	5	and they said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	8	6	But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto Jehovah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	8	7	And Jehovah said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not be king over them.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	8	8	According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	8	9	Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit thou shalt protest solemnly unto them, and shalt show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	8	10	And Samuel told all the words of Jehovah unto the people that asked of him a king.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	8	11	And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them unto him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots;	9
ASV	1 Samuel	8	12	and he will appoint them unto him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and he will set some to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	8	13	And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	8	14	And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	8	15	And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	8	16	And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	8	17	He will take the tenth of your flocks: and ye shall be his servants.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	8	18	And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king whom ye shall have chosen you; and Jehovah will not answer you in that day.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	8	19	But the people refused to hearken unto the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay: but we will have a king over us,	9
ASV	1 Samuel	8	20	that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	8	21	And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of Jehovah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	8	22	And Jehovah said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	1	Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valor.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	2	And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a young man and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	3	And the asses of Kish, Sauls father, were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	4	And he passed through the hill-country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found t	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	5	When they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return, lest my father leave off caring for the asses, and be anxious for us.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	6	And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man that is held in honor; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	7	Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	8	And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	9	(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said, Come, and let us go to the seer; for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	10	Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	11	As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	12	And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before thee: make haste now, for he is come to-day into the city; for the people have a sacrifice to-day in the high place:	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	13	as soon as ye are come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he goeth up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that are bidden. Now therefore get yo	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	14	And they went up to the city; and as they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	15	Now Jehovah had revealed unto Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	16	To-morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be prince over my people Israel; and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	17	And when Samuel saw Saul, Jehovah said unto him, Behold, the man of whom I spake to thee! this same shall have authority over my people.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	18	Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seers house is.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	19	And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before me unto the high place, for ye shall eat with me to-day: and in the morning I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thy heart.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	20	And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not they mind on them; for they are found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for thee, and for all thy fathers house?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	21	And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou to me after this manner?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	22	And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest-chamber, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, who were about thirty persons.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	23	And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	24	And the cook took up the thigh, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold, that which hath been reserved! set it before thee and eat; because unto the appointed time hath it been kept for thee, for I said, I have invited	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	25	And when they were come down from the high place into the city, he communed with Saul upon the housetop.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	26	And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	9	27	As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us (and he passed on), but stand thou still first, that I may cause thee to hear the word of God.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	1	Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not that Jehovah hath anointed thee to be prince over his inheritance?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	2	When thou art departed from me to-day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachels sepulchre, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found; and, lo, thy father hath left off caring for the as	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	3	Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the oak of Tabor; and there shall meet thee there three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	4	and they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread, which thou shalt receive of their hand.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	5	After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a timb	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	6	and the Spirit of Jehovah will come mightily upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	7	And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion shall serve thee; for God is with thee.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	8	And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt-offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come unto thee, and show thee what thou shalt do.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	9	And it was so, that, when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	10	And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily upon him, and he prophesied among them.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	11	And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	12	And one of the same place answered and said, And who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	13	And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	14	And Sauls uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses; and when we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	15	And Sauls uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	16	And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But concerning the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	17	And Samuel called the people together unto Jehovah to Mizpah;	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	18	and he said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you:	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	19	but ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saveth you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before Jehovah by your tribes, and by your thousands.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	20	So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	21	And he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken: but when they sought him, he could not be found.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	22	Therefore they asked of Jehovah further, Is there yet a man to come hither? And Jehovah answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the baggage.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	23	And they ran and fetched him thence; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	24	And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom Jehovah hath chosen, that there is none like him along all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, Long live the king.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	25	Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Jehovah. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	26	And Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him the host, whose hearts God had touched.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	10	27	But certain worthless fellows said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no present. But he held his peace.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	11	1	Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	11	2	And Nahash the Ammonite said unto them, On this condition will I make it with you, that all your right eyes be put out; and I will lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	11	3	And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days respite, that we may send messengers unto all the borders of Israel; and then, if there be none to save us, we will come out to thee.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	11	4	Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and spake these words in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	11	5	And, behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the words of the men of Jabesh.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	11	6	And the Spirit of God came mightily upon Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	11	7	And he took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the dread of Jehovah f	9
ASV	1 Samuel	11	8	And he numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	11	9	And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, To-morrow, by the time the sun is hot, ye shall have deliverance. And the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	11	10	Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To-morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	22	15	Have I to-day begun to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute anything unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father; for thy servant knoweth nothing of all this, less or more.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	22	16	And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy fathers house.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	22	17	And the king said unto the guard that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of Jehovah; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew that he fled, and did not disclose it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their	9
ASV	1 Samuel	22	18	And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and he slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	22	19	And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen and asses and sheep, with the edge of the sword.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	22	20	And one of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	22	21	And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain Jehovahs priests.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	22	22	And David said unto Abiathar, I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy fathers house.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	22	23	Abide thou with me, fear not; for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: for with me thou shalt be in safeguard.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	1	And they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and are robbing the threshing-floors.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	2	Therefore David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And Jehovah said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	3	And Davids men said unto him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	4	Then David inquired of Jehovah yet again. And Jehovah answered him, and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	5	And David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and slew them with a great slaughter. So David save the inhabitants of Keilah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	6	And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	7	And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	8	And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	9	And David knew that Saul was devising mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	10	Then said David, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, thy servant hath surely heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	11	Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O Jehovah, the God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And Jehovah said, He will come down.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	12	Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver up to me and my men into the hand of Saul? And Jehovah said, They will deliver thee up.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	13	Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	14	And David abode in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill-country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	11	11	And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and smote the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they that remained were scattered, so tha	9
ASV	1 Samuel	11	12	And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	11	13	And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day; for to-day Jehovah hath wrought deliverance in Israel.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	11	14	Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	11	15	And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before Jehovah in Gilgal; and there they offered sacrifices of peace-offerings before Jehovah; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	1	And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	2	And now, behold, the king walketh before you; and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my youth unto this day.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	3	Here I am: witness against me before Jehovah, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I taken a ransom to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will resto	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	4	And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken aught of any mans hand.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	5	And he said unto them, Jehovah is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found aught in my hand. And they said, He is witness.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	6	And Samuel said unto the people, It is Jehovah that appointed Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	7	Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before Jehovah concerning all the righteous acts of Jehovah, which he did to you and to your fathers.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	8	When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto Jehovah, then Jehovah sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in this place.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	9	But they forgat Jehovah their God; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	10	And they cried unto Jehovah, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken Jehovah, and have served the Baalim and the Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	11	And Jehovah sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side; and ye dwelt in safety.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	12	And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay, but a king shall reign over us; when Jehovah your God was your king.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	13	Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have asked for: and, behold, Jehovah hath set a king over you.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	14	If ye will fear Jehovah, and serve him, and hearken unto his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, and both ye and also the king that reigneth over you be followers of Jehovah your God, well:	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	15	but if ye will not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah, but rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, then will the hand of Jehovah be against you, as it was against your fathers.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	16	Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which Jehovah will do before your eyes.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	17	Is it not wheat harvest to-day? I will call unto Jehovah, that he may send thunder and rain; and ye shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of Jehovah, in asking you a king.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	18	So Samuel called unto Jehovah; and Jehovah sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared Jehovah and Samuel.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	19	And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto Jehovah thy God, that we die not; for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	20	And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not; ye have indeed done all this evil; yet turn not aside from following Jehovah, but serve Jehovah with all your heart:	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	21	and turn ye not aside; for then would ye go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver, for they are vain.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	22	For Jehovah will not forsake his people for his great names sake, because it hath pleased Jehovah to make you a people unto himself.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	23	Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Jehovah in ceasing to pray for you: but I will instruct you in the good and the right way.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	24	Only fear Jehovah, and serve him in truth with all your heart; for consider how great things he hath done for you.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	12	25	But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	13	1	Saul was forty years old when he began to reign; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,	9
ASV	1 Samuel	13	2	Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel, whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the mount of Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	13	3	And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba: and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	13	4	And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	13	5	And the Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth-aven.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	13	6	When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed), then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in coverts, and in pits.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	13	7	Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	13	8	And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	13	9	And Saul said, Bring hither the burnt-offering to me, and the peace-offerings. And he offered the burnt-offering.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	13	10	And it came to pass that, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	13	11	And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash;	9
ASV	1 Samuel	13	12	therefore said I, Now will the Philistines come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not entreated the favor of Jehovah: I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt-offering.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	13	13	And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly; thou hast not kept the commandment of Jehovah thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would Jehovah have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	13	14	But now thy kingdom shall not continue: Jehovah hath sought him a man after his own heart, and Jehovah hath appointed him to be prince over his people, because thou hast not kept that which Jehovah commanded thee.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	13	15	And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	13	16	And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Geba of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	13	17	And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual;	9
ASV	1 Samuel	13	18	and another company turned the way to Beth-horon; and another company turned the way of the border that looketh down upon the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	13	19	Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:	9
ASV	1 Samuel	13	20	but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock;	9
ASV	1 Samuel	13	21	yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to set the goads.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	13	22	So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	13	23	And the garrison of the Philistines went out unto the pass of Michmash.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	1	Now it fell upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armor, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines garrison, that is on yonder side. But he told not his father.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	2	And Saul abode in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate-tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	3	and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabods brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of Jehovah in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	4	And between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	5	The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	6	And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armor, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that Jehovah will work for us; for there is no restraint to Jehovah to save by many or by few.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	7	And his armorbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thy heart: turn thee, behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	8	Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto the men, and we will disclose ourselves unto them.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	9	If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	10	But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up; for Jehovah hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be the sign unto us.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	11	And both of them disclosed themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	12	And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armorbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armorbearer, Come up after me; for Jehovah hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	13	And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armorbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armorbearer slew them after him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	14	And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armorbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrows length in an acre of land.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	15	And there was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled; and the earth quaked: so there was an exceeding great trembling.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	16	And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went hither and thither.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	17	Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armorbearer were not there.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	18	And Saul said unto Ahijah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was there at that time with the children of Israel.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	19	And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thy hand.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	20	And Saul and all the people that were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle: and, behold, every mans sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	21	Now the Hebrews that were with the Philistines as beforetime, and that went up with them into the camp, from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	22	Likewise all the men of Israel that had hid themselves in the hill-country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	23	So Jehovah saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over by Beth-aven.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	24	And the men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until it be evening, and I be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted food.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	25	And all the people came into the forest; and there was honey upon the ground.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	26	And when the people were come unto the forest, behold, the honey dropped: but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	27	But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	28	Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth food this day. And the people were faint.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	29	Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	30	How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to-day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for now hath there been no great slaughter among the Philistines.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	31	And they smote of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very faint;	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	32	and the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people did eat them with the blood.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	33	Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against Jehovah, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, ye have dealt treacherously: roll a great stone unto me this day.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	34	And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against Jehovah in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	35	And Saul built an altar unto Jehovah: the same was the first altar that he built unto Jehovah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	36	And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto Go	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	37	And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	38	And Saul said, Draw nigh hither, all ye chiefs of the people; and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	39	For, as Jehovah liveth, who saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	40	Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	41	Therefore Saul said unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, Show the right. And Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot; but the people escaped.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	42	And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	43	Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did certainly taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and, lo, I must die.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	44	And Saul said, God do so and more also; for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	45	And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? Far from it: as Jehovah liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonat	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	46	Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	47	Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned h	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	48	And he did valiantly, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that despoiled them.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	49	Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the first-born Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	50	and the name of Sauls wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the captain of his host was Abner the son of Ner, Sauls uncle.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	51	And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	14	52	And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	1	And Samuel said unto Saul, Jehovah sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of Jehovah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	2	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way, when he came up out of Egypt.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	3	Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	4	And Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	5	And Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	6	And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	7	And Saul smote the Amalekites, from Havilah as thou goest to Shur, that is before Egypt.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	8	And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	9	But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	10	Then came the word of Jehovah unto Samuel, saying,	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	11	It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And Samuel was wroth; and he cried unto Jehovah all night.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	12	And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a monument, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	13	And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of Jehovah: I have performed the commandment of Jehovah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	14	And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	15	And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto Jehovah thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	16	Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what Jehovah hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	17	And Samuel said, Though thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel? And Jehovah anointed thee king over Israel;	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	18	and Jehovah sent thee on a journey, and said, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	19	Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of Jehovah, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	20	And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of Jehovah, and have gone the way which Jehovah sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	21	But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice unto Jehovah thy God in Gilgal.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	22	And Samuel said, Hath Jehovah as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Jehovah? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	23	For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, he hath also rejected thee from being king.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	24	And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Jehovah, and thy words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	25	Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	26	And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee; for thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	27	And as Samuel turned about to go away, Saul laid hold upon the skirt of his robe, and it rent.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	28	And Samuel said unto him, Jehovah hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of thine, that is better than thou.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	29	And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	30	Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah thy God.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	31	So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped Jehovah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	32	Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him cheerfully. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	33	And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before Jehovah in Gilgal.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	34	Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	15	35	And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Jehovah repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	16	1	And Jehovah said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go: I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite; for I have provided me a king among his sons.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	16	2	And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And Jehovah said, Take a heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to Jehovah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	16	3	And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	16	4	And Samuel did that which Jehovah spake, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, Comest thou peaceably?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	16	5	And he said, Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice unto Jehovah: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	16	6	And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely Jehovahs anointed is before him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	16	7	But Jehovah said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him: for Jehovah seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but Jehovah looketh on the heart.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	16	8	Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath Jehovah chosen this.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	16	9	Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath Jehovah chosen this.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	16	10	And Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Jehovah hath not chosen these.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	16	11	And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he is keeping the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he come hither.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	16	12	And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look upon. And Jehovah said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	16	13	Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	16	14	Now the Spirit of Jehovah departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Jehovah troubled him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	16	15	And Sauls servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	16	16	Let our lord now command thy servants, that are before thee, to seek out a man who is a skilful player on the harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	16	17	And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	16	18	Then answered one of the young men, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that is skilful in playing, and a mighty man of valor, and a man of war, and prudent in speech, and a comely person; and Jehovah is with him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	16	19	Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, who is with the sheep.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	16	20	And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	16	21	And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armorbearer.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	16	22	And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favor in my sight.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	16	23	And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	1	Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongeth to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	2	And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the vale of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	3	And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	4	And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	5	And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	6	And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	7	And the staff of his spear was like a weavers beam; and his spears head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and his shield-bearer went before him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	8	And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	9	If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	10	And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	11	And when Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	12	Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man was an old man in the days of Saul, stricken in years among men.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	13	And the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the first-born, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	14	And David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	15	Now David went to and fro from Saul to feed his fathers sheep at Beth-lehem.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	16	And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	17	And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to thy brethren;	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	18	and bring these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	19	Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the vale of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	20	And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the place of the wagons, as the host which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	21	And Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	22	And David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and saluted his brethren.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	23	And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	24	And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	25	And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his fathers house f	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	26	And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	27	And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	28	And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliabs anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why art thou come down? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thy he	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	29	And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	30	And he turned away from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	31	And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	32	And David said to Saul, Let no mans heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	33	And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	34	And David said unto Saul, Thy servant was keeping his fathers sheep; and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock,	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	35	I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth; and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	36	Thy servant smote both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	37	And David said, Jehovah that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and Jehovah shall be with thee.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	38	And Saul clad David with his apparel, and he put a helmet of brass upon his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	39	And David girded his sword upon his apparel, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	40	And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherds bag which he had, even in his wallet; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	41	And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	42	And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a fair countenance.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	43	And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	44	And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the birds of the heavens, and to the beasts of the field.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	45	Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin: but I come to thee in the name of Jehovah of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	46	This day will Jehovah deliver thee into my hand; and I will smite thee, and take thy head from off thee; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day unto the birds of the heavens, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all t	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	47	and that all this assembly may know that Jehovah saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is Jehovahs, and he will give you into our hand.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	48	And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	49	And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead; and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell upon his face to the earth.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	50	So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	51	Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	52	And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou comest to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	53	And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	54	And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	55	And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	56	And the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling is.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	57	And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	17	58	And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	1	And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	2	And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his fathers house.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	3	Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	4	And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his apparel, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	5	And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and it was good in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Sauls servants.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	6	And it came to pass as they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with timbrels, with joy, and with instruments of music.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	7	And the women sang one to another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	8	And Saul was very wroth, and this saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	9	And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	10	And it came to pass on the morrow, that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as he did day by day. And Saul had his spear in his hand;	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	11	and Saul cast the spear; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall. And David avoided out of his presence twice.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	12	And Saul was afraid of David, because Jehovah was with him, and was departed from Saul.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	13	Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	14	And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and Jehovah was with him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	15	And when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood in awe of him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	16	But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	17	And Saul said to David, Behold, my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight Jehovahs battles. For Saul said, Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	18	And David said unto Saul, Who am I, and what is my life, or my fathers family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	19	But it came to pass at the time when Merab, Sauls daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	20	And Michal, Sauls daughter, loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	21	And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law a second time.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	22	And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the kings son-in-law.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	23	And Sauls servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be the kings son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	24	And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	25	And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the kings enemies. Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	26	And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the kings son-in-law. And the days were not expired;	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	27	and David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the kings son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	28	And Saul saw and knew that Jehovah was with David; and Michal, Sauls daughter, loved him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	29	And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was Davids enemy continually.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	18	30	Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, as often as they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	1	And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should slay David. But Jonathan, Sauls son, delighted much in David.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	2	And Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to slay thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself in the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	3	and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and if I see aught, I will tell thee.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	4	And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	5	for he put his life in his hand, and smote the Philistine, and Jehovah wrought a great victory for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice; wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	6	And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As Jehovah liveth, he shall not be put to death.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	7	And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as beforetime.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	8	And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	9	And an evil spirit from Jehovah was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing with his hand.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	10	And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Sauls presence, and he smote the spear into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	11	And Saul sent messengers unto Davids house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal, Davids wife, told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to-night, to-morrow thou wilt be slain.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	12	So Michal let David down through the window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	13	And Michal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats hair at the head thereof, and covered it with the clothes.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	14	And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	15	And Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	16	And when the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goats hair at the head thereof.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	17	And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me thus, and let mine enemy go, so that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	18	Now David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	19	And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	20	And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	21	And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	22	Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	23	And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God came upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	19	24	And he also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	1	And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	2	And he said unto him, Far from it; thou shalt not die: behold, my father doeth nothing either great or small, but that he discloseth it unto me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	3	And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father knoweth well that I have found favor in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	4	Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	5	And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to-morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	6	If thy father miss me at all, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Beth-lehem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	7	If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be wroth, then know that evil is determined by him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	8	Therefore deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of Jehovah with thee: but if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	9	And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	10	Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me if perchance thy father answer thee roughly?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	11	And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	12	And Jonathan said unto David, Jehovah, the God of Israel, be witness: when I have sounded my father about this time to-morrow, or the third day, behold, if there be good toward David, shall I not then send unto thee, and disclose it unto thee?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	13	Jehovah do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do thee evil, if I disclose it not unto thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and Jehovah be with thee, as he hath been with my father.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	14	And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the lovingkindness of Jehovah, that I die not;	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	15	but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever; no, not when Jehovah hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	16	So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, And Jehovah will require it at the hand of Davids enemies.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	17	And Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	18	Then Jonathan said unto him, To-morrow is the new moon: and thou wilt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	19	And when thou hast stayed three days, thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	20	And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	21	And, behold, I will send the lad, saying, Go, find the arrows. If I say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee; take them, and come; for there is peace to thee and no hurt, as Jehovah liveth.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	22	But if I say thus unto the boy, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way; for Jehovah hath sent thee away.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	23	And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, Jehovah is between thee and me for ever.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	24	So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat food.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	25	And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Sauls side: but Davids place was empty.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	26	Nevertheless Saul spake not anything that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	27	And it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon, which was the second day, that Davids place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to-day?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	28	And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem:	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	29	and he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favor in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he is not come u	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	30	Then Sauls anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of a perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own shame, and unto the shame of thy mothers nakedness?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	31	For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	32	And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore should he be put to death? what hath he done?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	33	And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him; whereby Jonathan knew that is was determined of his father to put David to death.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	34	So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	35	And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	36	And he said unto his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	37	And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	38	And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathans lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	39	But the lad knew not anything: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	40	And Jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	41	And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	20	42	And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of Jehovah, saying, Jehovah shall be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed, for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	21	1	Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	21	2	And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know anything of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed the young men to such and such a	9
ASV	1 Samuel	21	3	Now therefore what is under thy hand? give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatsoever there is present.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	21	4	And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	21	5	And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days; when I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey; how much more then to-day shall their vessels be	9
ASV	1 Samuel	21	6	So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the showbread, that was taken from before Jehovah, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	21	7	Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Jehovah; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chiefest of the herdsmen that belonged to Saul.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	21	8	And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thy hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the kings business required haste.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	21	9	And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the vale of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it; for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none l	9
ASV	1 Samuel	21	10	And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	21	11	And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	21	12	And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	21	13	And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	21	14	Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad; wherefore then have ye brought him to me?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	21	15	Do I lack madmen, that ye have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	22	1	David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave of Adullam: and when his brethren and all his fathers house heard it, they went down thither to him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	22	2	And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	22	3	And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	22	4	And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the stronghold.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	22	5	And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the stronghold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	22	6	And Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him: now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk-tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	22	7	And Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,	9
ASV	1 Samuel	22	8	that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that discloseth to me when my son maketh a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or discloseth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, t	9
ASV	1 Samuel	22	9	Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	22	10	And he inquired of Jehovah for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	22	11	Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his fathers house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	22	12	And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	22	13	And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	22	14	Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who among all thy servants is so faithful as David, who is the kings son-in-law, and is taken into thy council, and is honorable in thy house?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	15	And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	16	And Jonathan, Sauls son, arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	17	And he said unto him, Fear not; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	18	And they two made a covenant before Jehovah: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	19	Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	20	Now therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him up into the kings hand.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	21	And Saul said, Blessed be ye of Jehovah; for ye have had compassion on me.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	22	Go, I pray you, make yet more sure, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there; for it is told me that he dealeth very subtly.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	23	See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me of a certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Jud	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	24	And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of the desert.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	25	And Saul and his men went to seek him. And they told David: wherefore he came down to the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	26	And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	27	But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have made a raid upon the land.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	28	So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	23	29	And David went up from thence, and dwelt in the strongholds of En-gedi.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	24	1	And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	24	2	Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	24	3	And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet. Now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	24	4	And the men of David said unto him, Behold, the day of which Jehovah said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thy hand, and thou shalt do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Sauls robe privily.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	24	5	And it came to pass afterward, that Davids heart smote him, because he had cut off Sauls skirt.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	24	6	And he said unto his men, Jehovah forbid that I should do this thing unto my lord, Jehovahs anointed, to put forth my hand against him, seeing he is Jehovahs anointed.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	24	7	So David checked his men with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	24	8	David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and did obeisance.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	24	9	And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearkenest thou to mens words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	24	10	Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that Jehovah had delivered thee to-day into my hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee; but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is Jehovahs anointed.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	24	11	Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against thee, though th	9
ASV	1 Samuel	24	12	Jehovah judge between me and thee, and Jehovah avenge me of thee; but my hand shall not be upon thee.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	24	13	As saith the proverb of the ancients, Out of the wicked cometh forth wickedness; but my hand shall not be upon thee.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	24	14	After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	24	15	Jehovah therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	24	16	And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	24	17	And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I; for thou hast rendered unto me good, whereas I have rendered unto thee evil.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	24	18	And thou hast declared this day how that thou hast dealt well with me, forasmuch as when Jehovah had delivered me up into thy hand, thou killedst me not.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	24	19	For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore Jehovah reward thee good for that which thou hast done unto me this day.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	24	20	And now, behold, I know that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	24	21	Swear now therefore unto me by Jehovah, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my fathers house.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	24	22	And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the stronghold.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	1	And Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	2	And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	3	Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail; and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	4	And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	5	And David sent ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	6	and thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be unto thee, and peace be to thy house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	7	And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: thy shepherds have now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was there aught missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	8	Ask thy young men, and they will tell thee: wherefore let the young men find favor in thine eyes; for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thy hand, unto thy servants, and to thy son David.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	9	And when Davids young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	10	And Nabal answered Davids servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there are many servants now-a-days that break away every man from his master.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	11	Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men of whom I know not whence they are?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	12	So Davids young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to all these words.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	13	And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the baggage.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	14	But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabals wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed at them.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	15	But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields:	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	16	they were a wall unto us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	17	Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house: for he is such a worthless fellow, that one cannot speak to him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	18	Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched grain, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	19	And she said unto her young men, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	20	And it was so, as she rode on her ass, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that, behold, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	21	Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath returned me evil for good.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	22	God do so unto the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light so much as one man-child.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	23	And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and alighted from her ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	24	And she fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me be the iniquity; and let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine ears, and hear thou the words of thy handmaid.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	25	Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thy handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	26	Now therefore, my lord, as Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing Jehovah hath withholden thee from bloodguiltiness, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now therefore let thine enemies, and them that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	27	And now this present which thy servant hath brought unto my lord, let it be given unto the young men that follow my lord.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	28	Forgive, I pray thee, the trespass of thy handmaid: for Jehovah will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fighteth the battles of Jehovah; and evil shall not be found in thee all thy days.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	29	And though men be risen up to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul, yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with Jehovah thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as from the hollow of a sling.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	30	And it shall come to pass, when Jehovah shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee prince over Israel,	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	31	that this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood without cause, or that my lord hath avenged himself. And when Jehovah shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thy handmaid.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	32	And David said to Abigail, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me:	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	33	and blessed be thy discretion, and blessed be thou, that hast kept me this day from bloodguiltiness, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	34	For in very deed, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, liveth, who hath withholden me from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light so much as one man-child.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	35	So David received of her hand that which she had brought him: and he said unto her, Go up in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	36	And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabals heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	37	And it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	38	And it came to pass about ten days after, that Jehovah smote Nabal, so that he died.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	39	And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be Jehovah, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept back his servant from evil: and the evil-doing of Nabal hath Jehovah returned upon his own head. And Da	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	40	And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David hath sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	41	And she arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, Behold, thy handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	42	And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	43	David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they became both of them his wives.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	25	44	Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, Davids wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	1	And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	2	Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	3	And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	4	David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come of a certainty.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	5	And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped round about him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	6	Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	7	So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay round about him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	8	Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered up thine enemy into thy hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not smite him the second time.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	9	And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not; for who can put forth his hand against Jehovahs anointed, and be guiltless?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	10	And David said, As Jehovah liveth, Jehovah will smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle and perish.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	11	Jehovah forbid that I should put forth my hand against Jehovahs anointed: but now take, I pray thee, the spear that is at his head, and the cruse of water, and let us go.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	12	So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Sauls head; and they gat them away: and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from Jehovah was fallen upon them.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	13	Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them;	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	14	and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	15	And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept watch over thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	16	This thing is not good that thou hast done. As Jehovah liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept watch over your lord, Jehovahs anointed. And now see where the kings spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his head.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	17	And Saul knew Davids voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	18	And he said, Wherefore doth my lord pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in my hand?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	19	Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it be Jehovah that hath stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if it be the children of men, cursed be they before Jehovah: for they have driven me out	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	20	Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of Jehovah: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	21	Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David; for I will no more do thee harm, because my life was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	22	And David answered and said, Behold the spear, O king! let then one of the young men come over and fetch it.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	23	And Jehovah will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; forasmuch as Jehovah delivered thee into my hand to-day, and I would not put forth my hand against Jehovahs anointed.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	24	And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of Jehovah, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	26	25	Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do mightily, and shalt surely prevail. So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	27	1	And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel: so shall	9
ASV	1 Samuel	27	2	And David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men that were with him, unto Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	27	3	And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabals wife.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	27	4	And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	27	5	And David said unto Achish, If now I have found favor in thine eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	27	6	Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	27	7	And the number of the days that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	27	8	And David and his men went up, and made a raid upon the Geshurites, and the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those nations were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	27	9	And David smote the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel; and he returned, and came to Achish.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	27	10	And Achish said, Against whom have ye made a raid to-day? And David said, Against the South of Judah, and against the South of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	27	11	And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell of us, saying, So did David, and so hath been his manner all the while he hath dwelt in the country of the Philistines.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	27	12	And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	1	And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their hosts together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me in the host, thou and thy men.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	2	And David said to Achish, Therefore thou shalt know what thy servant will do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of my head for ever.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	3	Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	4	And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	5	And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	6	And when Saul inquired of Jehovah, Jehovah answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	7	Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at En-dor.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	8	And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, Divine unto me, I pray thee, by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whomsoever I shall name unto thee.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	9	And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	10	And Saul sware to her by Jehovah, saying, As Jehovah liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	11	Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	12	And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	13	And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what seest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	14	And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a robe. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	15	And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	16	And Samuel said, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing Jehovah is departed from thee, and is become thine adversary?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	17	And Jehovah hath done unto thee, as he spake by me: and Jehovah hath rent the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbor, even to David.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	18	Because thou obeyedst not the voice of Jehovah, and didst not execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath Jehovah done this thing unto thee this day.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	19	Moreover Jehovah will deliver Israel also with thee into the hand of the Philistines; and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: Jehovah will deliver the host of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	20	Then Saul fell straightway his full length upon the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	21	And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thy handmaid hath hearkened unto thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	22	Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	23	But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	24	And the woman had a fatted calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:	9
ASV	1 Samuel	28	25	and she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	29	1	Now the Philistines gathered together all their hosts to Aphek: and the Israelites encamped by the fountain which is in Jezreel.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	29	2	And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands; and David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	29	3	Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who hath been with me these days, or rather these years, and I have found	9
ASV	1 Samuel	29	4	But he princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he	9
ASV	1 Samuel	29	5	Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	29	6	Then Achish called David, and said unto him, As Jehovah liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: never	9
ASV	1 Samuel	29	7	Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	29	8	And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been before thee unto this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?	9
ASV	1 Samuel	29	9	And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	29	10	Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of thy lord that are come with thee; and as soon as ye are up early in the morning, and have light, depart.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	29	11	So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	1	And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid upon the South, and upon Ziklag, and had smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire,	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	2	and had taken captive the women and all that were therein, both small and great: they slew not any, but carried them off, and went their way.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	3	And when David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captive.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	4	Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	5	And Davids two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	6	And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David strengthened himself in Jehovah his God.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	7	And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	8	And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, If I pursue after this troop, shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue; for thou shalt surely overtake them, and shalt without fail recover all.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	9	So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	10	But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	11	And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they gave him water to drink.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	12	And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	13	And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	14	We made a raid upon the South of the Cherethites, and upon that which belongeth to Judah, and upon the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	15	And David said to him, Wilt thou bring me down to this troop? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this troop.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	16	And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the ground, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	17	And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, who rode upon camels and fled.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	18	And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	19	And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything that they had taken to them: David brought back all.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	20	And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other cattle, and said, This is Davids spoil.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	21	And David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to abide at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the p	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	22	Then answered all the wicked men and base fellows, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that he may lead them	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	23	Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which Jehovah hath given unto us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	24	And who will hearken unto you in this matter? for as his share is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his share be that tarrieth by the baggage: they shall share alike.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	25	And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	26	And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold, a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of Jehovah:	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	27	To them that were in Beth-el, and to them that were in Ramoth of the South, and to them that were in Jattir,	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	28	and to them that were in Aroer, and to them that were in Siphmoth, and to them that were in Eshtemoa,	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	29	and to them that were in Racal, and to them that were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them that were in the cities of the Kenites,	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	30	and to them that were in Hormah, and to them that were in Bor-ashan, and to them that were in Athach,	9
ASV	1 Samuel	30	31	and to them that were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	31	1	Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	31	2	And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	31	3	And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	31	4	Then said Saul to his armorbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armorbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	31	5	And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died with him.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	31	6	So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armorbearer, and all his men, that same day together.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	31	7	And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in the	9
ASV	1 Samuel	31	8	And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	31	9	And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the tidings unto the house of their idols, and to the people.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	31	10	And they put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	31	11	And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul,	9
ASV	1 Samuel	31	12	all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.	9
ASV	1 Samuel	31	13	And they took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk-tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.	9
ASV	2 Samuel	1	1	And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	2	it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	3	And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	4	And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	5	And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	6	And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	7	And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	8	And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	9	And he said unto me, Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and slay me; for anguish hath taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	10	So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	11	Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	12	and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	13	And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	14	And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy Jehovahs anointed?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	15	And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him, so that he died.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	16	And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain Jehovahs anointed.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	17	And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	18	(and he bade them teach the children of Judah the song of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	19	Thy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places! How are the mighty fallen!	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	20	Tell it not in Gath, Publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	21	Ye mountains of Gilboa, Let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of offerings: For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	22	From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan turned not back, And the sword of Saul returned not empty.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	23	Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, And in their death they were not divided: They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	24	Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, Who clothed you in scarlet delicately, Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	25	How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain upon thy high places.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	26	I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: Very pleasant hast thou been unto me: Thy love to me was wonderful, Passing the love of women.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	1	27	How are the mighty fallen, And the weapons of war perished!	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	1	And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And Jehovah said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	2	So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	3	And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	4	And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, The men of Jabesh-gilead were they that buried Saul.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	5	And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of Jehovah, that ye have showed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	6	And now Jehovah show lovingkindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	7	Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be ye valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	8	Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Sauls host, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	9	and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	10	Ish-bosheth, Sauls son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	11	And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	12	And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	13	And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	14	And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men, I pray thee, arise and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	15	Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	16	And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellows side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	17	And the battle was very sore that day: and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	18	And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	19	And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	20	Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Is it thou, Asahel? And he answered, It is I.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	21	And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	22	And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	23	Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place whe	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	24	But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	25	And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	26	Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	27	And Joab said, As God liveth, if thou hadst not spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone away, nor followed every one his brother.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	28	So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	29	And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	30	And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of Davids servants nineteen men and Asahel.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	31	But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abners men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	2	32	And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and the day brake upon them at Hebron.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	1	Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: and David waxed stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	2	And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his first-born was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	3	and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	4	and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	5	and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, Davids wife. These were born to David in Hebron.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	6	And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	7	Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my fathers concubine?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	8	Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dogs head that belongeth to Judah? This day do I show kindness unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of Da	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	9	God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Jehovah hath sworn to David, I do not even so to him;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	10	to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	11	And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	12	And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	13	And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee; but one thing I require of thee: that is, thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal, Sauls daughter, when thou comest to see my face.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	14	And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Sauls son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	15	And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	16	And her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return: and he returned.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	17	And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, In times past ye sought for David to be king over you:	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	18	now then do it; for Jehovah hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	19	And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	20	So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	21	And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	22	And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	23	When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	24	Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	25	Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	26	And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	27	And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	28	And afterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before Jehovah for ever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner:	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	29	let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his fathers house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth by the sword, or that lacketh bread.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	30	So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	31	And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David followed the bier.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	32	And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	33	And the king lamented for Abner, and said, Should Abner die as a fool dieth?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	34	Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: As a man falleth before the children of iniquity, so didst thou fall. And all the people wept again over him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	35	And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David sware, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or aught else, till the sun be down.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	36	And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	37	So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	38	And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	3	39	And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me: Jehovah reward the evil-doer according to his wickedness.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	4	1	And when Ish-bosheth, Sauls son, heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	4	2	And Ish-bosheth, Sauls son, had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin:	10
ASV	2 Samuel	4	3	and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners there until this day).	10
ASV	2 Samuel	4	4	Now Jonathan, Sauls son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel; and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became la	10
ASV	2 Samuel	4	5	And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, as he took his rest at noon.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	4	6	And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him in the body: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	4	7	Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	4	8	And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold, the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, thine enemy, who sought thy life; and Jehovah hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	4	9	And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	4	10	when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his tidings.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	4	11	How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	4	12	And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	1	Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	2	In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was thou that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and Jehovah said to thee, Thou shalt be shepherd of my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	3	So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah: and they anointed David king over Israel.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	4	David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	5	In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	6	And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither; thinking, David cannot come in hither.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	7	Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	8	And David said on that day, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites, let him get up to the watercourse, and smite the lame and the blind, that are hated of Davids soul. Wherefore they say, There are the blind and the lame; he cannot come into the house.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	9	And David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	10	And David waxed greater and greater; for Jehovah, the God of hosts, was with him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	11	And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	12	And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israels sake.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	13	And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	14	And these are the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	15	and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	16	and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	17	And when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	18	Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	19	And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said unto David, Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into thy hand.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	20	And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said, Jehovah hath broken mine enemies before me, like the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	21	And they left their images there; and David and his men took them away.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	22	And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	23	And when David inquired of Jehovah, he said, Thou shalt not go up: make a circuit behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	24	And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then is Jehovah gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	5	25	And David did so, as Jehovah commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gezer.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	6	1	And David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	6	2	And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him, from Baale-judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, which is called by the Name, even the name of Jehovah of hosts that sitteth above the cherubim.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	6	3	And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	6	4	And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	6	5	And David and all the house of Israel played before Jehovah with all manner of instruments made of fir-wood, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with castanets, and with cymbals.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	6	6	And when they came to the threshing-floor of Nacon, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen stumbled.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	6	7	And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	6	8	And David was displeased, because Jehovah had broken forth upon Uzzah; and he called that place Perez-uzzah, unto this day.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	6	9	And David was afraid of Jehovah that day; and he said, How shall the ark of Jehovah come unto me?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	6	10	So David would not remove the ark of Jehovah unto him into the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	6	11	And the ark of Jehovah remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months: and Jehovah blessed Obed-edom, and all his house.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	6	12	And it was told king David, saying, Jehovah hath blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. And David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with joy.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	6	13	And it was so, that, when they that bare the ark of Jehovah had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	6	14	And David danced before Jehovah with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	6	15	So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Jehovah with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	6	16	And it was so, as the ark of Jehovah came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before Jehovah; and she despised him in her heart.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	6	17	And they brought in the ark of Jehovah, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	6	18	And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah of hosts.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	6	19	And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a portion of flesh, and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed every one to his house.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	6	20	Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to-day, who uncovered himself to-day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows	10
ASV	2 Samuel	6	21	And David said unto Michal, It was before Jehovah, who chose me above thy father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of Jehovah, over Israel: therefore will I play before Jehovah.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	6	22	And I will be yet more vile than this, and will be base in mine own sight: but of the handmaids of whom thou hast spoken, of them shall I be had in honor.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	6	23	And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	1	And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house, and Jehovah had given him rest from all his enemies round about,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	2	that the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	3	And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thy heart; for Jehovah is with thee.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	4	And it came to pass the same night, that the word of Jehovah came unto Nathan, saying,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	5	Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah, Shalt thou build me a house for me to dwell in?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	6	for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	7	In all places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel, spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	8	Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people, over Israel;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	9	and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a great name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	10	And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	11	and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will cause thee to rest from all thine enemies. Moreover Jehovah telleth thee that Jehovah will make thee a house.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	12	When thy days are fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, that shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	13	He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	14	I will be his father, and he shall be my son: if he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	15	but my lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	16	And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made sure for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	17	According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	18	Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Lord Jehovah, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	19	And this was yet a small thing in thine eyes, O Lord Jehovah; but thou hast spoken also of thy servants house for a great while to come; and this too after the manner of men, O Lord Jehovah!	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	20	And what can David say more unto thee? for thou knowest thy servant, O Lord Jehovah.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	21	For thy words sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make thy servant know it.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	22	Wherefore thou art great, O Jehovah God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	23	And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, and to make him a name, and to do great things for you, and terrible things for thy land, before thy people, whom thou redeemest to t	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	24	And thou didst establish to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	25	And now, O Jehovah God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, confirm thou it for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	26	And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is God over Israel; and the house of thy servant David shall be established before thee.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	27	For thou, O Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	28	And now, O Lord Jehovah, thou art God, and thy words are truth, and thou hast promised this good thing unto thy servant:	10
ASV	2 Samuel	7	29	now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee; for thou, O Lord Jehovah, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	8	1	And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took the bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	8	2	And he smote Moab, and measured them with the line, making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. And the Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	8	3	David smote also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his dominion at the River.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	8	4	And David took from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David hocked all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	8	5	And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadadezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	8	6	Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	8	7	And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	8	8	And from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	8	9	And when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	8	10	then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass	10
ASV	2 Samuel	8	11	These also did king David dedicate unto Jehovah, with the silver and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	8	12	of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	8	13	And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting the Syrians in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	8	14	And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	8	15	And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice and righteousness unto all his people.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	8	16	And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	8	17	and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Seraiah was scribe;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	8	18	and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and Davids sons were chief ministers.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	9	1	And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathans sake?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	9	2	And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him unto David; and the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	9	3	And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, who is lame of his feet.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	9	4	And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	9	5	Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	9	6	And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came unto David, and fell on his face, and did obeisance. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold, thy servant!	10
ASV	2 Samuel	9	7	And David said unto him, Fear not; for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy fathers sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	9	8	And he did obeisance, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	9	9	Then the king called to Ziba, Sauls servant, and said unto him, All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given unto thy masters son.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	9	10	And thou shalt till the land for him, thou, and thy sons, and thy servants; and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy masters son may have bread to eat: but Mephibosheth thy masters son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and t	10
ASV	2 Samuel	9	11	Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king commandeth his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the kings sons.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	9	12	And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	9	13	So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem; for he did eat continually at the kings table. And he was lame in both his feet.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	10	1	And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	10	2	And David said, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness unto me. So David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father. And Davids servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	10	3	But the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, in that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David sent his servants unto thee to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overth	10
ASV	2 Samuel	10	4	So Hanun took Davids servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	10	5	When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	10	6	And when the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and the men of Tob twe	10
ASV	2 Samuel	10	7	And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	10	8	And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate: and the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	10	9	Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:	10
ASV	2 Samuel	10	10	And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	10	11	And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	10	12	Be of good courage, and let us play the man for ou people, and for the cities of our God: and Jehovah do that which seemeth him good.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	10	13	So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	10	14	And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	10	15	And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they gathered themselves together.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	10	16	And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	10	17	And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	10	18	And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians the men of seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, so that he died there.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	10	19	And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	1	And it came to pass, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go out to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	2	And it came to pass at eventide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the kings house: and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	3	And David send and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	4	And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned unto her house.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	5	And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, I am with child.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	6	And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	7	And when Uriah was come unto him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	8	And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the kings house, and there followed him a mess of food from the king.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	9	But Uriah slept at the door of the kings house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	10	And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Art thou not come from a journey? wherefore didst thou not go down unto thy house?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	11	And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in booths; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	12	And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to-day also, and to-morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	13	And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	14	And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	15	And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	16	And it came to pass, when Joab kept watch upon the city, that he assigned Uriah unto the place where he knew that valiant men were.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	17	And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people, even of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	18	Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	19	and he charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling all the things concerning the war unto the king,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	20	it shall be that, if the kings wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore went ye so nigh unto the city to fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	21	who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast an upper millstone upon him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? why went ye so nigh the wall? then shalt thou say, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	22	So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	23	And the messenger said unto David, The men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entrance of the gate.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	24	And the shooters shot at thy servants from off the wall; and some of the kings servants are dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	25	Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another; make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	26	And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	11	27	And when the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Jehovah.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	1	And Jehovah sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	2	The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	3	but the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own morsel, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daug	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	4	And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him, but took the poor mans lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	5	And Davids anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As Jehovah liveth, the man that hath done this is worthy to die:	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	6	and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	7	And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	8	and I gave thee thy masters house, and thy masters wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would have added unto thee such and such things.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	9	Wherefore hast thou despised the word of Jehovah, to do that which is evil in his sight? thou hast smitten Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	10	Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house, because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	11	Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house; and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	12	For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	13	And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan said unto David, Jehovah also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	14	Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of Jehovah to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	15	And Nathan departed unto his house. And Jehovah struck the child that Uriahs wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	16	David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	17	And the elders of his house arose, and stood beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	18	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he hearkened not unto our voice: how will he th	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	19	But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	20	Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel; and he came into the house of Jehovah, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	21	Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	22	And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who knoweth whether Jehovah will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	23	But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	24	And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon. And Jehovah loved him;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	25	and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, for Jehovahs sake.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	26	Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	27	And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah; yea, I have taken the city of waters.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	28	Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	29	And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	30	And he took the crown of their king from off his head; and the weight thereof was a talent of gold, and in it were precious stones; and it was set on Davids head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	12	31	And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the pe	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	1	And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	2	And Amnon was so vexed that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything unto her.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	3	But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, Davids brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	4	And he said unto him, Why, O son of the king, art thou thus lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absaloms sister.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	5	And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and feign thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	6	So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, Let her sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	7	Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnons house, and dress him food.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	8	So Tamar went to her brother Amnons house; and he was laid down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	9	And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	10	And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	11	And when she had brought them near unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come, lie with me, my sister.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	12	And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	13	And I, whither shall I carry my shame? and as for thee, thou wilt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	14	Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	15	Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	16	And she said unto him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is worse than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	17	Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	18	And she had a garment of divers colors upon her; for with such robes were the kings daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	19	And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	20	And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but now hold thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; take not this thing to heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absaloms house.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	21	But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	22	And Absalom spake unto Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	23	And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the kings sons.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	24	And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheep-shearers; let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	25	And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	26	Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	27	But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the kings sons go with him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	28	And Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now, when Amnons heart is merry with wine; and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon, then kill him; fear not; have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	29	And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the kings sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	30	And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the kings sons, and there is not one of them left.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	31	Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	32	And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, Davids brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the kings sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he fo	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	33	Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the kings sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	34	But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill-side behind him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	35	And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the kings sons are come: as thy servant said, so it is.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	36	And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the kings sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	37	But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	38	So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	13	39	And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	1	Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the kings heart was toward Absalom.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	2	And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that hath a long time mourned for the dead	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	3	and go in to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	4	And when the woman of Tekoa spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	5	And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, Of a truth I am a widow, and my husband is dead.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	6	And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and killed him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	7	And, behold, the whole family is risen against thy handmaid, and they say, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew, and so destroy the heir also. Thus will they quench my coal which is left, and wi	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	8	And the king said unto the woman, Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	9	And the woman of Tekoa said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my fathers house; and the king and his throne be guiltless.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	10	And the king said, Whosoever saith aught unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	11	Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember Jehovah thy God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	12	Then the woman said, Let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak a word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	13	And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou devised such a thing against the people of God? for in speaking this word the king is as one that is guilty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished one.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	14	For we must needs die, and are as water split on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God take away life, but deviseth means, that he that is banished be not an outcast from him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	15	Now therefore seeing that I am come to speak this word unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	16	For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	17	Then thy handmaid said, Let, I pray thee, the word of my lord the king be comfortable; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: and Jehovah thy God be with thee.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	18	Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, aught that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	19	And the king said, Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken; for thy servant Joab, he bade	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	20	to change the face of the matter hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	21	And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	22	And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and did obeisance, and blessed the king: and Joab said, To-day thy servant knoweth that I have found favor in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath performed the request of his servant.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	23	So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	24	And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom turned to his own house, and saw not the kings face.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	25	Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	26	And when he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every years end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the kings weight.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	27	And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	28	And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem; and he saw not the kings face.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	29	Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	30	Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joabs field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absaloms servants set the field on fire.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	31	Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	32	And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the kings face; and if there be iniquity	10
ASV	2 Samuel	14	33	So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	1	And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	2	And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that, when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	3	And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	4	Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	5	And it was so, that, when any man came nigh to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	6	And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	7	And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto Jehovah, in Hebron.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	8	For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If Jehovah shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Jehovah.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	9	And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	10	But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom is king in Hebron.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	11	And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they knew not anything.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	12	And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, Davids counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	13	And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	14	And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge o	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	15	And the kings servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall choose.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	16	And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, that were concubines, to keep the house.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	17	And the king went forth, and all the people after him; and they tarried in Beth-merhak.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	18	And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men that came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	19	Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return, and abide with the king: for thou art a foreigner, and also an exile; return to thine own place.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	20	Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us, seeing I go whither I may? return thou, and take back thy brethren; mercy and truth be with thee.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	21	And Ittai answered the king, and said, As Jehovah liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, even there also will thy servant be.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	22	And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	23	And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	24	And, lo, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	25	And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of Jehovah, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	26	but if he say thus, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	27	The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art thou not a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	28	See, I will tarry at the fords of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	29	Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they abode there.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	30	And David went up by the ascent of the mount of Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot: and all the people that were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	31	And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O Jehovah, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	32	And it came to pass, that, when David was come to the top of the ascent, where God was worshipped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	33	And David said unto him, If thou passest on with me, then thou wilt be a burden unto me:	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	34	but if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy fathers servant in time past, so will I now be thy servant; then wilt thou defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	35	And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the kings house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	36	Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadoks son, and Jonathan, Abiathars son; and by them ye shall send unto me everything that ye shall hear.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	15	37	So Hushai, Davids friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	16	1	And when David was a little past the top of the ascent, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a b	10
ASV	2 Samuel	16	2	And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses are for the kings household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	16	3	And the king said, And where is thy masters son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem; for he said, To-day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	16	4	Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine is all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I do obeisance; let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, O king.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	16	5	And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and cursed still as he came.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	16	6	And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	16	7	And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow:	10
ASV	2 Samuel	16	8	Jehovah hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and Jehovah hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and, behold, thou art taken in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of blo	10
ASV	2 Samuel	16	9	Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	16	10	And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Because he curseth, and because Jehovah hath said unto him, Curse David; who then shall say, Wherefore hast thou done so?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	16	11	And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more may this Benjamite now do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for Jehovah hath bidden him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	16	12	It may be that Jehovah will look on the wrong done unto me, and that Jehovah will requite me good for his cursing of me this day.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	16	13	So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	16	14	And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	16	15	And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	16	16	And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, Davids friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, Long live the king, Long live the king.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	16	17	And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	16	18	And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom Jehovah, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	16	19	And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy fathers presence, so will I be in thy presence.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	16	20	Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we shall do.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	16	21	And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy fathers concubines, that he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then will the hands of all that are with thee be strong.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	16	22	So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his fathers concubines in the sight of all Israel.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	16	23	And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	1	Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	2	and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid; and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	3	and I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	4	And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	5	Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	6	And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not, speak thou.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	7	And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given this time is not good.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	8	Hushai said moreover, Thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field; and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	9	Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them are fallen at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	10	And even he that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they that are with him are valiant men.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	11	But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	12	So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground; and of him and of all the men that are with him we will not leave so much as one.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	13	Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	14	And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For Jehovah had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Jehovah might bring evil upon Absalom.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	15	Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	16	Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	17	Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En-rogel; and a maid-servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David: for they might not be seen to come into the city.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	18	But a lad saw them, and told Absalom: and they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down thither.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	19	And the woman took and spread the covering over the wells mouth, and strewed bruised grain thereon; and nothing was known.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	20	And Absaloms servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They are gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	21	And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said unto David, Arise ye, and pass quickly over the water; for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	22	Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over the Jordan.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	23	And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home, unto his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	24	Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	25	And Absalom set Amasa over the host instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, that went in to Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joabs mother.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	26	And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	27	And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	28	brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched grain, and beans, and lentils, and parched pulse,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	17	29	and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	1	And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	2	And David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joabs brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go f	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	3	But the people said, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but thou art worth ten thousand of us; therefore now it is better that thou be ready to succor us out of the ci	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	4	And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	5	And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	6	So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	7	And the people of Israel were smitten there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	8	For the battle was there spread over the face of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	9	And Absalom chanced to meet the servants of David. And Absalom was riding upon his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between heaven and earth; and the mule that was unde	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	10	And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	11	And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest it, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten pieces of silver, and a girdle.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	12	And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the kings son; for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young m	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	13	Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hid from the king), then thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	14	Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	15	And ten young men that bare Joabs armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	16	And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	17	And they took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	18	Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the kings dale; for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name; and it is called Absaloms monument, unto this d	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	19	Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that Jehovah hath avenged him of his enemies.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	20	And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not be the bearer of tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day; but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the kings son is dead.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	21	Then said Joab to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what thou hast seen. And the Cushite bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	22	Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But come what may, let me, I pray thee, also run after the Cushite. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou wilt have no reward for the tidings?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	23	But come what may, said he, I will run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	24	Now David was sitting between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	25	And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	26	And the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold, another man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	27	And the watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	28	And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	29	And the king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the kings servant, even me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	30	And the king said, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	31	And, behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, Tidings for my lord the king; for Jehovah hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	32	And the king said unto the Cushite, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And the Cushite answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise up against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	18	33	And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	1	And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	2	And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people; for the people heard say that day, The king grieveth for his son.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	3	And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people that are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	4	And the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	5	And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, who this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	6	in that thou lovest them that hate thee, and hatest them that love thee. For thou hast declared this day, that princes and servants are nought unto thee: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	7	Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants; for I swear by Jehovah, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry a man with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that hath befallen thee from thy yout	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	8	Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate: and all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his tent.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	9	And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land from Absalom.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	10	And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	11	And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, to bring him to his house.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	12	Ye are my brethren, ye are my bone and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	13	And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	14	And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent unto the king, saying, Return thou, and all thy servants.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	15	So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	16	And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	17	And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	18	And there went over a ferry-boat to bring over the kings household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he was come over the Jordan.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	19	And he said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	20	For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	21	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed Jehovahs anointed?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	22	And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	23	And the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	24	And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	25	And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	26	And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because thy servant is lame.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	27	And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	28	For all my fathers house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more unto the king?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	29	And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I say, Thou and Ziba divide the land.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	30	And Mephibosheth said unto the king, yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come in peace unto his own house.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	31	And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	32	Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	33	And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will sustain thee with me in Jerusalem.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	34	And Barzillai said unto the king, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	35	I am this day fourscore years old: can I discern between good and bad? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the kin	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	36	Thy servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	37	Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold, thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	38	And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	39	And all the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over: and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	40	So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him: and all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	41	And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan, and all Davids men with him?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	42	And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then are ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all at the kings cost? or hath he given us any gift?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	19	43	And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	1	And there happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew the trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	2	So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	3	And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and provided them with sustenance, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their de	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	4	Then said the king to Amasa, Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be thou here present.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	5	So Amasa went to call the men of Judah together; but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	6	And David said to Abishai, Now will Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lords servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities, and escape out of our sight.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	7	And there went out after him Joabs men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	8	When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. And Joab was girded with his apparel of war that he had put on, and thereon was a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fel	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	9	And Joab said to Amasa, Is it well with thee, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	10	But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joabs hand: so he smote him therewith in the body, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	11	And there stood by him one of Joabs young men, and said, He that favoreth Joab, and he that is for David, let him follow Joab.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	12	And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood stil	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	13	When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	14	And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Beth-maacah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	15	And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	16	Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	17	And he came near unto her; and the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thy handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	18	Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	19	I am of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of Jehovah?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	20	And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	21	The matter is not so: but a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David; deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his hea	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	22	Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. And he blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem un	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	23	Now Joab was over all the host of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	24	and Adoram was over the men subject to taskwork; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	25	and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	20	26	and also Ira the Jairite was chief minister unto David.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	21	1	And there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face of Jehovah. And Jehovah said, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites.	10
ASV	1 Kings	7	31	And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: and the mouth thereof was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also upon the mouth of it were gravings, and their panels were foursquare, not round.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	32	And the four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axletrees of the wheels were in the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	33	And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their felloes, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	34	And there were four undersetters at the four corners of each base: the undersetters thereof were of the base itself.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	35	And in the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high; and on the top of the base the stays thereof and the panels thereof were of the same.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	36	And on the plates of the stays thereof, and on the panels thereof, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm-trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths round about.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	37	After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	38	And he made ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths; and every laver was four cubits; and upon very one of the ten bases one laver.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	39	And he set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	40	And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of Jehovah:	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	41	the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	42	and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars;	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	43	and the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases;	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	44	and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	45	and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon, in the house of Jehovah, were of burnished brass.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	46	In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	47	And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: the weight of the brass could not be found out.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	48	And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Jehovah: the golden altar, and the table whereupon the showbread was, of gold;	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	49	and the candlesticks, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	50	and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the firepans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple, of gold.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	51	Thus all the work that king Solomon wrought in the house of Jehovah was finished. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of Jehova	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	1	Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers houses of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zi	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	2	And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	3	And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	4	And they brought up the ark of Jehovah, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these did the priests and the Levites bring up.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	5	And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	6	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	7	For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	8	And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place before the oracle; but they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	9	There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	10	And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Jehovah,	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	11	so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	12	Then spake Solomon, Jehovah hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	13	I have surely built thee a house of habitation, a place for thee to dwell in for ever.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	14	And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	15	And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who spake with his mouth unto David thy father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,	11
ASV	2 Samuel	21	2	And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal for the children of	10
ASV	2 Samuel	21	3	and David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of Jehovah?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	21	4	And the Gibeonites said unto him, It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	21	5	And they said unto the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us, that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	21	6	let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto Jehovah in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Jehovah. And the king said, I will give them.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	21	7	But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of Jehovahs oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	21	8	But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bare to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:	10
ASV	2 Samuel	21	9	And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before Jehovah, and they fell all seven together. And they were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	21	10	And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water was poured upon them from heaven; and she suffered neither the birds of the heavens to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of th	10
ASV	2 Samuel	21	11	And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	21	12	And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines slew Saul in Gilboa;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	21	13	and he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son: and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	21	14	And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	21	15	And the Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines. And David waxed faint;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	21	16	and Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	21	17	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succored him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the lamp of Israel.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	21	18	And it came to pass after this, that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Saph, who was of the sons of the giant.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	21	19	And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim the Beth-lehemite slew Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weavers beam.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	21	20	And there was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	21	21	And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, Davids brother, slew him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	21	22	These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	1	And David spake unto Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	2	and he said, Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer, even mine;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	3	God, my rock, in him will I take refuge; My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge; My saviour, thou savest me from violence.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	4	I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised: So shall I be saved from mine enemies.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	5	For the waves of death compassed me; The floods of ungodliness made me afraid:	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	6	The cords of Sheol were round about me; The snares of death came upon me.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	7	In my distress I called upon Jehovah; Yea, I called unto my God: And he heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry came into his ears.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	8	Then the earth shook and trembled, The foundations of heaven quaked And were shaken, because he was wroth.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	9	There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals were kindled by it.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	10	He bowed the heavens also, and came down; And thick darkness was under his feet.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	11	And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; Yea, he was seen upon the wings of the wind.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	12	And he made darkness pavilions round about him, Gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	13	At the brightness before him Coals of fire were kindled.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	14	Jehovah thundered from heaven, And the Most High uttered his voice.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	15	And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; Lightning, and discomfited them.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	16	Then the channels of the sea appeared, The foundations of the world were laid bare, By the rebuke of Jehovah, At the blast of the breath of his nostrils.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	17	He sent from on high, he took me; He drew me out of many waters;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	18	He delivered me from my strong enemy, From them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	19	They came upon me in the day of my calamity; But Jehovah was my stay.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	20	He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	21	Jehovah rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	22	For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, And have not wickedly departed from my God.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	23	For all his ordinances were before me; And as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	24	I was also perfect toward him; And I kept myself from mine iniquity.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	25	Therefore hath Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness in his eyesight.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	26	With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; With the perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	27	With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; And with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	28	And the afflicted people thou wilt save; But thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	29	For thou art my lamp, O Jehovah; And Jehovah will lighten my darkness.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	30	For by thee I run upon a troop; By my God do I leap over a wall.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	31	As for God, his way is perfect: The word of Jehovah is tried; He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in him.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	32	For who is God, save Jehovah? And who is a rock, save our God?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	33	God is my strong fortress; And he guideth the perfect in his way.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	34	He maketh his feet like hinds feet, And setteth me upon my high places.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	35	He teacheth my hands to war, So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	36	Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation; And thy gentleness hath made me great.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	37	Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; And my feet have not slipped.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	38	I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; Neither did I turn again till they were consumed.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	39	And I have consumed them, and smitten them through, so that they cannot arise: Yea, they are fallen under my feet.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	40	For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	41	Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me, That I might cut off them that hate me.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	42	They looked, but there was none to save; Even unto Jehovah, but he answered them not.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	43	Then did I beat them small as the dust of the earth, I did crush them as the mire of the streets, and did spread them abroad.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	44	Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people; Thou hast kept me to be the head of the nations: A people whom I have not known shall serve me.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	45	The foreigners shall submit themselves unto me: As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	46	The foreigners shall fade away, And shall come trembling out of their close places.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	47	Jehovah liveth; And blessed be my rock; And exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	48	Even the God that executeth vengeance for me, And that bringeth down peoples under me,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	49	And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: Yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me; Thou deliverest me from the violent man.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	50	Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the nations, And will sing praises unto thy name.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	22	51	Great deliverance giveth he to his king, And showeth lovingkindness to his anointed, To David and to his seed, for evermore.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	1	Now these are the last words of David. David the son of Jesse saith, And the man who was raised on high saith, The anointed of the God of Jacob, And the sweet psalmist of Israel:	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	2	The Spirit of Jehovah spake by me, And his word was upon my tongue.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	3	The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spake to me: One that ruleth over men righteously, That ruleth in the fear of God,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	4	He shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, A morning without clouds, When the tender grass springeth out of the earth, Through clear shining after rain.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	5	Verily my house is not so with God; Yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, Ordered in all things, and sure: For it is all my salvation, and all my desire, Although he maketh it not to grow.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	6	But the ungodly shall be all of them as thorns to be thrust away, Because they cannot be taken with the hand;	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	7	But the man that toucheth them Must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear: And they shall be utterly burned with fire in their place.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	8	These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain at one time.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	9	And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	10	He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword; and Jehovah wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to take spoil.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	11	And after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	12	But he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and Jehovah wrought a great victory.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	13	And three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	14	And David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	15	And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate!	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	16	And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto Jehovah.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	17	And he said, Be it far from me, O Jehovah, that I should do this: shall I drink the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	18	And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	19	Was he not most honorable of the three? therefore he was made their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	20	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he slew the two sons of Ariel of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	21	And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptians hand, and slew him with his own spear.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	22	These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	23	He was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	24	Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	25	Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	26	Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	27	Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	28	Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	29	Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	30	Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	31	Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	32	Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	33	Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	34	Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	35	Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	36	Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	37	Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armorbearers to Joab the son of Zeruiah,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	38	Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	23	39	Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	1	And again the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	2	And the king said to Joab the captain of the host, who was with him, Go now to and fro through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the sum of the people.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	3	And Joab said unto the king, Now Jehovah thy God add unto the people, how many soever they may be, a hundredfold; and may the eyes of my lord the king see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	4	Notwithstanding, the kings word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	5	And they passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and unto Jazer:	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	6	then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and round about to Sidon,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	7	and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beer-sheba.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	8	So when they had gone to and from through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	9	And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	10	And Davids heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto Jehovah, I have sinned greatly in that which I have done: but now, O Jehovah, put away, I beseech thee, the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	11	And when David rose up in the morning, the word of Jehovah came unto the prophet Gad, Davids seer, saying,	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	12	Go and speak unto David, Thus saith Jehovah, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	13	So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thy foes while they pursue thee? or shall there be three days pestilence in thy land? now advise thee, and	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	14	And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of Jehovah; for his mercies are great; and let me not fall into the hand of man.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	15	So Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	16	And when the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Jehovah repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough; now stay thy hand. And the angel of Jehovah was by the threshing-floor of Araunah th	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	17	And David spake unto Jehovah when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done perversely; but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my fathers house.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	18	And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	19	And David went up according to the saying of Gad, as Jehovah commanded.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	20	And Araunah looked forth, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	21	And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing-floor of thee, to build an altar unto Jehovah, that the plague may be stayed from the people.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	22	And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, the oxen for the burnt-offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood:	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	23	all this, O king, doth Araunah give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, Jehovah thy God accept thee.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	24	And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will verily buy it of thee at a price. Neither will I offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah my God which cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.	10
ASV	2 Samuel	24	25	And David built there an altar unto Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. So Jehovah was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.	10
ASV	1 Kings	1	1	Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	2	Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	3	So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	4	And the damsel was very fair; and she cherished the king, and ministered to him; but the king knew her not.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	5	Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	6	And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he was also a very goodly man; and he was born after Absalom.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	7	And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	8	But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men that belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	9	And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel; and he called all his brethren, the kings sons, and all the men of Judah, the kings servants:	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	10	but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	11	Then Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	12	Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	13	Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	14	Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	15	And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering unto the king.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	16	And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	17	And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by Jehovah thy God unto thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	18	And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and thou, my lord the king, knowest it not:	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	19	and he hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host; but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	20	And thou, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	21	Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	22	And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	23	And they told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	24	And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	25	For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the kings sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and say, Long live king	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	26	But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	27	Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not showed unto thy servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	28	Then king David answered and said, Call to me Bath-sheba. And she came into the kings presence, and stood before the king.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	29	And the king sware, and said, As Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	30	verily as I sware unto thee by Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; verily so will I do this day.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	31	Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	32	And king David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	33	And the king said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	34	and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel; and blow ye the trumpet, and say, Long live king Solomon.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	35	Then ye shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead; and I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	36	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: Jehovah, the God of my lord the king, say so too.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	37	As Jehovah hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	38	So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king Davids mule, and brought him to Gihon.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	39	And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, Long live king Solomon.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	40	And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	41	And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	42	While he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said, Come in; for thou art a worthy man, and bringest good tidings.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	43	And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king:	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	44	and the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride upon the kings mule;	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	45	and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon; and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	46	And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	47	And moreover the kings servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, Thy God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne: and the king bowed himself upon the bed.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	48	And also thus said the king, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	49	And all the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	50	And Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	51	And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon; for, lo, he hath laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me first that he will not slay his servant with the sword.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	52	And Solomon said, If he shall show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.	11
ASV	1 Kings	1	53	So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and did obeisance to king Solomon; and Solomon said unto him, Go to thy house.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	1	Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	2	I am going the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man;	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	3	and keep the charge of Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his ordinances, and his testimonies, according to that which is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	4	That Jehovah may establish his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	5	Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did unto me, even what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the bl	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	6	Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to Sheol in peace.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	7	But show kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table; for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom thy brother.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	8	And, behold, there is with thee Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I sware to him by Jehovah, saying, I will not put the	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	9	Now therefore hold him not guiltless, for thou art a wise man; and thou wilt know what thou oughtest to do unto him, and thou shalt bring his hoar head down to Sheol with blood.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	10	And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	11	And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	12	And Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	13	Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	14	He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	15	And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brothers; for it was his from Jehovah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	16	And now I ask one petition of thee; deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	17	And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king (for he will not say thee nay), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	18	And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	19	Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the kings mother; and she sat on his right hand.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	20	Then she said, I ask one small petition of thee; deny me not. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny thee.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	21	And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	22	And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	23	Then king Solomon sware by Jehovah, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah hath not spoken this word against his own life.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	24	Now therefore as Jehovah liveth, who hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	25	And king Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him, so that he died.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	26	And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord Jehovah before David my father, and because thou	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	27	So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto Jehovah, that he might fulfil the word of Jehovah, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	28	And the tidings came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the Tent of Jehovah, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	29	And it was told king Solomon, Joab is fled unto the Tent of Jehovah, and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	30	And Benaiah came to the Tent of Jehovah, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	31	And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my fathers house.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	32	And Jehovah will return his blood upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, and my father David knew it not, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	33	So shall their blood return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but unto David, and unto his seed, and unto his house, and unto his throne, shall there be peace for ever from Jehovah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	34	Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	35	And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host; and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	36	And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	37	For on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, know thou for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	38	And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	39	And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants are in Gath.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	40	And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	41	And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	42	And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not adjure thee by Jehovah, and protest unto thee, saying, Know for certain, that on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me,	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	43	Why then hast thou not kept the oath of Jehovah, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	44	The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore Jehovah shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	45	But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before Jehovah for ever.	11
ASV	1 Kings	2	46	So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell upon him, so that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	1	And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaohs daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of Jehovah, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	2	Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of Jehovah until those days.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	3	And Solomon loved Jehovah, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	4	And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	5	In Gibeon Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	6	And Solomon said, Thou hast showed unto thy servant David my father great lovingkindness, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great lovingkindness, that	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	7	And now, O Jehovah my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child; I know not how to go out or come in.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	8	And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	9	Give thy servant therefore an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this thy great people?	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	10	And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	11	And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life, neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies, but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern justice;	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	12	behold, I have done according to thy word: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there hath been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	13	And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee, all thy days.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	14	And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	15	And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream: and he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and offered up burnt-offerings, and offered peace-offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	16	Then there came two women that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	17	And the one woman said, Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	18	And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also; and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	19	And this womans child died in the night, because she lay upon it.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	20	And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thy handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	21	And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, whom I did bear.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	22	And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	23	Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	24	And the king said, Fetch me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	25	And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	26	Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her heart yearned over her son, and she said, Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, It shall be neither mine nor thine; divide it.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	27	Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.	11
ASV	1 Kings	3	28	And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice.	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	1	And king Solomon was king over all Israel.	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	2	And these were the princes whom he had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest;	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	3	Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder;	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	4	and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	5	and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister, and the kings friend;	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	6	and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the men subject to taskwork.	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	7	And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided victuals for the king and his household: each man had to make provision for a month in the year.	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	8	And these are their names: Ben-hur, in the hill-country of Ephraim;	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	9	Ben-deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan;	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	10	Ben-hesed, in Arubboth (to him pertained Socoh, and all the land of Hepher);	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	11	Ben-abinadab, in all the height of Dor (he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife);	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	12	Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam;	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	13	Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead (to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; even to him pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brazen bars);	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	14	Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	15	Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon to wife);	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	16	Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	17	Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar;	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	18	Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin;	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	19	Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer that was in the land.	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	20	Judah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry.	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	21	And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought tribute, and served Solomon all the days of his life.	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	22	And Solomons provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	23	ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides harts, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fatted fowl.	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	24	For he had dominion over all the region on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River: and he had peace on all sides round about him.	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	25	And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	26	And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	27	And those officers provided victuals for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomons table, every man in his month; they let nothing be lacking.	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	28	Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge.	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	29	And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore.	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	30	And Solomons wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt.	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	31	For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all the nations round about.	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	32	And he spake three thousand proverbs; and his songs were a thousand and five.	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	33	And he spake of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall; he spake also of beasts, and of birds, and of creeping things, and of fishes.	11
ASV	1 Kings	4	34	And there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.	11
ASV	1 Kings	5	1	And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.	11
ASV	1 Kings	5	2	And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,	11
ASV	1 Kings	5	3	Thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house for the name of Jehovah his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until Jehovah put them under the soles of his feet.	11
ASV	1 Kings	5	4	But now Jehovah my God hath given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary, nor evil occurrence.	11
ASV	1 Kings	5	5	And, behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God, as Jehovah spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build the house for my name.	11
ASV	1 Kings	5	6	Now therefore command thou that they cut me cedar-trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants; and I will give thee hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt say: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that knowe	11
ASV	1 Kings	5	7	And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be Jehovah this day, who hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.	11
ASV	1 Kings	5	8	And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have heard the message which thou hast sent unto me: I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.	11
ASV	1 Kings	5	9	My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea; and I will make them into rafts to go by sea unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and thou shalt receive them; and thou shalt accomplish my desir	11
ASV	1 Kings	5	10	So Hiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of fir according to all his desire.	11
ASV	1 Kings	5	11	And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.	11
ASV	1 Kings	5	12	And Jehovah gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.	11
ASV	1 Kings	5	13	And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.	11
ASV	1 Kings	5	14	And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home; and Adoniram was over the men subject to taskwork.	11
ASV	1 Kings	5	15	And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains;	11
ASV	1 Kings	5	16	besides Solomons chief officers that were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.	11
ASV	1 Kings	5	17	And the king commanded, and they hewed out great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with wrought stone.	11
ASV	1 Kings	5	18	And Solomons builders and Hirams builders and the Gebalites did fashion them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	1	And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomons reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	2	And the house which king Solomon built for Jehovah, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	3	And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	4	And for the house he made windows of fixed lattice-work.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	5	And against the wall of the house he built stories round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle; and he made side-chambers round about.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	6	The nethermost story was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for on the outside he made offsets in the wall of the house round about, that the beams should not have hold in the walls of the house.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	7	And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	8	The door for the middle side-chambers was in the right side of the house: and they went up by winding stairs into the middle story, and out of the middle into the third.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	9	So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	10	And he built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	11	And the word of Jehovah came to Solomon, saying,	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	12	Concerning this house which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute mine ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I establish my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	13	And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	14	So Solomon built the house, and finished it.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	15	And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar: from the floor of the house unto the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	16	And he built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor unto the walls of the ceiling: he built them for it within, for an oracle, even for the most holy place.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	17	And the house, that is, the temple before the oracle, was forty cubits long.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	18	And there was cedar on the house within, carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	19	And he prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	20	And within the oracle was a space of twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof; and he overlaid it with pure gold: and he covered the altar with cedar.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	21	So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	22	And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house was finished: also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	23	And in the oracle he made two cherubim of olive-wood, each ten cubits high.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	24	And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	25	And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one form.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	26	The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	27	And he set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	28	And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	29	And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, within and without.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	30	And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	31	And for the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive-wood: the lintel and door-posts were a fifth part of the wall.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	32	So he made two doors of olive-wood; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm-trees.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	33	So also made he for the entrance of the temple door-posts of olive-wood, out of a fourth part of the wall;	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	34	and two doors of fir-wood: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	35	And he carved thereon cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted upon the graven work.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	36	And he built the inner court with three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	37	In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of Jehovah laid, in the month Ziv.	11
ASV	1 Kings	6	38	And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	1	And Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	2	For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was a hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	3	And it was covered with cedar above over the forty and five beams, that were upon the pillars; fifteen in a row.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	4	And there were beams in three rows, and window was over against window in three ranks.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	5	And all the doors and posts were made square with beams: and window was over against window in three ranks.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	6	And he made the porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits; and a porch before them; and pillars and a threshold before them.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	7	And he made the porch of the throne where he was to judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	8	And his house where he was to dwell, the other court within the porch, was of the like work. He made also a house for Pharaohs daughter (whom Solomon had taken to wife), like unto this porch.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	9	All these were of costly stones, even of hewn stone, according to measure, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside unto the great court.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	10	And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	11	And above were costly stones, even hewn stone, according to measure, and cedar-wood.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	12	And the great court round about had three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams; like as the inner court of the house of Jehovah, and the porch of the house.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	13	And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	14	He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	15	For he fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits compassed either of them about.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	16	And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	17	There were nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	18	So he made the pillars; and there were two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars: and so did he for the other capital.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	19	And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily-work, four cubits.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	20	And there were capitals above also upon the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about upon the other capital.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	21	And he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	22	And upon the top of the pillars was lily-work: so was the work of the pillars finished.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	23	And he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and the height thereof was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	24	And under the brim of it round about there were knops which did compass it, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about: the knops were in two rows, cast when it was cast.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	25	It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	26	And it was a handbreadth thick: and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it held two thousand baths.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	27	And he made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	28	And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had panels; and there were panels between the ledges;	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	29	and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and upon the ledges there was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.	11
ASV	1 Kings	7	30	And every base had four brazen wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet thereof had undersetters: beneath the laver were the undersetters molten, with wreaths at the side of each.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	16	Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	17	Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	18	But Jehovah said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart:	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	19	nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	20	And Jehovah hath established his word that he spake; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	21	And there have I set a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	22	And Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	23	and he said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keepest covenant and lovingkindness with thy servants, that walk before thee with all their heart;	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	24	who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him: yea, thou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	25	Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	26	Now therefore, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	27	But will God in very deed dwell on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded!	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	28	Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee this day;	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	29	that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place whereof thou hast said, My name shall be there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	30	And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yea, hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place; and when thou hearest, forgive.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	31	If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and he come and swear before thine altar in this house;	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	32	then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head, and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	33	When thy people Israel are smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; if they turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication unto thee in this house:	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	34	then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	35	When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them:	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	36	then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	37	If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be;	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	38	what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, who shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	39	then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	40	that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	41	Moreover concerning the foreigner, that is not of thy people Israel, when he shall come out of a far country for thy names sake;	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	42	(for they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy mighty hand, and of thine outstretched arm); when he shall come and pray toward this house;	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	43	hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calleth to thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	44	If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatsoever way thou shalt send them, and they pray unto Jehovah toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name;	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	45	then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	46	If they sin against thee (for there is no man that sinneth not), and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto the land of the enemy, far off or near;	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	47	yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captive, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have dealt wickedly;	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	48	if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	49	then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling-place, and maintain their cause;	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	50	and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them;	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	51	(for they are thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron);	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	52	that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them whensoever they cry unto thee.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	53	For thou didst separate them from among all the peoples of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord Jehovah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	54	And it was so, that, when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto Jehovah, he arose from before the altar of Jehovah, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	55	And he stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying,	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	56	Blessed be Jehovah, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by Moses his servant.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	57	Jehovah our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us;	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	58	that he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his ordinances, which he commanded our fathers.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	59	And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before Jehovah, be nigh unto Jehovah our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel, as every day shall require;	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	60	that all the peoples of the earth may know that Jehovah, he is God; there is none else.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	61	Let your heart therefore be perfect with Jehovah our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	62	And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before Jehovah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	63	And Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he offered unto Jehovah, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Jehovah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	64	The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar that was before Jehovah was too lit	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	65	So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt, before Jehovah our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.	11
ASV	1 Kings	8	66	On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that Jehovah had showed unto David his servant, and to Israel his people.	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	1	And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of Jehovah, and the kings house, and all Solomons desire which he was pleased to do,	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	2	that Jehovah appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	3	And Jehovah said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	4	And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances;	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	5	then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom over Israel for ever, according as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	6	But if ye shall turn away from following me, ye or your children, and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	7	then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples.	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	8	And though this house is so high, yet shall every one that passeth by it be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath Jehovah done thus unto this land, and to this house?	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	9	and they shall answer, Because they forsook Jehovah their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath Jehovah brought all this evil upon them.	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	10	And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the two houses, the house of Jehovah and the kings house,	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	11	(now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar-trees and fir-trees, and with gold, according to all his desire), that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	12	And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	13	And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	14	And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	15	And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised, to build the house of Jehovah, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	16	Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a portion unto his daughter, Solomons wife.	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	17	And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether,	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	18	and Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land,	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	19	and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	20	As for all the people that were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel;	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	21	their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, of them did Solomon raise a levy of bondservants unto this day.	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	22	But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondservants; but they were the men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	23	These were the chief officers that were over Solomons work, five hundred and fifty, who bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	24	But Pharaohs daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	25	And three times a year did Solomon offer burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon the altar which he built unto Jehovah, burning incense therewith, upon the altar that was before Jehovah. So he finished the house.	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	26	And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	27	And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.	11
ASV	1 Kings	9	28	And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	1	And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of Jehovah, she came to prove him with hard questions.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	2	And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones; and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	3	And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not anything hid from the king which he told her not.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	4	And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	5	and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of Jehovah; there was no more spirit in her.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	6	And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	7	Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me; thy wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	8	Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, that stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	9	Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because Jehovah loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do justice and righteousness.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	10	And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	11	And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug-trees and precious stones.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	12	And the king made of the almug-trees pillars for the house of Jehovah, and for the kings house, harps also and psalteries for the singers: there came no such almug-trees, nor were seen, unto this day.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	13	And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, besides that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	14	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	15	besides that which the traders brought, and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of the mingled people, and of the governors of the country.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	16	And king Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of gold went to one buckler.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	17	And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	18	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	19	There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	20	And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	21	And all king Solomons drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	22	For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram: once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	23	So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	24	And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	25	And they brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	26	And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	27	And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	28	And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; and the kings merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.	11
ASV	1 Kings	10	29	And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	1	Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites;	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	2	of the nations concerning which Jehovah said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	3	And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	4	For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God, as was the heart of David his father.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	5	For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	6	And Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and went not fully after Jehovah, as did David his father.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	7	Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, in the mount that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	8	And so did he for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	9	And Jehovah was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from Jehovah, the God of Israel, who had appeared unto him twice,	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	10	and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which Jehovah commanded.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	11	Wherefore Jehovah said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	12	Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it, for David thy fathers sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	13	Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to thy son, for David my servants sake, and for Jerusalems sake which I have chosen.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	14	And Jehovah raised up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the kings seed in Edom.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	15	For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, and had smitten every male in Edom;	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	16	(for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom);	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	17	that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his fathers servants with him, to go into Egypt, Hadad being yet a little child.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	18	And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	19	And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	20	And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaohs house; and Genubath was in Pharaohs house among the sons of Pharaoh.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	21	And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	22	Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit only let me depart.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	23	And God raised up another adversary unto him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	24	And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a troop, when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	25	And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	26	And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mothers name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	27	And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	28	And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labor of the house of Joseph.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	29	And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	30	And Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	31	And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces; for thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee;	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	32	(but he shall have one tribe, for my servant Davids sake and for Jerusalems sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel);	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	33	because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon; and they have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	34	Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servants sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	35	but I will take the kingdom out of his sons hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	36	And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a lamp alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	37	And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	38	And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that which is right in mine eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and will build thee a sure h	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	39	And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	40	Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	41	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	42	And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.	11
ASV	1 Kings	11	43	And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	1	And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	2	And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was yet in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt,	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	3	and they sent and called him), that Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	4	Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	5	And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	6	And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	7	And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	8	But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him.	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	9	And he said unto them, What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter?	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	10	And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou say unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou speak unto them, My little finger is	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	11	And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	13	And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him,	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	14	and spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	15	So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was a thing brought about of Jehovah, that he might establish his word, which Jehovah spake by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	16	And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel depa	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	17	But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	18	Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the men subject to taskwork; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	19	So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	20	And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	21	And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, that were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	22	But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	23	Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying,	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	24	Thus saith Jehovah, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is of me. So they hearkened unto the word of Jehovah, and returned and went their way, according to the word of J	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	25	Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and he went out from thence, and built Penuel.	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	26	And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now will the kingdom return to the house of David:	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	27	if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, then will the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah; and they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	28	Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold; and he said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	29	And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan.	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	30	And this thing became a sin; for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan.	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	31	And he made houses of high places, and made priests from among all the people, that were not of the sons of Levi.	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	32	And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he went up unto the altar; so did he in Beth-el, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Beth-el the pri	11
ASV	1 Kings	12	33	And he went up unto the altar which he had made in Beth-el on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart: and he ordained a feast for the children of Israel, and went up unto the altar, to burn incense.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	1	And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of Jehovah unto Beth-el: and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	2	And he cried against the altar by the word of Jehovah, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith Jehovah: Behold, a son shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he sacrifice the priests of the high places that burn incense upo	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	3	And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which Jehovah hath spoken: Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	4	And it came to pass, when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Beth-el, that Jeroboam put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that h	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	5	The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of Jehovah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	6	And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Entreat now the favor of Jehovah thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God entreated Jehovah, and the kings hand was restored him again, and became as it was bef	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	7	And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	8	And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thy house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place;	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	9	for so was it charged me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Thou shalt eat no bread, nor drink water, neither return by the way that thou camest.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	10	So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Beth-el.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	11	Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Beth-el: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them also they told unto their father.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	12	And their father said unto them, What way went he? Now his sons had seen what way the man of God went, that came from Judah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	13	And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass; and he rode thereon.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	14	And he went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak; and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	15	Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	16	And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	17	for it was said to me by the word of Jehovah, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	18	And he said unto him, I also am a prophet as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	19	So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	20	And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of Jehovah came unto the prophet that brought him back;	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	21	and he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, Forasmuch as thou hast been disobedient unto the mouth of Jehovah, and hast not kept the commandment which Jehovah thy God commanded thee,	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	22	but camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy body shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	23	And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	24	And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his body was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it; the lion also stood by the body.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	25	And, behold, men passed by, and saw the body cast in the way, and the lion standing by the body; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	26	And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the mouth of Jehovah: therefore Jehovah hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the w	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	27	And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled it.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	28	And he went and found his body cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the body: the lion had not eaten the body, nor torn the ass.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	29	And the prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back; and he came to the city of the old prophet, to mourn, and to bury him.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	30	And he laid his body in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	31	And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	32	For the saying which he cried by the word of Jehovah against the altar in Beth-el, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	33	After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again from among all the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high places.	11
ASV	1 Kings	13	34	And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	1	At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	2	And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, who spake concerning me that I should be king over this people.	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	3	And take with thee ten loaves, and cakes, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he will tell thee what shall become of the child.	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	4	And Jeroboams wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	5	And Jehovah said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to inquire of thee concerning her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her; for it will be, when she cometh in, that she will feign herself to be another woman.	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	6	And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	7	Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	8	and rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee; and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes,	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	9	but hast done evil above all that were before thee, and hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	10	therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every man-child, him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man sweepeth away dung, t	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	11	Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat: for Jehovah hath spoken it.	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	12	Arise thou therefore, get thee to thy house: and when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	13	And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him; for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	14	Moreover Jehovah will raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	15	For Jehovah will smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and he will root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their Asherim, provoking Jehovah to anger.	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	16	And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he hath sinned, and wherewith he hath made Israel to sin.	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	17	And Jeroboams wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and as she came to the threshold of the house, the child died.	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	18	And all Israel buried him, and mourned for him, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the prophet.	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	19	And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	20	And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	21	And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his m	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	22	And Judah did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, above all that their fathers had done.	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	23	For they also built them high places, and pillars, and Asherim, on every high hill, and under every green tree;	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	24	and there were also sodomites in the land: they did according to all the abominations of the nations which Jehovah drove out before the children of Israel.	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	25	And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem;	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	26	and he took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the kings house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	27	And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the kings house.	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	28	And it was so, that, as oft as the king went into the house of Jehovah, the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber.	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	29	Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	30	And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.	11
ASV	1 Kings	14	31	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and his mothers name was Naamah the Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	1	Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat began Abijam to reign over Judah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	2	Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	3	And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God, as the heart of David his father.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	4	Nevertheless for Davids sake did Jehovah his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem;	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	5	because David did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and turned not aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	6	Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	7	And the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	8	And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	9	And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Asa to reign over Judah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	10	And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	11	And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, as did David his father.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	12	And he put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	13	And also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	14	But the high places were not taken away: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with Jehovah all his days.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	15	And he brought into the house of Jehovah the things that his father had dedicated, and the things that himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	16	And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	17	And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	18	Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the kings house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants; and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimmon, the son o	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	19	There is a league between me and thee, between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	20	And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	21	And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	22	Then king Asa made a proclamation unto all Judah; none was exempted: and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built therewith Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	23	Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	24	And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	25	And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah; and he reigned over Israel two years.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	26	And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	27	And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	28	Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	29	And it came to pass that, as soon as he was king, he smote all the house of Jeroboam: he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him; according unto the saying of Jehovah, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite;	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	30	for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and wherewith he made Israel to sin, because of his provocation wherewith he provoked Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	31	Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	32	And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	33	In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, and reigned twenty and four years.	11
ASV	1 Kings	15	34	And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	1	And the word of Jehovah came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	2	Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel, and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	3	behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house; and I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	4	Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	5	Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	6	And Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah; and Elah his son reigned in his stead.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	7	And moreover by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of Jehovah against Baasha, and against his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the hous	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	8	In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, and reigned two years.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	9	And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him. Now he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah:	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	10	and Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	11	And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he smote all the house of Baasha: he left him not a single man-child, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	12	Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	13	for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and wherewith they made Israel to sin, to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	14	Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	15	In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	16	And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also smitten the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	17	And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	18	And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the castle of the kings house, and burnt the kings house over him with fire, and died,	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	19	for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	20	Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	21	Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	22	But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	23	In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, and reigned twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	24	And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill, Samaria.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	25	And Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and dealt wickedly above all that were before him.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	26	For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	27	Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	28	So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	29	And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	30	And Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah above all that were before him.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	31	And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	32	And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	33	And Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did yet more to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.	11
ASV	1 Kings	16	34	In his days did Hiel the Beth-elite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof with the loss of Abiram his first-born, and set up the gates thereof with the loss of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by Joshua the	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	1	And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the sojourners of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As Jehovah, the God of Israel, liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	2	And the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying,	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	3	Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	4	And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	5	So he went and did according unto the word of Jehovah; for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	6	And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	7	And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	8	And the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying,	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	9	Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Sidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain thee.	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	10	So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	11	And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	12	And she said, As Jehovah thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but a handful of meal in the jar, and a little oil in the cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	13	And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said; but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it forth unto me, and afterward make for thee and for thy son.	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	14	For thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, The jar of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that Jehovah sendeth rain upon the earth.	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	15	And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	16	The jar of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by Elijah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	17	And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	18	And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? thou art come unto me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son!	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	19	And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the chamber, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	20	And he cried unto Jehovah, and said, O Jehovah my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	21	And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto Jehovah, and said, O Jehovah my God, I pray thee, let this childs soul come into him again.	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	22	And Jehovah hearkened unto the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	23	And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother; and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.	11
ASV	1 Kings	17	24	And the woman said to Elijah, Now I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of Jehovah in thy mouth is truth.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	1	And it came to pass after many days, that the word of Jehovah came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, Go, show thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	2	And Elijah went to show himself unto Ahab. And the famine was sore in Samaria.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	3	And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared Jehovah greatly:	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	4	for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Jehovah, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	5	And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go through the land, unto all the fountains of water, and unto all the brooks: peradventure we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	6	So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	7	And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Is it thou, my lord Elijah?	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	8	And he answered him, It is I: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	9	And he said, Wherein have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	10	As Jehovah thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not here, he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	11	And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	12	And it will come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of Jehovah will carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he will slay me: but I thy servant fear Jehovah from my youth.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	13	Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of Jehovah, how I hid a hundred men of Jehovahs prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	14	And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here; and he will slay me.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	15	And Elijah said, As Jehovah of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself unto him to-day.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	16	So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	17	And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Is it thou, thou troubler of Israel?	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	18	And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy fathers house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of Jehovah, and thou hast followed the Baalim.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	19	Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the Asherah four hundred, that eat at Jezebels table.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	20	So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	21	And Elijah came near unto all the people, and said, How long go ye limping between the two sides? if Jehovah be God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	22	Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, am left a prophet of Jehovah; but Baals prophets are four hundred and fifty men.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	23	Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	24	And call ye on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of Jehovah; and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	25	And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	26	And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped about the altar which was made.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	27	And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud; for he is a god: either he is musing, or he is gone aside, or he is on a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awaked.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	28	And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lances, till the blood gushed out upon them.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	29	And it was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening oblation; but there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	30	And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me; and all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of Jehovah that was thrown down.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	31	And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of Jehovah came, saying, Israel shall be thy name.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	32	And with the stones he built an altar in the name of Jehovah; and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	33	And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid it on the wood. And he said, Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt-offering, and on the wood.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	34	And he said, Do it the second time; and they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time; and they did it the third time.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	35	And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	36	And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening oblation, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant,	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	37	Hear me, O Jehovah, hear me, that this people may know that thou, Jehovah, art God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	38	Then the fire of Jehovah fell, and consumed the burnt-offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	39	And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, Jehovah, he is God; Jehovah, he is God.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	40	and Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	41	And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	42	So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	43	And he said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	44	And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a cloud out of the sea, as small as a mans hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Make ready thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	45	And it came to pass in a little while, that the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel:	11
ASV	1 Kings	18	46	and the hand of Jehovah was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.	11
ASV	1 Kings	19	1	And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.	11
ASV	1 Kings	19	2	Then Jezebel send a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to-morrow about this time.	11
ASV	1 Kings	19	3	And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.	11
ASV	1 Kings	19	4	But he himself went a days journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper-tree: and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is enough; now, O Jehovah, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.	11
ASV	1 Kings	19	5	And he lay down and slept under a juniper-tree; and, behold, an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.	11
ASV	1 Kings	19	6	And he looked, and, behold, there was at his head a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.	11
ASV	1 Kings	19	7	And the angel of Jehovah came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for thee.	11
ASV	1 Kings	19	8	And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.	11
ASV	1 Kings	19	9	And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of Jehovah came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?	11
ASV	1 Kings	19	10	And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword: and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it awa	11
ASV	1 Kings	19	11	And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before Jehovah. And, behold, Jehovah passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before Jehovah; but Jehovah was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake	11
ASV	1 Kings	19	12	and after the earthquake a fire; but Jehovah was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.	11
ASV	1 Kings	19	13	And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?	11
ASV	1 Kings	19	14	And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it awa	11
ASV	1 Kings	19	15	And Jehovah said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, thou shalt anoint Hazael to be king over Syria;	11
ASV	1 Kings	19	16	and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.	11
ASV	1 Kings	19	17	And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay; and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.	11
ASV	1 Kings	19	18	Yet will I leave me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.	11
ASV	1 Kings	19	19	So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed over unto him, and cast his mantle upon him.	11
ASV	1 Kings	19	20	And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again; for what have I done to thee?	11
ASV	1 Kings	19	21	And he returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	1	And Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together; and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	2	And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Ben-hadad,	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	3	Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	4	And the king of Israel answered and said, It is according to thy saying, my lord, O king; I am thine, and all that I have.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	5	And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying, I sent indeed unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	6	but I will send my servants unto thee to-morrow about this time, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	7	Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	8	And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken thou not, neither consent.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	9	Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do; but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	10	And Ben-hadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	11	And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girdeth on his armor boast himself as he that putteth it off.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	12	And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings, in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array against the city.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	13	And, behold, a prophet came near unto Ahab king of Israel, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thy hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	14	And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith Jehovah, By the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall begin the battle? And he answered, Thou.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	15	Then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two: and after them he mustered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	16	And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	17	And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out from Samaria.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	18	And he said, Whether they are come out for peace, take them alive, or whether they are come out for war, taken them alive.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	19	So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed them.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	20	And they slew every one his man; and the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	21	And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	22	And the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	23	And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their god is a god of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we: but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	24	And do this thing: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their room;	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	25	and number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	26	And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad mustered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	27	And the children of Israel were mustered, and were victualled, and went against them: and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	28	And a man of God came near and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, Because the Syrians have said, Jehovah is a god of the hills, but he is not a god of the valleys; therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thy hand,	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	29	And they encamped one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	30	But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand men that were left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	31	And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, we pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	32	So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-hadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	33	Now the men observed diligently, and hasted to catch whether it were his mind; and they said, Thy brother Ben-hadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	34	And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities which my father took from thy father I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. And I, said Ahab, will let thee go with this covenant. So he made a covenant with	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	35	And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his fellow by the word of Jehovah, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	36	Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of Jehovah, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	37	Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, smiting and wounding him.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	38	So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	39	And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king; and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be f	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	40	And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	41	And he hasted, and took the headband away from his eyes; and the king of israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	42	And he said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.	11
ASV	1 Kings	20	43	And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	1	And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	2	And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house; and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it: or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in m	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	3	And Naboth said to Ahab, Jehovah forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	4	And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and woul	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	5	But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	6	And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	7	And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thy heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	8	So she wrote letters in Ahabs name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, and that dwelt with Naboth.	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	9	And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	10	and set two men, base fellows, before him, and let them bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst curse God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him to death.	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	11	And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, according as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	12	They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	13	And the two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him: and the base fellows bare witness against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did curse God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and s	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	14	Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	15	And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	16	And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	17	And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	18	Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwelleth in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to take possession of it.	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	19	And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, Hast thou killed and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	20	And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee, because thou hast sold thyself to do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	21	Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will utterly sweep thee away and will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel:	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	22	and I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and hast made Israel to sin.	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	23	And of Jezebel also spake Jehovah, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel.	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	24	Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat.	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	25	(But there was none like unto Ahab, who did sell himself to do that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	26	And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.)	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	27	And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	28	And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,	11
ASV	1 Kings	21	29	Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his sons days will I bring the evil upon his house.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	1	And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	2	And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	3	And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth-gilead is ours, and we are still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	4	And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	5	And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray thee, for the word of Jehovah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	6	Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	7	But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we may inquire of him?	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	8	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, there is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah, Micaiah the son of Imlah: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	9	Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	10	Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	11	And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until they be consumed.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	12	And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	13	And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak thou good.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	14	And Micaiah said, As Jehovah liveth, what Jehovah saith unto me, that will I speak.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	15	And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go up and prosper; and Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	16	And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	17	And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Jehovah said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	18	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	19	And Micaiah said, Therefore hear thou the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	20	And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner; and another said on that manner.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	21	And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	22	And Jehovah said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also: go forth, and do so.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	23	Now therefore, behold, Jehovah hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets; and Jehovah hath spoken evil concerning thee.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	24	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Jehovah from me to speak unto thee?	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	25	And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	26	And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the kings son;	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	27	and say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	28	And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, Jehovah hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	29	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	30	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	31	Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty and two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	32	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel; and they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	33	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	34	And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	35	And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even; and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	36	And there went a cry throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his country.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	37	So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	38	And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood (now the harlots washed themselves there); according unto the word of Jehovah which he spake.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	39	Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	40	So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	41	And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	42	Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mothers name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	43	And he walked in all the way of Asa his father; He turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah: howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	44	And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	45	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	46	And the remnant of the sodomites, that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	47	And there was no king in Edom: a deputy was king.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	48	Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	49	Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	50	And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	51	Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	52	And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherein he made Israel to sin.	11
ASV	1 Kings	22	53	And he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger Jehovah, the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.	11
ASV	2 Kings	1	1	And Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.	12
ASV	2 Kings	1	2	And Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover of this sickness.	12
ASV	2 Kings	1	3	But the angel of Jehovah said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?	12
ASV	2 Kings	1	4	Now therefore thus saith Jehovah, Thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.	12
ASV	2 Kings	1	5	And the messengers returned unto him, and he said unto them, Why is it that ye are returned?	12
ASV	2 Kings	1	6	And they said unto him, There came up a man to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekr	12
ASV	2 Kings	1	7	And he said unto them, What manner of man was he that came up to meet you, and told you these words?	12
ASV	2 Kings	1	8	And they answered him, He was a hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.	12
ASV	2 Kings	1	9	Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. And he spake unto him, O man of God, the king hath said, Come down.	12
ASV	2 Kings	1	10	And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.	12
ASV	2 Kings	1	11	And again he sent unto him another captain of fifty and his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.	12
ASV	2 Kings	1	12	And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.	12
ASV	2 Kings	1	13	And again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty t	12
ASV	2 Kings	1	14	Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in thy sight.	12
ASV	2 Kings	1	15	And the angel of Jehovah said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.	12
ASV	2 Kings	1	16	And he said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art g	12
ASV	2 Kings	1	17	So he died according to the word of Jehovah which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram began to reign in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.	12
ASV	2 Kings	1	18	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	1	And it came to pass, when Jehovah would take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	2	And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for Jehovah hath sent me as far as Beth-el. And Elisha said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Beth-el.	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	3	And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that Jehovah will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	4	And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for Jehovah hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	5	And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that Jehovah will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	6	And Elijah said unto him, Tarry here, I pray thee; for Jehovah hath sent me to the Jordan. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	7	And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood over against them afar off: and they two stood by the Jordan.	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	8	And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	9	And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	10	And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	11	And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, which parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	12	And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof! And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	13	He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan.	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	14	And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they were divided hither and thither; and Elisha went over.	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	15	And when the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho over against him saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	16	And they said unto him, Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master, lest the Spirit of Jehovah hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	17	And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	18	And they came back to him, while he tarried at Jericho; and he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	19	And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, we pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is bad, and the land miscarrieth.	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	20	And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	21	And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or miscarrying.	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	22	So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spake.	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	23	And he went up from thence unto Beth-el; and as he was going up by the way, there came forth young lads out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou baldhead; go up, thou baldhead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	24	And he looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of Jehovah. And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two lads of them.	12
ASV	2 Kings	2	25	And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	1	Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, but not like his father, and like his mother; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	3	Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	4	Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master; and he rendered unto the king of Israel the wool of a hundred thousand lambs, and of a hundred thousand rams.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	5	But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	6	And king Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	7	And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	8	And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way of the wilderness of Edom.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	9	So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days journey: and there was no water for the host, nor for the beasts that followed them.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	10	And the king of Israel said, Alas! for Jehovah hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	11	But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah, that we may inquire of Jehovah by him? And one of the king of Israels servants answered and said, Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	12	And Jehoshaphat said, The word of Jehovah is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	13	And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay; for Jehovah hath called these three kings together to deliver them	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	14	And Elisha said, As Jehovah of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	15	But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of Jehovah came upon him.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	16	And he said, Thus saith Jehovah, Make this valley full of trenches.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	17	For thus saith Jehovah, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, and ye shall drink, both ye and your cattle and your beasts.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	18	And this is but a light thing in the sight of Jehovah: he will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	19	And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all fountains of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	20	And it came to pass in the morning, about the time of offering the oblation, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	21	Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all that were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood on the border.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	22	And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood:	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	23	and they said, This is blood; the kings are surely destroyed, and they have smitten each man his fellow: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	24	And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	25	And they beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the fountains of water, and felled all the good trees, until in Kir-hareseth only they left the stones thereof; howbeit the s	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	26	And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword, to break through unto the king of Edom; but they could not.	12
ASV	2 Kings	3	27	Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt-offering upon the wall. And there was great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	1	Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear Jehovah: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two children to be bondmen.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	2	And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me; what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid hath not anything in the house, save a pot of oil.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	3	Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	4	And thou shalt go in, and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and thou shalt set aside that which is full.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	5	So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons; they brought the vessels to her, and she poured out.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	6	And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	7	Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy sons of the rest.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	8	And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	9	And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passeth by us continually.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	10	Let us make, I pray thee, a little chamber on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a seat, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	11	And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber and lay there.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	12	And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	13	And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	14	And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no son, and her husband is old.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	15	And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	16	And he said, At this season, when the time cometh round, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thy handmaid.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	17	And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said unto her.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	18	And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	19	And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to his servant, Carry him to his mother.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	20	And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	21	And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	22	And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the servants, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	23	And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to-day? it is neither new moon nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	24	Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slacken me not the riding, except I bid thee.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	25	So she went, and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is the Shunammite:	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	26	run, I pray thee, now to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	27	And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone: for her soul is vexed within her; and Jehovah hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	28	Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	29	Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	30	And the mother of the child said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	31	And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	32	And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	33	He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto Jehovah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	34	And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon him; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	35	Then he returned, and walked in the house once to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	36	And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	37	Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	38	And Elisha came again to Gilgal. And there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	39	And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage; for they knew them not.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	40	So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	41	But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	42	And there came a man from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	43	And his servant said, What, should I set this before a hundred men? But he said, Give the people, that they may eat; for thus saith Jehovah, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.	12
ASV	2 Kings	4	44	So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of Jehovah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	1	Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him Jehovah had given victory unto Syria: he was also a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	2	And the Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naamans wife.	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	3	And she said unto her mistress, Would that my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! then would he recover him of his leprosy.	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	4	And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maiden that is of the land of Israel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	5	And the king of Syria said, Go now, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	6	And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, And now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	7	And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? but consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	8	And it was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	9	So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	10	And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	11	But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Jehovah his God, and wave his hand over the place, and recover the leper.	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	12	Are not Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	13	And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	14	Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	15	And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, Behold now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a present of thy servant.	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	16	But he said, As Jehovah liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	17	And Naaman said, If not, yet, I pray thee, let there be given to thy servant two mules burden of earth; for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt-offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto Jehovah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	18	In this thing Jehovah pardon thy servant: when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, Jehovah pardon thy servant in this thin	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	19	And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	20	But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: as Jehovah liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	21	So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw one running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	22	And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there are come to me from the hill-country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment.	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	23	And Naaman said, Be pleased to take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of raiment, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	24	And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house; and he let the men go, and they departed.	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	25	But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither.	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	26	And he said unto him, Went not my heart with thee, when the man turned from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards and vineyards, and sheep and oxen, and men-servants and maid-servants?	12
ASV	2 Kings	5	27	The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	1	And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell before thee is too strait for us.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	2	Let us go, we pray thee, unto the Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	3	And one said, Be pleased, I pray thee, to go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	4	So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	5	But as one was felling a beam, the axe-head fell into the water; and he cried, and said, Alas, my master! for it was borrowed.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	6	And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither, and made the iron to swim.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	7	And he said, Take it up to thee. So he put out his hand, and took it.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	8	Now the king of Syria was warring against Israel; and he took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	9	And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are coming down.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	10	And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of; and he saved himself there, not once nor twice.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	11	And the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	12	And one of his servants said, Nay, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	13	And he said, Go and see where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	14	Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	15	And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, a host with horses and chariots was round about the city. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	16	And he answered, Fear not; for they that are with us are more than they that are with them.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	17	And Elisha prayed, and said, Jehovah, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And Jehovah opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	18	And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto Jehovah, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	19	And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. And he led them to Samaria.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	20	And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, Jehovah, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And Jehovah opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	21	And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	22	And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	23	And he prepared great provision for them; and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	24	And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	25	And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an asss head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of doves dung for five pieces of silver.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	26	And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	27	And he said, If Jehovah do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the threshing-floor, or out of the winepress?	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	28	And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to-day, and we will eat my son to-morrow.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	29	So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him; and she hath hid her son.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	30	And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes (now he was passing by upon the wall); and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	31	Then he said, God do so to me, and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	32	But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away my head? look, when the	12
ASV	2 Kings	6	33	And while he was yet talking with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of Jehovah; why should I wait for Jehovah any longer?	12
ASV	2 Kings	7	1	And Elisha said, Hear ye the word of Jehovah: thus saith Jehovah, To-morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.	12
ASV	2 Kings	7	2	Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if Jehovah should make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.	12
ASV	2 Kings	7	3	Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?	12
ASV	2 Kings	7	4	If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill	12
ASV	2 Kings	7	5	And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians; and when they were come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no man there.	12
ASV	2 Kings	7	6	For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Eg	12
ASV	2 Kings	7	7	Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.	12
ASV	2 Kings	7	8	And when these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also	12
ASV	2 Kings	7	9	Then they said one to another, We do not well; this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, punishment will overtake us; now therefore come, let us go and tell the kings household.	12
ASV	2 Kings	7	10	So they came and called unto the porter of the city; and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but the horses tied, and the asses tied, and the tents as they were.	12
ASV	2 Kings	7	11	And he called the porters; and they told it to the kings household within.	12
ASV	2 Kings	7	12	And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the cit	12
ASV	2 Kings	7	13	And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it; behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that ar	12
ASV	2 Kings	7	14	They took therefore two chariots with horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.	12
ASV	2 Kings	7	15	And they went after them unto the Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.	12
ASV	2 Kings	7	16	And the people went out, and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of Jehovah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	7	17	And the king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.	12
ASV	2 Kings	7	18	And it came to pass, as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to-morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria;	12
ASV	2 Kings	7	19	and that captain answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if Jehovah should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? and he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof:	12
ASV	2 Kings	7	20	it came to pass even so unto him; for the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	1	Now Elisha had spoken unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thy household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for Jehovah hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	2	And the woman arose, and did according to the word of the man of God; and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	3	And it came to pass at the seven years end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	4	Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	5	And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored to life him that was dead, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woma	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	6	And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	7	And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	8	And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thy hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of Jehovah by him, saying, Shall I recover of this sickness?	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	9	So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this sickness?	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	14	And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	15	And Hezekiah prayed before Jehovah, and said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, that sittest above the cherubim, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	16	Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, wherewith he hath sent him to defy the living God.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	17	Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands,	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	18	and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of mens hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	19	Now therefore, O Jehovah our God, save thou us, I beseech thee, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou Jehovah art God alone.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	20	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard thee.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	21	This is the word that Jehovah hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	22	Whom hast thou defied and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	23	By thy messengers thou hast defied the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir-trees thereof; an	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	24	I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	25	Hast thou not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that it should be thine to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	26	Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as grain blasted before it is grown up.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	27	But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	28	Because of thy raging against me, and because thine arrogancy is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	29	And this shall be the sign unto thee: Ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	30	And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	31	For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape: the zeal of Jehovah shall perform this.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	32	Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	33	By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith Jehovah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	34	For I will defend this city to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant Davids sake.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	35	And it came to pass that night, that the angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	36	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	37	And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	20	1	In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Set thy house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.	12
ASV	2 Kings	20	2	Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto Jehovah, saying,	12
ASV	2 Kings	20	3	Remember now, O Jehovah, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.	12
ASV	2 Kings	20	4	And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle part of the city, that the word of Jehovah came to him, saying,	12
ASV	2 Kings	20	5	Turn back, and say to Hezekiah the prince of my people, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee; on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of Jehovah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	20	6	And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant Davids sake.	12
ASV	2 Kings	20	7	And Isaiah said, Take a cake of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.	12
ASV	2 Kings	20	8	And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that Jehovah will heal me, and that I shall go up unto the house of Jehovah the third day?	12
ASV	2 Kings	20	9	And Isaiah said, This shall be the sign unto thee from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?	12
ASV	2 Kings	20	10	And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to decline ten steps: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten steps.	12
ASV	2 Kings	20	11	And Isaiah the prophet cried unto Jehovah; and he brought the shadow ten steps backward, by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz.	12
ASV	2 Kings	20	12	At that time Berodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.	12
ASV	2 Kings	20	13	And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, no	12
ASV	2 Kings	20	14	Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.	12
ASV	2 Kings	20	15	And he said, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.	12
ASV	2 Kings	20	16	And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	20	17	Behold, the days come, that all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith Jehovah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	20	18	And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.	12
ASV	2 Kings	20	19	Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of Jehovah which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, Is it not so, if peace and truth shall be in my days?	12
ASV	2 Kings	20	20	Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?	12
ASV	2 Kings	20	21	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers; and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned five and fifty years in Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Hephzibah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, after the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	3	For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made an Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	4	And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, whereof Jehovah said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	5	And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of Jehovah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	6	And he made his son to pass through the fire, and practised augury, and used enchantments, and dealt with them that had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	7	And he set the graven image of Asherah, that he had made, in the house of which Jehovah said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever;	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	8	neither will I cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	9	But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do that which is evil more than did the nations whom Jehovah destroyed before the children of Israel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	10	And Jehovah spake by his servants the prophets, saying,	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	10	And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou shalt surely recover; howbeit Jehovah hath showed me that he shall surely die.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	11	And he settled his countenance stedfastly upon him, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	12	And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strongholds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash in pieces their little	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	13	And Hazael said, But what is thy servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, Jehovah hath showed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	14	Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou wouldest surely recover.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	15	And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took the coverlet, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	16	And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	17	Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	18	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife; and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	19	Howbeit Jehovah would not destroy Judah, for David his servants sake, as he promised him to give unto him a lamp for his children alway.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	20	In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	21	Then Joram passed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites that compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	22	So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then did Libnah revolt at the same time.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	23	And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	24	And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	25	In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	26	Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mothers name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	27	And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did the house of Ahab; for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	28	And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram.	12
ASV	2 Kings	8	29	And king Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	1	And Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this vial of oil in thy hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	2	And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	3	Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith Jehovah, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	4	So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	5	And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of us all? And he said, To thee, O captain.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	6	And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of Jehovah, even over Israel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	7	And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Jehovah, at the hand of Jezebel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	8	For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	9	And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	10	And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	11	Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man and what his talk was.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	12	And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, I have anointed thee king over Israel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	13	Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew the trumpet, saying, Jehu is king.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	14	So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was keeping Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria;	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	15	but king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If this be your mind, then let none escape and go forth out of the city, to go to tell it in Jezre	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	16	So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	17	Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	18	So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not back.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	19	Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	20	And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not back: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	21	And Joram said, Make ready. And they made ready his chariot. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	22	And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	23	And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	24	And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and smote Joram between his arms; and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	25	Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, Jehovah laid this burden upon him:	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	26	Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith Jehovah; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith Jehovah. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of Jehovah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	27	But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden-house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot: and they smote him at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	28	And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	29	And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	30	And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and attired her head, and looked out at the window.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	31	And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Is it peace, thou Zimri, thy masters murderer?	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	32	And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	33	And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trod her under foot.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	34	And when he was come in, he did eat and drink; and he said, See now to this cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a kings daughter.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	35	And they went to bury her; but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	36	Wherefore they came back, and told him. And he said, This is the word of Jehovah, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall the dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel;	12
ASV	2 Kings	9	37	and the body of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel, so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	1	Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, even the elders, and unto them that brought up the sons of Ahab, saying,	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	2	And now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your masters sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and armor;	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	3	look ye out the best and meetest of your masters sons, and set him on his fathers throne, and fight for your masters house.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	4	But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, the two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	5	And he that was over the household, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and they that brought up the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any man king: do thou that which	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	6	Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be on my side, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your masters sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to-morrow this time. Now the kings sons, being seventy persons,	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	7	And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the kings sons, and slew them, even seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them unto him to Jezreel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	8	And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the kings sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	9	And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye are righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him; but who smote all these?	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	10	Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of Jehovah, which Jehovah spake concerning the house of Ahab: for Jehovah hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	11	So Jehu smote all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his familiar friends, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	12	And he arose and departed, and went to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing-house of the shepherds in the way,	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	13	Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah: and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	14	And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing-house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	15	And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thy heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thy hand. And he gave h	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	16	And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for Jehovah. So they made him ride in his chariot.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	17	And when he came to Samaria, he smote all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake to Elijah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	18	And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	19	Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshippers, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtlety, to the intent that	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	20	And Jehu said, Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	21	And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	22	And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	23	And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal; and he said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of Jehovah, but the worshippers of Baal only.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	24	And they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt-offerings. Now Jehu had appointed him fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	25	And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains c	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	26	And they brought forth the pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burned them.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	27	And they brake down the pillar of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught-house, unto this day.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	28	Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	29	Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Beth-el, and that were in Dan.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	30	And Jehovah said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, thy sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	31	But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Jehovah, the God of Israel, with all his heart: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, wherewith he made Israel to sin.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	32	In those days Jehovah began to cut off from Israel: and Hazael smote them in all the borders of Israel;	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	33	from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	35	And Jehu slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	10	36	And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years.	12
ASV	2 Kings	11	1	Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.	12
ASV	2 Kings	11	2	But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the kings sons that were slain, even him and his nurse, and put them in the bedchamber; and they hid him from Athaliah, so that he w	12
ASV	2 Kings	11	3	And he was with her hid in the house of Jehovah six years. And Athaliah reigned over the land.	12
ASV	2 Kings	11	4	And in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought them to him into the house of Jehovah; and he made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of Jehovah, and showed	12
ASV	2 Kings	11	5	And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do: a third part of you, that come in on the sabbath, shall be keepers of the watch of the kings house;	12
ASV	2 Kings	11	6	And a third part shall be at the gate Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, and be a barrier.	12
ASV	2 Kings	11	7	And the two companies of you, even all that go forth on the sabbath, shall keep the watch of the house of Jehovah about the king.	12
ASV	2 Kings	11	8	And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and he that cometh within the ranks, let him be slain: and be ye with the king when he goeth out, and when he cometh in.	12
ASV	2 Kings	11	9	And the captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they took every man his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath, with those that were to go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.	12
ASV	2 Kings	11	10	And the priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king Davids, which were in the house of Jehovah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	11	11	And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about.	12
ASV	2 Kings	11	12	Then he brought out the kings son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, Long live the king.	12
ASV	2 Kings	11	13	And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the house of Jehovah:	12
ASV	2 Kings	11	14	and she looked, and, behold, the king stood by the pillar, as the manner was, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason! treason!	12
ASV	2 Kings	11	15	And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth between the ranks; and him that followeth her slay with the sword. For the priest said, Let her not be slain in the house of Jehovah	12
ASV	2 Kings	11	16	So they made way for her; and she went by the way of the horses entry to the kings house: and there was she slain.	12
ASV	2 Kings	11	17	And Jehoiada made a covenant between Jehovah and the king and the people, that they should be Jehovahs people; between the king also and the people.	12
ASV	2 Kings	11	18	And all the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of Jehovah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	11	19	And he took the captains over hundreds, and the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of Jehovah, and came by the way of the gate of the guard unto the kings house. And he sat on the throne o	12
ASV	2 Kings	11	20	So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. And Athaliah they had slain with the sword at the kings house.	12
ASV	2 Kings	11	21	Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign.	12
ASV	2 Kings	12	1	In the seventh year of Jehu began Jehoash to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.	12
ASV	2 Kings	12	2	And Jehoash did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.	12
ASV	2 Kings	12	3	Howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.	12
ASV	2 Kings	12	4	And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the hallowed things that is brought into the house of Jehovah, in current money, the money of the persons for whom each man is rated, and all the money that it cometh into any mans heart to bring into the	12
ASV	2 Kings	12	5	let the priests take it to them, every man from his acquaintance; and they shall repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found.	12
ASV	2 Kings	12	6	But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.	12
ASV	2 Kings	12	7	Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the other priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore take no more money from your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.	12
ASV	2 Kings	12	8	And the priests consented that they should take no more money from the people, neither repair the breaches of the house.	12
ASV	2 Kings	12	9	But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of Jehovah: and the priests that kept the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into the ho	12
ASV	2 Kings	12	10	And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the kings scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of Jehovah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	12	11	And they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of Jehovah: and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders, that wrought upon the house of Jehovah,	12
ASV	2 Kings	12	12	and to the masons and the hewers of stone, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the breaches of the house of Jehovah, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.	12
ASV	2 Kings	12	13	But there were not made for the house of Jehovah cups of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah;	12
ASV	2 Kings	12	14	for they gave that to them that did the work, and repaired therewith the house of Jehovah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	12	15	Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to give to them that did the work; for they dealt faithfully.	12
ASV	2 Kings	12	16	The money for the trespass-offerings, and the money for the sin-offerings, was not brought into the house of Jehovah: it was the priests.	12
ASV	2 Kings	12	17	Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.	12
ASV	2 Kings	12	18	And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and of the	12
ASV	2 Kings	12	19	Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?	12
ASV	2 Kings	12	20	And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and smote Joash at the house of Millo, on the way that goeth down to Silla.	12
ASV	2 Kings	12	21	For Jozacar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	1	In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned seventeen years.	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	3	And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, continually.	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	4	And Jehoahaz besought Jehovah, and Jehovah hearkened unto him; for he saw the oppression of Israel, how that the king of Syria oppressed them.	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	5	(And Jehovah gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents as beforetime.	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	6	Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, wherewith he made Israel to sin, but walked therein: and there remained the Asherah also in Samaria.)	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	7	For he left not to Jehoahaz of the people save fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria destroyed them, and made them like the dust in threshing.	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	9	And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	10	In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen years.	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	11	And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; but he walked therein.	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	12	Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	13	And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	14	Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died: and Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over him, and said, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof!	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	15	And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows; and he took unto him bow and arrows.	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	16	And he said to the king of Israel, Put thy hand upon the bow; and he put his hand upon it. And Elisha laid his hands upon the kings hands.	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	17	And he said, Open the window eastward; and he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot; and he shot. And he said, Jehovahs arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Syria; for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them.	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	18	And he said, Take the arrows; and he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground; and he smote thrice, and stayed.	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	19	And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times: then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it, whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	20	And Elisha died, and they buried him. Now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	21	And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	22	And Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	23	But Jehovah was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet.	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	24	And Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	13	25	And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash smite him, and recovered the cities of Israel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	1	In the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel began Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah to reign.	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	2	He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	3	And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, yet not like David his father: he did according to all that Joash his father had done.	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	4	Howbeit the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	5	And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, that he slew his servants who had slain the king his father:	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	6	but the children of the murderers he put not to death; according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, as Jehovah commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathe	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	7	He slew of Edom in the Valley of Salt ten thousand, and took Sela by war, and called the name of it Joktheel, unto this day.	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	8	Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	9	And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod down t	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	10	Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thy heart hath lifted thee up: glory thereof, and abide at home; for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	11	But Amaziah would not hear. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	12	And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	13	And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	14	And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the kings house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	15	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	16	And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	17	And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	18	Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	19	And they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	20	And they brought him upon horses; and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	21	And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	22	He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	23	In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years.	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	24	And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin.	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	25	He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath unto the sea of the Arabah, according to the word of Jehovah, the God of Israel, which he spake by his servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was of Gath-hepher.	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	26	For Jehovah saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter; for there was none shut up nor left at large, neither was there any helper for Israel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	27	And Jehovah said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven; but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	28	Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which had belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?	12
ASV	2 Kings	14	29	And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zechariah his son reigned in his stead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	1	In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	2	Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	3	And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	4	Howbeit the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	5	And Jehovah smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house. And Jotham the kings son was over the household, judging the people of the land.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	6	Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	7	And Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	8	In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	9	And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	10	And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	11	Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	12	This was the word of Jehovah which he spake unto Jehu, saying, Thy sons to the fourth generation shall sit upon the throne of Israel. And so it came to pass.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	13	Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned the space of a month in Samaria.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	14	And Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	15	Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	16	Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the borders thereof, from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	17	In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten years in Samaria.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	18	And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	19	There came against the land Pul the king of Assyria; and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	20	And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	21	Now the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	22	And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	23	In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two years.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	24	And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	25	And Pekah the son of Remaliah, his captain, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the castle of the kings house, with Argob and Arieh; and with him were fifty men of the Gileadites: and he slew him, and reigned in his stead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	26	Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	27	In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty years.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	28	And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	29	In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maacah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali; and he carried them captive to Assyria.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	30	And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	31	Now the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	32	In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	33	Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	34	And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	35	Howbeit the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places. He built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	36	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	37	In those days Jehovah began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	15	38	And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	16	1	In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.	12
ASV	2 Kings	16	2	Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he did not that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah his God, like David his father.	12
ASV	2 Kings	16	3	But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations, whom Jehovah cast out from before the children of Israel.	12
ASV	2 Kings	16	4	And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.	12
ASV	2 Kings	16	5	Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.	12
ASV	2 Kings	16	6	At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath; and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there, unto this day.	12
ASV	2 Kings	16	7	So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.	12
ASV	2 Kings	16	8	And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the kings house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.	12
ASV	2 Kings	16	9	And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.	12
ASV	2 Kings	16	10	And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar that was at Damascus; and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.	12
ASV	2 Kings	16	11	And Urijah the priest built an altar: according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so did Urijah the priest make it against the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus.	12
ASV	2 Kings	16	12	And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king drew near unto the altar, and offered thereon.	12
ASV	2 Kings	16	13	And he burnt his burnt-offering and his meal-offering, and poured his drink-offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace-offerings, upon the altar.	12
ASV	2 Kings	16	14	And the brazen altar, which was before Jehovah, he brought from the forefront of the house, from between his altar and the house of Jehovah, and put it on the north side of his altar.	12
ASV	2 Kings	16	15	And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt-offering, and the evening meal-offering, and the kings burnt-offering, and his meal-offering, with the burnt-offering of all the people of the land, and their m	12
ASV	2 Kings	16	16	Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.	12
ASV	2 Kings	16	17	And king Ahaz cut off the panels of the bases, and removed the laver from off them, and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stone.	12
ASV	2 Kings	16	18	And the covered way for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the kings entry without, turned he unto the house of Jehovah, because of the king of Assyria.	12
ASV	2 Kings	16	19	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?	12
ASV	2 Kings	16	20	And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	1	In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel, and reigned nine years.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, yet not as the kings of Israel that were before him.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	3	Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and brought him tribute.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	4	And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	5	Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	6	In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away unto Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	7	And it was so, because the children of Israel had sinned against Jehovah their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	8	and walked in the statutes of the nations, whom Jehovah cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they made.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	9	And the children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against Jehovah their God: and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city;	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	10	and they set them up pillars and Asherim upon every high hill, and under every green tree;	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	11	and there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the nations whom Jehovah carried away before them; and they wrought wicked things to provoke Jehovah to anger;	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	12	and they served idols, whereof Jehovah had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	13	Yet Jehovah testified unto Israel, and unto Judah, by every prophet, and every seer, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my serv	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	14	Notwithstanding, they would not hear, but hardened their neck, like to the neck of their fathers, who believed not in Jehovah their God.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	15	And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified unto them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the nations that were round about them, concerning whom Jehovah h	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	16	And they forsook all the commandments of Jehovah their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made an Asherah, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	17	And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	18	Therefore Jehovah was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	19	Also Judah kept not the commandments of Jehovah their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	20	And Jehovah rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	21	For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drove Israel from following Jehovah, and made them sin a great sin.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	22	And the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	23	until Jehovah removed Israel out of his sight, as he spake by all his servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	24	And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	25	And so it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not Jehovah: therefore Jehovah sent lions among them, which killed some of them.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	26	Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast carried away, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the law of the god of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	27	Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the law of the god of the land.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	28	So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear Jehovah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	29	Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	30	And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	31	and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	32	So they feared Jehovah, and made unto them from among themselves priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	33	They feared Jehovah, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	34	Unto this day they do after the former manner: they fear not Jehovah, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law or after the commandment which Jehovah commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	35	with whom Jehovah had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	36	but Jehovah, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, him shall ye fear, and unto him shall ye bow yourselves, and to him shall ye sacrifice:	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	37	and the statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods:	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	38	and the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods:	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	39	but Jehovah your God shall ye fear; and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	40	Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner.	12
ASV	2 Kings	17	41	So these nations feared Jehovah, and served their graven images; their children likewise, and their childrens children, as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	1	Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	2	Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	3	And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done.	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	4	He removed the high places, and brake the pillars, and cut down the Asherah: and he brake in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made; for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan.	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	5	He trusted in Jehovah, the God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor among them that were before him.	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	6	For he clave to Jehovah; he departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which Jehovah commanded Moses.	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	7	And Jehovah was with him; whithersoever he went forth he prospered: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	8	He smote the Philistines unto Gaza and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	9	And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	10	And at the end of three years they took it: in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	11	And the king of Assyria carried Israel away unto Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	12	because they obeyed not the voice of Jehovah their God, but transgressed his covenant, even all that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded, and would not hear it, nor do it.	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	13	Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	14	And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	15	And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the kings house.	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	16	At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of Jehovah, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	17	And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army unto Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	18	And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	19	And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	20	Thou sayest (but they are but vain words), There is counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled against me?	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	21	Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	22	But if ye say unto me, We trust in Jehovah our God; is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	23	Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	24	How then canst thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my masters servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	25	Am I now come up without Jehovah against this place to destroy it? Jehovah said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	26	Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not with us in the Jews language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	27	But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	28	Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews language, and spake, saying, Hear ye the word of the great king, the king of Assyria.	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	29	Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand:	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	30	neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	31	Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	32	Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive-trees and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, Jeh	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	33	Hath any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	34	Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	35	Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	36	But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the kings commandment was, saying, Answer him not.	12
ASV	2 Kings	18	37	Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	1	And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	2	And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	3	And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	4	It may be Jehovah thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Jehovah thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	5	So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	6	And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith Jehovah, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	7	Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear tidings, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	8	So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	9	And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee, he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying,	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	10	Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	11	Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	12	Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar?	12
ASV	2 Kings	19	13	Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	11	Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, that were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols;	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	12	therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Behold, I bring such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	13	And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	14	And I will cast off the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	15	because they have done that which is evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	16	Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	17	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	18	And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	19	Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	20	And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did Manasseh his father.	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	21	And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	22	and he forsook Jehovah, the God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of Jehovah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	23	And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and put the king to death in his own house.	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	24	But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	25	Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?	12
ASV	2 Kings	21	26	And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	22	1	Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.	12
ASV	2 Kings	22	2	And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.	12
ASV	2 Kings	22	3	And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of Jehovah, saying,	12
ASV	2 Kings	22	4	Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Jehovah, which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people:	12
ASV	2 Kings	22	5	and let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen that have the oversight of the house of Jehovah; and let them give it to the workmen that are in the house of Jehovah, to repair the breaches of the house,	12
ASV	2 Kings	22	6	unto the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the house.	12
ASV	2 Kings	22	7	Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand; for they dealt faithfully.	12
ASV	2 Kings	22	8	And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read it.	12
ASV	2 Kings	22	9	And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen that have the oversight of the house of Jehovah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	22	10	And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.	12
ASV	2 Kings	22	11	And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.	12
ASV	2 Kings	22	12	And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the kings servant, saying,	12
ASV	2 Kings	22	13	Go ye, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to	12
ASV	2 Kings	22	14	So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they communed	12
ASV	2 Kings	22	15	And she said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Tell ye the man that sent you unto me,	12
ASV	2 Kings	22	16	Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read.	12
ASV	2 Kings	22	17	Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched.	12
ASV	2 Kings	22	18	But unto the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: As touching the words which thou hast heard,	12
ASV	2 Kings	22	19	because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before Jehovah, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept befo	12
ASV	2 Kings	22	20	Therefore, behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	1	And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	2	And the king went up to the house of Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the c	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	3	And the king stood by the pillar, and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and all his soul, to confirm the words of this covenant that were written	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	4	And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring forth out of the temple of Jehovah all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the Asherah, and for all the host of heaven	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	5	And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to t	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	6	And he brought out the Asherah from the house of Jehovah, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and beat it to dust, and cast the dust thereof upon the graves of the common people.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	7	And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were in the house of Jehovah, where the women wove hangings for the Asherah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	8	And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beer-sheba; and he brake down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the govern	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	9	Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of Jehovah in Jerusalem, but they did eat unleavened bread among their brethren.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	10	And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	11	And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of Jehovah, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the precincts; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	12	And the altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of Jehovah, did the king break down, and beat them down from thence, and cast the d	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	13	And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom t	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	14	And he brake in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and filled their places with the bones of men.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	15	Moreover the altar that was at Beth-el, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he brake down; and he burned the high place and beat it to dust, and burned the Asherah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	16	And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount; and he sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of Jehovah which the man of God proclaimed, wh	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	17	Then he said, What monument is that which I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Beth-el.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	18	And he said, Let him be; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	19	And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke Jehovah to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Beth-el.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	20	And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there, upon the altars, and burned mens bones upon them; and he returned to Jerusalem.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	21	And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto Jehovah your God, as it is written in this book of the covenant.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	22	Surely there was not kept such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	23	but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah was this passover kept to Jehovah in Jerusalem.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	24	Moreover them that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	25	And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to Jehovah with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	26	Notwithstanding, Jehovah turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations wherewith Manasseh had provoked him.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	27	And Jehovah said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and I will cast off this city which I have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	28	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	29	In his days Pharaoh-necoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and Pharaoh-necoh slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	30	And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his fathers stead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	31	Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	32	And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his fathers had done.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	33	And Pharaoh-necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	34	And Pharaoh-necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim: but he took Jehoahaz away; and he came to Egypt, and died there.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	35	And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it unto P	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	36	Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	23	37	And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his fathers had done.	12
ASV	2 Kings	24	1	In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.	12
ASV	2 Kings	24	2	And Jehovah sent against him bands of the Chaldeans, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by his servants the p	12
ASV	2 Kings	24	3	Surely at the commandment of Jehovah came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did,	12
ASV	2 Kings	24	4	and also for the innocent blood that he shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood: and Jehovah would not pardon.	12
ASV	2 Kings	24	5	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?	12
ASV	2 Kings	24	6	So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.	12
ASV	2 Kings	24	7	And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land; for the king of Babylon had taken, from the brook of Egypt unto the river Euphrates, all that pertained to the king of Egypt.	12
ASV	2 Kings	24	8	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned in Jerusalem three months: and his mothers name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.	12
ASV	2 Kings	24	9	And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his father had done.	12
ASV	2 Kings	24	10	At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.	12
ASV	2 Kings	24	11	And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came unto the city, while his servants were besieging it;	12
ASV	2 Kings	24	12	and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.	12
ASV	2 Kings	24	13	And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the kings house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold, which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of Jehovah, as Jehovah had said.	12
ASV	2 Kings	24	14	And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths; none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.	12
ASV	2 Kings	24	15	And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon; and the kings mother, and the kings wives, and his officers, and the chief men of the land, carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.	12
ASV	2 Kings	24	16	And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths a thousand, all of them strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.	12
ASV	2 Kings	24	17	And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachins fathers brother, king is his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	24	18	Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	24	19	And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.	12
ASV	2 Kings	24	20	For through the anger of Jehovah did it come to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	1	And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	2	So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	3	On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	4	Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the kings garden (now the Chaldeans were against the city round about); and the king went by the way of the Arabah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	5	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	6	Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	7	And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon.	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	8	Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem.	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	9	And he burnt the house of Jehovah, and the kings house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burnt he with fire.	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	10	And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	11	And the residue of the people that were left in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away captive.	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	12	But the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	13	And the pillars of brass that were in the house of Jehovah, and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of Jehovah, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	14	And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	15	And the firepans, and the basins, that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	16	The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases, which Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah, the brass of all these vessels was without weight.	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	17	The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a capital of brass was upon it; and the height of the capital was three cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	18	And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	19	and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war; and five men of them that saw the kings face, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the peop	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	20	And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	21	And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	22	And as for the people that were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor.	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	23	Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	24	And Gedaliah sware to them and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not because of the servants of the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	25	But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, so that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah.	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	26	And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose, and came to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	27	And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, did lift up the he	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	28	and he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	29	and changed his prison garments. And Jehoiachin did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life:	12
ASV	2 Kings	25	30	and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him of the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life.	12

ASV	1 Chronicles	10	1	Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	10	2	And the Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	10	3	And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was distressed by reason of the archers.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	10	4	Then said Saul unto his armor-bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	10	5	And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	10	6	So Saul died, and his three sons; and all his house died together.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	10	7	And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	10	8	And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	10	9	And they stripped him, and took his head, and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the tidings unto their idols, and to the people.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	10	10	And they put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	10	11	And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	10	12	all the valiant men arose, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	10	13	So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against Jehovah, because of the word of Jehovah, which he kept not; and also for that he asked counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to inquire thereby,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	10	14	and inquired not of Jehovah: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	1	Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	2	In times past, even when Saul was king, it was thou that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and Jehovah thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt be shepherd of my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over my people Israel.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	3	So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of Jehovah by Samuel.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	4	And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (the same is Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	5	And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come in hither. Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	6	And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	7	And David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	8	And he built the city round about, from Millo even round about; and Joab repaired the rest of the city.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	9	And David waxed greater and greater; for Jehovah of hosts was with him.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	10	Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of Jehovah concerning Israel.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	11	And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them at one time.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	12	And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	13	He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	14	And they stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and Jehovah saved them by a great victory.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	15	And three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	16	And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	17	And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate!	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	18	And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto Jehovah,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	19	and said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	20	And Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	21	Of the three, he was more honorable than the two, and was made their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	22	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he slew the two sons of Ariel of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	23	And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptians hand was a spear like a weavers beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptians hand, and slew him with his own spear.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	24	These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	25	Behold, he was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three: and David set him over his guard.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	26	Also the mighty men of the armies: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	11	27	Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,	13

ASV	1 Chronicles	12	17	And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, my heart shall be knit unto you; but if ye be come to betray me to mine adversaries, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	12	18	Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the thirty, and he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thy helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and made them	13

ASV	1 Chronicles	12	39	And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking; for their brethren had made preparation for them.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	12	40	Moreover they that were nigh unto them, even as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, victuals of meal, cakes of figs, and clusters of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep in	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	13	1	And David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	13	2	And David said unto all the assembly of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and if it be of Jehovah our God, let us send abroad every where unto our brethren that are left in all the land of Israel, with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities that	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	13	3	and let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we sought not unto it in the days of Saul.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	13	4	And all the assembly said that they would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	13	5	So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor the brook of Egypt even unto the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	13	6	And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God Jehovah that sitteth above the cherubim, that is called by the Name.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	13	7	And they carried the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	13	8	And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, even with songs, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	13	9	And when they came unto the threshing-floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	13	10	And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put forth his hand to the ark; and there he died before God.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	13	11	And David was displeased, because Jehovah had broken forth upon Uzza; and he called that place Perez-uzza, unto this day.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	13	12	And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	13	13	So David removed not the ark unto him into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	13	14	And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months: and Jehovah blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	14	1	And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	14	2	And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel; for his kingdom was exalted on high, for his people Israels sake.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	14	3	And David took more wives at Jerusalem; and David begat more sons and daughters.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	14	4	And these are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	14	5	and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	14	6	and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	14	7	and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	14	8	And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out against them.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	14	9	Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	14	10	And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thy hand.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	14	11	So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and David said, God hath broken mine enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	14	12	And they left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	14	13	And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	14	14	And David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Thou shalt not go up after them: turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	14	15	And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle; for God is gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	14	16	And David did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	14	17	And the fame of David went out into all lands; and Jehovah brought the fear of him upon all nations.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	1	And David made him houses in the city of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	2	Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath Jehovah chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	3	And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Jehovah unto its place, which he had prepared for it.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	4	And David gathered together the sons of Aaron, and the Levites:	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	5	of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twenty;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	6	of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	7	of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and thirty;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	8	of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	9	of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	10	of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	11	And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	12	and said unto them, Ye are the heads of the fathers houses of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto the place that I have prepared for it.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	13	For because ye bare it not at the first, Jehovah our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not according to the ordinance.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	14	So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Jehovah, the God of Israel.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	15	And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of Jehovah.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	16	And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren the singers, with instruments of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	17	So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	18	and with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	19	So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed with cymbals of brass to sound aloud;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	20	and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries set to Alamoth;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	21	and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps set to the Sheminith, to lead.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	22	And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	23	And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	24	And Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	25	So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the house of Obed-edom with joy.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	26	And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, that they sacrificed seven bullocks and seven rams.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	27	And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: and David had upon him an ephod of linen.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	28	Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with psalteries and harps.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	15	29	And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	1	And they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	2	And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	3	And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion of flesh, and a cake of raisins.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	4	And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of Jehovah, and to celebrate and to thank and praise Jehovah, the God of Israel:	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	5	Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with psalteries and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	6	and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	7	Then on that day did David first ordain to give thanks unto Jehovah, by the hand of Asaph and his brethren.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	8	O give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name; Make known his doings among the peoples.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	9	Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; Talk ye of all his marvellous works.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	10	Glory ye in his holy name; Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	11	Seek ye Jehovah and his strength; Seek his face evermore.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	12	Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	13	O ye seed of Israel his servant, Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	14	He is Jehovah our God; His judgments are in all the earth.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	15	Remember his covenant for ever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	16	The covenant which he made with Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	17	And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	18	Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	19	When ye were but a few men in number, Yea, very few, and sojourners in it;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	20	And they went about from nation to nation, And from one kingdom to another people.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	21	He suffered no man to do them wrong; Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	22	Saying, Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	23	Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth; Show forth his salvation from day to day.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	24	Declare his glory among the nations, His marvellous works among all the peoples.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	25	For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised: He also is to be feared above all gods.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	26	For all the gods of the peoples are idols: But Jehovah made the heavens.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	27	Honor and majesty are before him: Strength and gladness are in his place.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	28	Ascribe unto Jehovah, ye kindreds of the peoples, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	29	Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name: Bring an offering, and come before him: Worship Jehovah in holy array.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	30	Tremble before him, all the earth: The world also is established that it cannot be moved.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	31	Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; And let them say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	32	Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; Let the field exult, and all that is therein;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	33	Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy before Jehovah; For he cometh to judge the earth.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	34	O give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	35	And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, And gather us together and deliver us from the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	36	Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And all the people said, Amen, and praised Jehovah.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	37	So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every days work required;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	38	and Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	39	and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah in the high place that was at Gibeon,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	40	to offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah upon the altar of burnt-offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of Jehovah, which he commanded unto Israel;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	41	and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to Jehovah, because his lovingkindness endureth for ever;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	42	and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and with instruments for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	16	43	And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	1	And it came to pass, when David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah dwelleth under curtains.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	2	And Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thy heart; for God is with thee.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	3	And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	4	Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith Jehovah, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in:	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	5	for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, unto this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	6	In all places wherein I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar?	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	7	Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people Israel:	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	8	and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	9	And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	10	and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all thine enemies. Moreover I tell thee that Jehovah will build thee a house.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	11	And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	12	He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	13	I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	14	but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	15	According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	16	Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	17	And this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; but thou hast spoken of thy servants house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Jehovah God.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	18	What can David say yet more unto thee concerning the honor which is done to thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	19	O Jehovah, for thy servants sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make known all these great things.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	20	O Jehovah, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	21	And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, to make thee a name by great and terrible things, in driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou redeemest out of Egypt?	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	22	For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	23	And now, O Jehovah, let the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	24	And let thy name be established and magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and the house of David thy servant is established before thee.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	25	For thou, O my God, hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build him a house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray before thee.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	26	And now, O Jehovah, thou art God, and hast promised this good thing unto thy servant:	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	17	27	and now it hath pleased thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Jehovah, hast blessed, and it is blessed for ever.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	18	1	And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	18	2	And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	18	3	And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	18	4	And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David hocked all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	18	5	And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadarezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	18	6	Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	18	7	And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	18	8	And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadarezer, David took very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	18	9	And when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	18	10	he sent Hadoram his son to king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadarezer and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had wars with Tou;) and he had with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	18	11	These also did king David dedicate unto Jehovah, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	18	12	Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah smote of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt eighteen thousand.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	18	13	And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	18	14	And David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and righteousness unto all his people.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	18	15	And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	18	16	and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Shavsha was scribe;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	18	17	and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	19	1	And it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	19	2	And David said, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And Davids servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfor	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	19	3	But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, in that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	19	4	So Hanun took Davids servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	19	5	Then there went certain persons, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	19	6	And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Arammaacah, and out of Zobah.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	19	7	So they hired them thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	19	8	And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	19	9	And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	19	10	Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	19	11	And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	19	12	And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	19	13	Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Jehovah do that which seemeth him good.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	19	14	So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	19	15	And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	19	16	And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	19	17	And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	19	18	And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians the men of seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	19	19	And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and served him: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	20	1	And it came to pass, at the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go out to battle, that Joab led forth the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smot	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	20	2	And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon Davids head: and he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	20	3	And he brought forth the people that were therein, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. And thus did David unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	20	4	And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines: then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Sippai, of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	20	5	And there was again war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weavers beam.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	20	6	And there was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot; and he also was born unto the giant.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	20	7	And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea Davids brother slew him.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	20	8	These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	1	And Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	2	And David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	3	And Joab said, Jehovah make his people a hundred times as many as they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lords servants? why doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of guilt unto Israel?	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	4	Nevertheless the kings word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	5	And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	6	But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them; for the kings word was abominable to Joab.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	7	And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	8	And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing: but now, put away, I beseech thee, the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	9	And Jehovah spake unto Gad, Davids seer, saying,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	10	Go and speak unto David, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	11	So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Take which thou wilt:	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	12	either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before thy foes, while the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of Jehovah, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Jehovah destroying throughout all the bo	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	13	And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Jehovah; for very great are his mercies: and let me not fall into the hand of man.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	14	So Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	15	And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was about to destroy, Jehovah beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now stay thy hand. And the angel of Jehovah was standing by the threshing-	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	16	And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Jehovah standing between earth and heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	17	And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, O Jehovah my God, be against me, and against my fathers h	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	18	Then the angel of Jehovah commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and rear an altar unto Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	19	And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of Jehovah.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	20	And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons that were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	21	And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	22	Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar unto Jehovah: for the full price shalt thou give it me, that the plague may be stayed from the people.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	23	And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen for burnt-offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal-offering; I give it all.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	24	And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for Jehovah, nor offer a burnt-offering without cost.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	25	So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	26	And David built there an altar unto Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon Jehovah; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	27	And Jehovah commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	28	At that time, when David saw that Jehovah had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	29	For the tabernacle of Jehovah, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	21	30	But David could not go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Jehovah.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	22	1	Then David said, This is the house of Jehovah God, and this is the altar of burnt-offering for Israel.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	22	2	And David commanded to gather together the sojourners that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	22	3	And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass in abundance without weight;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	22	4	and cedar-trees without number: for the Sidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar-trees in abundance to David.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	22	5	And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for Jehovah must be exceeding magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	22	6	Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for Jehovah, the God of Israel.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	22	7	And David said to Solomon his son, As for me, it was in my heart to build a house unto the name of Jehovah my God.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	22	8	But the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build a house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	22	9	Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days:	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	22	10	he shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	22	11	Now, my son, Jehovah be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of Jehovah thy God, as he hath spoken concerning thee.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	22	12	Only Jehovah give thee discretion and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel; that so thou mayest keep the law of Jehovah thy God.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	22	13	Then shalt thou prosper, if thou observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Jehovah charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; fear not, neither be dismayed.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	22	14	Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Jehovah a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver, and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	22	15	Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all men that are skilful in every manner of work:	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	22	16	of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and Jehovah be with thee.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	22	17	David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	22	18	Is not Jehovah your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before Jehovah, and before his people.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	22	19	Now set your heart and your soul to seek after Jehovah your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of Jehovah God, to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of Jehova	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	1	Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	2	And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	3	And the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	4	Of these, twenty and four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of Jehovah; and six thousand were officers and judges;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	5	and four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised Jehovah with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	6	And David divided them into courses according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	7	Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	8	The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	9	The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers houses of Ladan.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	10	And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	11	And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they became a fathers house in one reckoning.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	12	The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	13	The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons, for ever, to burn incense before Jehovah, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, for ever.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	14	But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	15	The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	16	The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	17	And the sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	18	The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	19	The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	20	The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	21	The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	22	And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them to wife.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	23	The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	24	These were the sons of Levi after their fathers houses, even the heads of the fathers houses of those of them that were counted, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of the house of Jehovah, from twenty years old and upw	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	25	For David said, Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath given rest unto his people; and he dwelleth in Jerusalem for ever:	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	26	and also the Levites shall no more have need to carry the tabernacle and all the vessels of it for the service thereof.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	27	For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered, from twenty years old and upward.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	28	For their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of the house of God;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	29	for the showbread also, and for the fine flour for a meal-offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all manner of measure and size;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	30	and to stand every morning to thank and praise Jehovah, and likewise at even;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	31	and to offer all burnt-offerings unto Jehovah, on the sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before Jehovah;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	23	32	and that they should keep the charge of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, for the service of the house of Jehovah.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	1	And the courses of the sons of Aaron were these. The sons of Aaron: Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	2	But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priests office.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	3	And David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their ordering in their service.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	4	And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and thus were they divided: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers houses, eight.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	5	Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	6	And Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers houses of the priests and of the Levites; o	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	7	Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	8	the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	9	the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	10	the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	11	the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	12	the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	13	the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	14	the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	15	the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	16	the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	17	the one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	18	the three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	19	This was the ordering of them in their service, to come into the house of Jehovah according to the ordinance given unto them by Aaron their father, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, had commanded him.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	20	And of the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	21	Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	22	Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	23	And the sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	24	The sons of Uzziel, Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	25	The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	26	The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi; the sons of Jaaziah: Beno.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	27	The sons of Merari: of Jaaziah, Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	28	Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	29	Of Kish; the sons of Kish: Jerahmeel.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	24	30	And the sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after their fathers houses.	13

ASV	1 Chronicles	28	3	But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build a house for my name, because thou art a man of war, and hast shed blood.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	28	4	Howbeit Jehovah, the God of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in m	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	28	5	And of all my sons (for Jehovah hath given me many sons), he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of Jehovah over Israel.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	28	6	And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	28	7	And I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and mine ordinances, as at this day.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	28	8	Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of Jehovah, and in the audience of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of Jehovah your God; that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children after y	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	28	9	And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for Jehovah searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; bu	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	28	10	Take heed now; for Jehovah hath chosen thee to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	28	11	Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch of the temple, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper rooms thereof, and of the inner chambers thereof, and of the place of the mercy-seat;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	28	12	and the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, for the courts of the house of Jehovah, and for all the chambers round about, for the treasuries of the house of God, and for the treasuries of the dedicated things;	13

ASV	1 Chronicles	28	19	All this, said David, have I been made to understand in writing from the hand of Jehovah, even all the works of this pattern.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	28	20	And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed; for Jehovah God, even my God, is with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until all the work for the service of the house of Jehovah be fini	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	28	21	And, behold, there are the courses of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with thee in all manner of work every willing man that hath skill, for any manner of service: also the captains and all the peop	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	1	And David the king said unto all the assembly, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for Jehovah God.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	2	Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the things of gold, and the silver for the things of silver, and the brass for the things of brass, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood; onyx stones, a	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	3	Moreover also, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, seeing that I have a treasure of mine own of gold and silver, I give it unto the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	4	even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, wherewith to overlay the walls of the houses;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	5	of gold for the things of gold, and of silver for the things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. Who then offereth willingly to consecrate himself this day unto Jehovah?	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	6	Then the princes of the fathers houses, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the kings work, offered willingly;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	7	and they gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and of iron a hundred thousand talents.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	8	And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Jehovah, under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	9	Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Jehovah: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	10	Wherefore David blessed Jehovah before all the assembly; and David said, Blessed be thou, O Jehovah, the God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	11	Thine, O Jehovah, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O Jehovah, and thou art exalted as head above all.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	12	Both riches and honor come of thee, and thou rulest over all; and in thy hand is power and might; and in thy hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	13	Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	14	But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	15	For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as all our fathers were: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no abiding.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	16	O Jehovah our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house for thy holy name cometh of thy hand, and is all thine own.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	17	I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, that are present here, offer willingly unto th	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	18	O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee;	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	19	and give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	20	And David said to all the assembly, Now bless Jehovah your God. And all the assembly blessed Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped Jehovah, and the king.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	21	And they sacrificed sacrifices unto Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings unto Jehovah, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	22	and did eat and drink before Jehovah on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto Jehovah to be prince, and Zadok to be priest.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	23	Then Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	24	And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	25	And Jehovah magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	26	Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	27	And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	28	And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	29	Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,	13
ASV	1 Chronicles	29	30	with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.	13
ASV	2 Chronicles	1	1	And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and Jehovah his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	1	2	And Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers houses.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	1	3	So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	1	4	But the ark of God had David brought up from Kiriath-jearim to the place that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	1	5	Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of Jehovah: and Solomon and the assembly sought unto it.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	1	6	And Solomon went up thither to the brazen altar before Jehovah, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt-offerings upon it.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	1	7	In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	1	8	And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast showed great lovingkindness unto David my father, and hast made me king in his stead.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	1	9	Now, O Jehovah God, let thy promise unto David my father be established; for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	1	10	Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	1	11	And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of them that hate thee, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my peo	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	1	12	wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee; neither shall there any after thee have the like.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	1	13	So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, unto Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	1	14	And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	1	15	And the king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	1	16	And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; the kings merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	1	17	And they fetched up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	2	1	Now Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	2	2	And Solomon counted out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand men that were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	2	3	And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him a house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	2	4	Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him incense of sweet spices, and for the continual showbread, and for the burnt-offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new mo	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	2	5	And the house which I build is great; for great is our God above all gods.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	2	6	But who is able to build him a house, seeing heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him a house, save only to burn incense before him?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	2	7	Now therefore send me a man skilful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that knoweth how to grave all manner of gravings, to be with the skilful men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusale	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	2	8	Send me also cedar-trees, fir-trees, and algum-trees, out of Lebanon; for I know that thy servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon: and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	2	9	even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	2	10	And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	2	11	Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because Jehovah loveth his people, he hath made thee king over them.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	2	12	Huram said moreover, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with discretion and understanding, that should build a house for Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	2	13	And now I have sent a skilful man, endued with understanding, of Huram my fathers,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	2	14	the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan; and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson, also to grave any manner of graving, a	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	2	15	Now therefore the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	2	16	and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need; and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	2	17	And Solomon numbered all the sojourners that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	2	18	And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people at work.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	3	1	Then Solomon began to build the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem on mount Moriah, where Jehovah appeared unto David his father, which he made ready in the place that David had appointed, in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	3	2	And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	3	3	Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	3	4	And the porch that was before the house, the length of it, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height a hundred and twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	3	5	And the greater house he ceiled with fir-wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and wrought thereon palm-trees and chains.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	3	6	And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	3	7	He overlaid also the house, the beams, the thresholds, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubim on the walls.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	3	8	And he made the most holy house: the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	3	9	And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	3	10	And in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work; and they overlaid them with gold.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	3	11	And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	3	12	And the wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	3	13	The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	3	14	And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim thereon.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	3	15	Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	3	16	And he made chains in the oracle, and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	3	17	And he set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	4	1	Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	4	2	Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass; and the height thereof was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	4	3	And under it was the likeness of oxen, which did compass it round about, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	4	4	It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	4	5	And it was a handbreadth thick; and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it received and held three thousand baths.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	4	6	He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as belonged to the burnt-offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	4	7	And he made the ten candlesticks of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	4	8	He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made a hundred basins of gold.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	4	9	Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	4	10	And he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	4	11	And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. So Huram made an end of doing the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of God:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	4	12	the two pillars, and the bowls, and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	4	13	and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	4	14	He made also the bases, and the lavers made he upon the bases;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	4	15	one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	4	16	The pots also, and the shovels, and the flesh-hooks, and all the vessels thereof, did Huram his father make for king Solomon for the house of Jehovah of bright brass.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	4	17	In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	4	18	Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	4	19	And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon was the showbread;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	4	20	and the candlesticks with their lamps, to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	4	21	and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	4	22	and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the firepans, of pure gold: and as for the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple, were of gold.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	5	1	Thus all the work that Solomon wrought for the house of Jehovah was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of God.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	5	2	Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers houses of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	5	3	nd all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king at the feast, which was in the seventh month.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	5	4	And all the elders of Israel came: and the Levites took up the ark;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	5	5	and they brought up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these did the priests the Levites bring up.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	5	6	And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	5	7	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	5	8	For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	5	9	And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without: and there it is unto this day.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	5	10	There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put there at Horeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	5	11	And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, (for all the priests that were present had sanctified themselves, and did not keep their courses;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	5	12	also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brethren, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priest	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	5	13	it came to pass, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking Jehovah; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Jehovah, saying, For he i	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	5	14	so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of God.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	1	Then spake Solomon, Jehovah hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	2	But I have built thee a house of habitation, and a place for thee to dwell in for ever.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	3	And the king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	4	And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hands fulfilled it, saying,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	5	Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be prince over my people Israel:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	6	but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	7	Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	8	But Jehovah said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	9	nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	10	And Jehovah hath performed his word that he spake; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	11	And there have I set the ark, wherein is the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with the children of Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	12	And he stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	13	(for Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth hi	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	14	and he said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven, or on earth; who keepest covenant and lovingkindness with thy servants, that walk before thee with all their heart;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	15	who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him: yea, thou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	16	Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	17	Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	18	But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have builded!	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	19	Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	20	that thine eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	21	And hearken thou to the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yea, hear thou from thy dwelling-place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest forgive.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	22	If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and he come and swear before thine altar in this house;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	23	then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, requiting the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	24	And if thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	25	then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	26	When the heavens are shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	27	then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	28	If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague or whatsoever sickness there be;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	29	what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, who shall know every man his own plague and his own sorrow, and shall spread forth his hands toward this house:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	30	then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling-place and forgive, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of the children of men;)	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	31	that they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	32	Moreover concerning the foreigner, that is not of thy people Israel, when he shall come from a far country for thy great names sake, and thy mighty hand, and thine outstretched arm; when they shall come and pray toward this house:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	33	then hear thou from heaven, even from thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calleth to thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	34	If thy people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatsoever way thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	35	then hear thou from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	36	If they sin against thee (for there is no man that sinneth not), and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto a land far off or near;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	37	yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have dealt wickedly;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	38	if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and the city which thou hast chosen, and toward	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	39	then hear thou from heaven, even from thy dwelling-place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	40	Now, O my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent, unto the prayer that is made in this place.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	41	Now therefore arise, O Jehovah God, into thy resting-place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O Jehovah God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	6	42	O Jehovah God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember thy lovingkindnesses to David thy servant.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	7	1	Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt-offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of Jehovah filled the house.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	7	2	And the priests could not enter into the house of Jehovah, because the glory of Jehovah filled Jehovahs house.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	7	3	And all the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and the glory of Jehovah was upon the house; and they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and gave thanks unto Jehovah, saying, For he is goo	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	7	4	Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	7	5	And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	7	6	And the priests stood, according to their offices; the Levites also with instruments of music of Jehovah, which David the king had made to give thanks unto Jehovah, (for his lovingkindness endureth for ever,) when David praised by their ministry: and the	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	7	7	Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt-offerin	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	7	8	So Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	7	9	And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	7	10	And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away unto their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Jehovah had showed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	7	11	Thus Solomon finished the house of Jehovah, and the kings house: and all that came into Solomons heart to make in the house of Jehovah, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	7	12	And Jehovah appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	7	13	If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	7	14	if my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	7	15	Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent, unto the prayer that is made in this place.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	7	16	For now have I chosen and hallowed this house, that my name may be there for ever; and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	7	17	And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	7	18	then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	7	19	But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	7	20	then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	7	21	And this house, which is so high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall say, Why hath Jehovah done thus unto this land, and to this house?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	7	22	And they shall answer, Because they forsook Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	8	1	And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of Jehovah, and his own house,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	8	2	that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	8	3	And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	8	4	And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store-cities, which he built in Hamath.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	8	5	Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	8	6	and Baalath, and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	8	7	As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, that were not of Israel;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	8	8	of their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, of them did Solomon raise a levy of bondservants unto this day.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	8	9	But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	8	10	And these were the chief officers of king Solomon, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	8	11	And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her; for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of Jehovah hath com	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	8	12	Then Solomon offered burnt-offerings unto Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah, which he had built before the porch,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	8	13	even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the fea	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	8	14	And he appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise, and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers also by thei	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	8	15	And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	8	16	Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of Jehovah, and until it was finished. So the house of Jehovah was completed.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	8	17	Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	8	18	And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and fetched from thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	1	And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great train, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she c	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	2	And Solomon told her all her questions; and there was not anything hid from Solomon which he told her not.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	3	And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	4	and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, his cupbearers also, and their apparel, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of Jehovah; there was no more spirit in her.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	5	And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	6	Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it; and, behold, the half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: thou exceedest the fame that I heard.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	7	Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, that stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	8	Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on his throne, to be king for Jehovah thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do justice and righteousness.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	9	And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	10	And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, that brought gold from Ophir, brought algum-trees and precious stones.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	11	And the king made of the algum-trees terraces for the house of Jehovah, and for the kings house, and harps and psalteries for the singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	12	And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, besides that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	13	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	14	besides that which the traders and merchants brought: and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	15	And king Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one buckler.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	16	And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	17	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	18	nd there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	19	And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	20	And all king Solomons drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	21	For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years came the ships of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	22	So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	23	And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	24	And they brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	25	And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	26	And he ruled over all the kings from the River even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	27	And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	28	And they brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt, and out of all lands.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	29	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	30	And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	9	31	And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	10	1	And Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	10	2	And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it, (for he was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of king Solomon,) that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	10	3	And they sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spake to Rehoboam, saying,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	10	4	Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	10	5	And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	10	6	And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	10	7	And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	10	8	But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	10	9	And he said unto them, What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	10	10	And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou say unto the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger is th	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	10	11	And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	10	12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	10	13	And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	10	14	and spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	10	15	So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was brought about of God, that Jehovah might establish his word, which he spake by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	10	16	And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So a	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	10	17	But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	10	18	Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to taskwork; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	10	19	So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	11	1	And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, that were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	11	2	But the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	11	3	Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	11	4	Thus saith Jehovah, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house; for this thing is of me. So they hearkened unto the words of Jehovah, and returned from going against Jeroboam.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	11	5	And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	11	6	He built Beth-lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	11	7	And Beth-zur, and Soco, and Adullam,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	11	8	and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	11	9	and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	11	10	and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	11	11	And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of victuals, and oil and wine.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	11	12	And in every city he put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong. And Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	11	13	And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	11	14	For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priests office unto Jehovah;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	11	15	and he appointed him priests for the high places, and for the he-goats, and for the calves which he had made.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	11	16	And after them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice unto Jehovah, the God of their fathers.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	11	17	So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	11	18	And Rehoboam took him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	11	19	and she bare him sons: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	11	20	And after her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	11	21	And Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines, and begat twenty and eight sons and threescore daughters.)	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	11	22	And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, even the prince among his brethren; for he was minded to make him king.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	11	23	And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fortified city: and he gave them victuals in abundance. And he sought for them many wives.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	12	1	And it came to pass, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and he was strong, that he forsook the law of Jehovah, and all Israel with him.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	12	2	And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had trespassed against Jehovah,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	12	3	with twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen. And the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	12	4	And he took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and came unto Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	12	5	Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, Ye have forsaken me, therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	12	6	Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, Jehovah is righteous.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	12	7	And when Jehovah saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves: I will not destroy them; but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	12	8	Nevertheless they shall be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	12	9	So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the kings house: he took all away: he took away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	12	10	And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, that kept the door of the kings house.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	12	11	And it was so, that, as oft as the king entered into the house of Jehovah, the guard came and bare them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	12	12	And when he humbled himself, the wrath of Jehovah turned from him, so as not to destroy him altogether: and moreover in Judah there were good things found.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	12	13	So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his na	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	12	14	And he did that which was evil, because he set not his heart to seek Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	12	15	Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, after the manner of genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	12	16	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	13	1	In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	13	2	Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	13	3	And Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	13	4	And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	13	5	Ought ye not to know that Jehovah, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	13	6	Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	13	7	And there were gathered unto him worthless men, base fellows, that strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	13	8	And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	13	9	Have ye not driven out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made you priests after the manner of the peoples of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a p	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	13	10	But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and we have priests ministering unto Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	13	11	and they burn unto Jehovah every morning and every evening burnt-offerings and sweet incense: the showbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of Je	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	13	12	And, behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against Jehovah, the God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	13	13	But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	13	14	And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried unto Jehovah, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	13	15	Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	13	16	And the children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	13	17	And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	13	18	Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon Jehovah, the God of their fathers.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	13	19	And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephron with the towns thereof.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	13	20	Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and Jehovah smote him, and he died.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	13	21	But Abijah waxed mighty, and took unto himself fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	13	22	And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	14	1	So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	14	2	And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Jehovah his God:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	14	3	for he took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and brake down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	14	4	and commanded Judah to seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	14	5	Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	14	6	And he built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Jehovah had given him rest.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	14	7	For he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought Jehovah our God; we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and pr	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	14	8	And Asa had an army that bare bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	14	9	And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he came unto Mareshah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	14	10	Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	14	11	And Asa cried unto Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, there is none besides thee to help, between the mighty and him that hath no strength: help us, O Jehovah our God; for we rely on thee, and in thy name are we come against this multitude. O Jehovah, th	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	14	12	So Jehovah smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	14	13	And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Jehovah, and before his host; and they carried away very much booty.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	14	14	And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of Jehovah came upon them: and they despoiled all the cities; for there was much spoil in them.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	14	15	They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	15	1	And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	15	2	and he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: Jehovah is with you, while ye are with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	15	3	Now for a long season Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	15	4	But when in their distress they turned unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	15	5	And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in; but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the lands.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	15	6	And they were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city; for God did vex them with all adversity.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	15	7	But be ye strong, and let not your hands be slack; for your work shall be rewarded.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	15	8	And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill-country of Ephraim; and he renewed the a	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	15	9	And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and them that sojourned with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	15	10	So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	15	11	And they sacrificed unto Jehovah in that day, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	15	12	And they entered into the covenant to seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	15	13	and that whosoever would not seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	15	14	And they sware unto Jehovah with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	15	15	And all Judah rejoiced at the oath; for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and Jehovah gave them rest round about.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	15	16	And also Maacah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and made dust of it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	15	17	But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	15	18	And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	15	19	And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	16	1	In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	16	2	Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Jehovah and of the kings house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	16	3	There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	16	4	And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store-cities of Naphtali.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	16	5	And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building Ramah, and let his work cease.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	16	6	Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	16	7	And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and hast not relied on Jehovah thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thy hand.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	16	8	Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge host, with chariots and horsemen exceeding many? yet, because thou didst rely on Jehovah, he delivered them into thy hand.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	16	9	For the eyes of Jehovah run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly; for from henceforth thou shalt have wars.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	16	10	Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in the prison-house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	16	11	And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	16	12	And in the thirty and ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet; his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to Jehovah, but to the physicians.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	16	13	And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	16	14	And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had hewn out for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds of spices prepared by the perfumers art: and they made a very great burning for h	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	17	1	And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	17	2	And he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	17	3	And Jehovah was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto the Baalim,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	17	4	but sought to the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	17	5	Therefore Jehovah established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat tribute; and he had riches and honor in abundance.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	17	6	And his heart was lifted up in the ways of Jehovah: and furthermore he took away the high places and the Asherim out of Judah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	17	7	Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben-hail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	17	8	and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	17	9	And they taught in Judah, having the book of the law of Jehovah with them; and they went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught among the people.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	17	10	And the fear of Jehovah fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	17	11	And some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and silver for tribute; the Arabians also brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he-goats.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	17	12	And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles and cities of store.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	17	13	And he had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	17	14	And this was the numbering of them according to their fathers houses: Of Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	17	15	and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	17	16	and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto Jehovah; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	17	17	And of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	17	18	and next to him Jehozabad and with him a hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for war.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	17	19	These were they that waited on the king, besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	1	Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance; and he joined affinity with Ahab.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	2	And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that were with him, and moved him to go up with him to Ramoth-gilead.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	3	And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	4	And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray thee, for the word of Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	5	Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the hand of the king.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	6	But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we may inquire of him?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	7	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah: but I hate him; for he never prophesieth good concerning me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	8	Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	9	Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	10	And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until they be consumed.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	11	And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	12	And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth: let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	13	And Micaiah said, As Jehovah liveth, what my God saith, that will I speak.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	14	And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper; and they shall be delivered into your hand.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	15	And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	16	And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Jehovah said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	17	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	18	And Micaiah said, Therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	19	And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	20	And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him. And Jehovah said unto him, Wherewith?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	21	And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also: go forth, and do so.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	22	Now therefore, behold, Jehovah hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets; and Jehovah hath spoken evil concerning thee.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	23	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Jehovah from me to speak unto thee?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	24	And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	25	And the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the kings son;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	26	and say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	27	And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, Jehovah hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	28	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	29	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into the battle.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	30	Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	31	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they turned about to fight against him: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and Jehovah helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	32	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	33	And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor: wherefore he said to the driver of the chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	18	34	And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even; and about the time of the going down of the sun he died.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	19	1	And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	19	2	And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the wicked, and love them that hate Jehovah? for this thing wrath is upon thee from before Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	19	3	Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast put away the Asheroth out of the land, and hast set thy heart to seek God.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	19	4	And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba to the hill-country of Ephraim, and brought them back unto Jehovah, the God of their fathers.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	19	5	And he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	19	6	and said to the judges, Consider what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for Jehovah; and he is with you in the judgment.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	19	7	Now therefore let the fear of Jehovah be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with Jehovah our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	19	8	Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites and the priests, and of the heads of the fathers houses of Israel, for the judgment of Jehovah, and for controversies. And they returned to Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	19	9	And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of Jehovah, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	19	10	And whensoever any controversy shall come to you from your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, ye shall warn them, that they be not guilty towards Jehovah, and so wrath come u	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	19	11	And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of Jehovah; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all the kings matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and Jehovah be with	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	1	And it came to pass after this, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them some of the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	2	Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea from Syria; and, behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar (the same is En-gedi).	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	3	And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek unto Jehovah; and he proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	4	And Judah gathered themselves together, to seek help of Jehovah: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	5	And Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of Jehovah, before the new court;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	6	and he said, O Jehovah, the God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and art not thou ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? and in thy hand is power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	7	Didst not thou, O our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and give it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	8	And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	9	If evil come upon us, the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house, and before thee, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, and thou wilt hear and save.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	10	And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them, and destroyed them not;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	11	behold, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	12	O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but out eyes are upon thee.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	13	And all Judah stood before Jehovah, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	14	Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of Jehovah in the midst of the assembly;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	15	and he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat: Thus saith Jehovah unto you, Fear not ye, neither be dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but Gods.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	16	To-morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the ascent of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	17	Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of Jehovah with you, O Judah and Jerusalem; fear not, nor be dismayed: to-morrow go out against them: for Jehovah is with you.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	18	And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Jehovah, worshipping Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	19	And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites, stood up to praise Jehovah, the God of Israel, with an exceeding loud voice.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	20	And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem: believe in Jehovah your God, so shall ye be established; believe his pr	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	21	And when he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed them that should sing unto Jehovah, and give praise in holy array, as they went out before the army, and say, Give thanks unto Jehovah; for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	22	And when they began to sing and to praise, Jehovah set liers-in-wait against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, that were come against Judah; and they were smitten.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	23	For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	24	And when Judah came to the watch-tower of the wilderness, they looked upon the multitude; and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none that escaped.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	25	And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in t	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	26	And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah; for there they blessed Jehovah: therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Beracah unto this day.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	27	Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for Jehovah had made them to rejoice over their enemies.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	28	And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	29	And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries, when they heard that Jehovah fought against the enemies of Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	30	So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet; for his God gave him rest round about.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	31	And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	32	And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	33	Howbeit the high places were not taken away; neither as yet had the people set their hearts unto the God of their fathers.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is inserted in the book of the kings of Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	35	And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel; the same did very wickedly:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	36	and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish; and they made the ships in Ezion-geber.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	20	37	Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, Jehovah hath destroyed thy works. And the ships were broken, so that they were not able to go to Tarshish.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	21	1	And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	21	2	And he had brethren, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	21	3	And their father gave them great gifts, of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram, because he was the first-born.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	21	4	Now when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father, and had strengthened himself, he slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	21	5	Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	21	6	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	21	7	Howbeit Jehovah would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his children alway.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	21	8	In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	21	9	Then Jehoram passed over with his captains, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites that compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	21	10	So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day: then did Libnah revolt at the same time from under his hand, because he had forsaken Jehovah, the God of his fathers.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	21	11	Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot, and led Judah astray.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	21	12	And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	21	13	but hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot, like as the house of Ahab did, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy fathers house, who were better than thyself:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	21	14	behold, Jehovah will smite with a great plague thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy substance;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	21	15	and thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness, day by day.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	21	16	And Jehovah stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians that are beside the Ethiopians:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	21	17	and they came up against Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the kings house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	21	18	And after all this Jehovah smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	21	19	And it came to pass, in process of time, at the end of two years, that his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness, and he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	21	20	Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years: and he departed without being desired; and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	22	1	And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead; for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	22	2	Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	22	3	He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab; for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	22	4	And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did the house of Ahab; for they were his counsellors after the death of his father, to his destruction.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	22	5	He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	22	6	And he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	22	7	Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went unto Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	22	8	And it came to pass, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, that he found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, ministering to Ahaziah, and slew them.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	22	9	And he sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (now he was hiding in Samaria), and they brought him to Jehu, and slew him; and they buried him, for they said, He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Jehovah with all his heart. And the house of Ahaziah had no	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	22	10	Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	22	11	But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the kings sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the p	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	22	12	And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	23	1	And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into cov	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	23	2	And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of fathers houses of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	23	3	And all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the kings son shall reign, as Jehovah hath spoken concerning the sons of David.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	23	4	This is the thing that ye shall do: a third part of you, that come in on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the thresholds;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	23	5	and a third part shall be at the kings house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	23	6	But let none come into the house of Jehovah, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall come in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the charge of Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	23	7	And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever cometh into the house, let him be slain: and be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	23	8	So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath; with those that were to go out on the sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the cour	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	23	9	And Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king Davids, which were in the house of God.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	23	10	And he set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	23	11	Then they brought out the kings son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony, and made him king: and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him; and they said, Long live the king.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	23	12	And when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of Jehovah:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	23	13	and she looked, and, behold, the king stood by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets; the singers also played on instruments of music, and led the singing of p	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	23	14	And Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth between the ranks; and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword: for the priest said, Slay her not in the house of Jeh	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	23	15	So they made way for her; and she went to the entrance of the horse gate to the kings house: and they slew her there.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	23	16	And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, and all the people, and the king, that they should be Jehovahs people.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	23	17	And all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	23	18	And Jehoiada appointed the officers of the house of Jehovah under the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of Jehovah, to offer the burnt-offerings of Jehovah, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and wi	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	23	19	And he set the porters at the gates of the house of Jehovah, that none that was unclean in anything should enter in.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	23	20	And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of Jehovah: and they came through the upper gate unto the kings house, and set the king upon th	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	23	21	So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. And Athaliah they had slain with the sword.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	1	Joash was seven years old when he began to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Zibiah, of Beer-sheba.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	2	And Joash did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah all the days of Jehoiada the priest.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	3	And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	4	And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to restore the house of Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	5	And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year; and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it n	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	6	And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tax of Moses the servant of Jehovah, and of the assembly of Israel, for the tent of the testimony?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	7	For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of Jehovah did they bestow upon the Baalim.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	8	So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	9	And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for Jehovah the tax that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	10	And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	11	And it was so, that, at what time the chest was brought unto the kings officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the kings scribe and the chief priests officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	12	And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of Jehovah; and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of Jehovah, and also such as wrought iron and brass to repair the house of Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	13	So the workmen wrought, and the work of repairing went forward in their hands, and they set up the house of God in its state, and strengthened it.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	14	And when they had made an end, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of Jehovah, even vessels wherewith to minister and to offer, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offer	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	15	But Jehoiada waxed old and was full of days, and he died; a hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	16	And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God and his house.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	17	Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	18	And they forsook the house of Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	19	Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto Jehovah; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	20	And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of Jehovah, so that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken Jehovah, he hat	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	21	And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	22	Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, Jehovah look upon it, and require it.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	23	And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the army of the Syrians came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	24	For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; and Jehovah delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers. So they executed judgment upon Joash.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	25	And when they were departed for him (for they left him very sick), his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died; and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	26	And these are they that conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	24	27	Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the rebuilding of the house of God, behold, they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	1	Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Jehoaddan, of Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	2	And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, but not with a perfect heart.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	3	Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established unto him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	4	But he put not their children to death, but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, as Jehovah commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers; but every man sha	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	5	Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and ordered them according to their fathers houses, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found them three hu	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	6	He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	7	But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for Jehovah is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	8	But if thou wilt go, do valiantly, be strong for the battle: God will cast thee down before the enemy; for God hath power to help, and to cast down.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	9	And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, Jehovah is able to give thee much more than this.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	10	Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	11	And Amaziah took courage, and led forth his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	12	And other ten thousand did the children of Judah carry away alive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were broken in pieces.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	13	But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smote of them three thousand, and took much spoil.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	14	Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	15	Wherefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, who said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of thy hand?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	16	And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Have we made thee of the kings counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	17	Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	18	And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thi	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	19	Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten Edom; and thy heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	20	But Amaziah would not hear; for it was of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought after the gods of Edom.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	21	So Joash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	22	And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	23	And Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	24	And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the kings house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	25	And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	26	Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	27	Now from the time that Amaziah did turn away from following Jehovah they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	25	28	And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	26	1	And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	26	2	He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	26	3	Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Jechiliah, of Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	26	4	And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	26	5	And he set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of God: and as long as he sought Jehovah, God made him to prosper.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	26	6	And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in the country of Ashdod, and among the Philistines.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	26	7	And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the Meunim.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	26	8	And the Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt; for he waxed exceeding strong.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	26	9	Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	26	10	And he built towers in the wilderness, and hewed out many cisterns, for he had much cattle; in the lowland also, and in the plain: and he had husbandmen and vinedressers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields; for he loved husbandry.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	26	11	Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their reckoning made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the kings captains.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	26	12	The whole number of the heads of fathers houses, even the mighty men of valor, was two thousand and six hundred.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	26	13	And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	26	14	And Uzziah prepared for them, even for all the host, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and stones for slinging.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	26	15	And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by skilful men, to be on the towers and upon the battlements, wherewith to shoot arrows and great stones. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	26	16	But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against Jehovah his God; for he went into the temple of Jehovah to burn incense upon the altar of incense.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	26	17	And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of Jehovah, that were valiant men:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	26	18	and they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It pertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto Jehovah, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neithe	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	26	19	Then Uzziah was wroth; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy brake forth in his forehead before the priests in the house of Jehovah, beside the altar of incense.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	26	20	And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out quickly from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because Jehovah had smitten him.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	26	21	And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of Jehovah: and Jotham his son was over the kings house, judging the people of the land.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	26	22	Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	26	23	So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	27	1	Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	27	2	And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Uzziah had done: howbeit he entered not into the temple of Jehovah. And the people did yet corruptly.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	27	3	He built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	27	4	Moreover he built cities in the hill-country of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	27	5	He fought also with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Am	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	27	6	So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before Jehovah his God.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	27	7	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	27	8	He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	27	9	And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	1	Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he did not that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, like David his father;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	2	but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for the Baalim.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	3	Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	4	And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	5	Wherefore Jehovah his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away of his a great multitude of captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote h	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	6	For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men; because they had forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	7	And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the kings son, and Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	8	And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	9	But a prophet of Jehovah was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out to meet the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because Jehovah, the God of your fathers, was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	10	And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not even with you trespasses of your own against Jehovah your God?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	11	Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives, that ye have taken captive of your brethren; for the fierce wrath of Jehovah is upon you.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	12	Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	13	and said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for ye purpose that which will bring upon us a trespass against Jehovah, to add unto our sins and to our trespass; for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	14	So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	15	And the men that have been mentioned by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of th	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	16	At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	17	For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	18	The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with the towns thereof, and Timnah with the towns thereof, Gimzo also and the towns thereof: and they dw	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	19	For Jehovah brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he had dealt wantonly in Judah, and trespassed sore against Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	20	And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	21	For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Jehovah, and out of the house of the king and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but it helped him not.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	22	And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against Jehovah, this same king Ahaz.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	23	For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him; and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	24	And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of Jehovah; and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	25	And in every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger Jehovah, the God of his fathers.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	26	Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	28	27	And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem; for they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	1	Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old; and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	2	And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	3	He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of Jehovah, and repaired them.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	4	And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the broad place on the east,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	5	and said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites; now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of Jehovah, the God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	6	For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Jehovah, and turned their backs.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	7	Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt-offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	8	Wherefore the wrath of Jehovah was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to be tossed to and fro, to be an astonishment, and a hissing, as ye see with your eyes.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	9	For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	10	Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Jehovah, the God of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn away from us.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	11	My sons, be not now negligent; for Jehovah hath chosen you to stand before him, to minister unto him, and that ye should be his ministers, and burn incense.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	12	Then the Levites arose, Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	13	and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	14	and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	15	And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the king by the words of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	16	And the priests went in unto the inner part of the house of Jehovah, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Jehovah into the court of the house of Jehovah. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad to the	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	17	Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of Jehovah; and they sanctified the house of Jehovah in eight days: and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	18	Then they went in to Hezekiah the king within the palace, and said, We have cleansed all the house of Jehovah, and the altar of burnt-offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the table of showbread, with all the vessels thereof.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	19	Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away when he trespassed, have we prepared and sanctified; and, behold, they are before the altar of Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	20	Then Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the house of Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	21	And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats, for a sin-offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	22	So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: and they killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	23	And they brought near the he-goats for the sin-offering before the king and the assembly; and they laid their hands upon them:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	24	and the priests killed them, and they made a sin-offering with their blood upon the altar, to make atonement for all Israel; for the king commanded that the burnt-offering and the sin-offering should be made for all Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	25	And he set the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the kings seer, and Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was of Jehovah by his prophets.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	26	And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	27	And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt-offering upon the altar. And when the burnt-offering began, the song of Jehovah began also, and the trumpets, together with the instruments of David king of Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	28	And all the assembly worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this continued until the burnt-offering was finished.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	29	And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	30	Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises unto Jehovah with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	31	Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto Jehovah; come near and bring sacrifices and thank-offerings into the house of Jehovah. And the assembly brought in sacrifices and thank-offerings; and as many as were of a willing he	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	32	And the number of the burnt-offerings which the assembly brought was threescore and ten bullocks, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt-offering to Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	33	And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	34	But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt-offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	35	And also the burnt-offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and with the drink-offerings for every burnt-offering. So the service of the house of Jehovah was set in order.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	29	36	And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which God had prepared for the people: for the thing was done suddenly.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	1	And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto Jehovah, the God of Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	2	For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	3	For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	4	And the thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	5	So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem: for they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as it is	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	6	So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may retu	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	7	And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, who trespassed against Jehovah, the God of their fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as ye see.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	8	Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were; but yield yourselves unto Jehovah, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever, and serve Jehovah your God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	9	For if ye turn again unto Jehovah, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that led them captive, and shall come again into this land: for Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	10	So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	11	Nevertheless certain men of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	12	Also upon Judah came the hand of God to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	13	And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	14	And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	15	Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt-offerings into the house of Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	16	And they stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	17	For there were many in the assembly that had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites had the charge of killing the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	18	For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, The good Jehovah pardon every one	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	19	that setteth his heart to seek God, Jehovah, the God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	20	And Jehovah hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	21	And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised Jehovah day by day, singing with loud instruments unto Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	22	And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that had good understanding in the service of Jehovah. So they did eat throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace-offerings, and making confession to Jehovah, the God of their	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	23	And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept other seven days with gladness.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	24	For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the assembly for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	25	And all the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	26	So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	30	27	Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even unto heaven.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	31	1	Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake in pieces the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim, and brake down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Man	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	31	2	And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt-offerings and for peace-offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	31	3	He appointed also the kings portion of his substance for the burnt-offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt-offerings, and the burnt-offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of Jeho	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	31	4	Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the law of Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	31	5	And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first-fruits of grain, new wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	31	6	And the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated unto Jehovah their God, and laid them by heaps.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	31	7	In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	31	8	And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed Jehovah, and his people Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	31	9	Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	31	10	And Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him and said, Since the people began to bring the oblations into the house of Jehovah, we have eaten and had enough, and have left plenty: for Jehovah hath blessed his people; and that which is	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	31	11	Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of Jehovah; and they prepared them.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	31	12	And they brought in the oblations and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: and over them Conaniah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was second.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	31	13	And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	31	14	And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter at the east gate, was over the freewill-offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of Jehovah, and the most holy things.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	31	15	And under him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	31	16	besides them that were reckoned by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even every one that entered into the house of Jehovah, as the duty of every day required, for their service in their offices according to their courses;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	31	17	and them that were reckoned by genealogy of the priests by their fathers houses, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their offices by their courses;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	31	18	and them that were reckoned by genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their office of trust they sanctified themselves in holiness.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	31	19	Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, that were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every city, there were men that were mentioned by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogy amon	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	31	20	And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah; and he wrought that which was good and right and faithful before Jehovah his God.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	31	21	And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	1	After these things, and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for himself.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	2	And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	3	he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city; and they helped him.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	4	So there was gathered much people together, and they stopped all the fountains, and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	5	And he took courage, and built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised it up to the towers, and the other wall without, and strengthened Millo in the city of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	6	And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	7	Be strong and of good courage, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him; for there is a greater with us than with him:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	8	with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is Jehovah our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	9	After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (now he was before Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	10	Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide the siege in Jerusalem?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	11	Doth not Hezekiah persuade you, to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	12	Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and upon it shall ye burn incense?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	13	Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands in any wise able to deliver their land out of my hand?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	14	Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	15	Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you after this manner, neither believe ye him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deli	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	16	And his servants spake yet more against Jehovah God, and against his servant Hezekiah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	17	He wrote also letters, to rail on Jehovah, the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of my ha	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	18	And they cried with a loud voice in the Jews language unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	19	And they spake of the God of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of mens hands.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	20	And Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	21	And Jehovah sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains, in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth f	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	22	Thus Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	23	And many brought gifts unto Jehovah to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah; so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	24	In those days Hezekiah was sick even unto death: and he prayed unto Jehovah; and he spake unto him, and gave him a sign.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	25	But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	26	Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Jehovah came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	27	And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor: and he provided him treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of goodly vessels;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	28	store-houses also for the increase of grain and new wine and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and flocks in folds.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	29	Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very much substance.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	30	This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	31	Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	32	Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	32	33	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, after the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	3	For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars for the Baalim, and made Asheroth, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	4	And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, whereof Jehovah said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	5	And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	6	He also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; and he practised augury, and used enchantments, and practised sorcery, and dealt with them that had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sigh	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	7	And he set the graven image of the idol, which he had made, in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	8	neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances given by Moses.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	9	And Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did evil more than did the nations whom Jehovah destroyed before the children of Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	10	And Jehovah spake to Manasseh, and to his people; but they gave no heed.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	11	Wherefore Jehovah brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in chains, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	12	And when he was in distress, he besought Jehovah his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	13	And he prayed unto him; and he was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah he was God.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	14	Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate; and he compassed Ophel about with it, and raised it up to a very great height: and he put valiant captains in all	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	15	And he took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house of Jehovah, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of Jehovah, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	16	And he built up the altar of Jehovah, and offered thereon sacrifices of peace-offerings and of thanksgiving, and commanded Judah to serve Jehovah, the God of Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	17	Nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places, but only unto Jehovah their God.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	18	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	19	His prayer also, and how God was entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up the Asherim and the graven images, before he humbled himself: behold, they are written in the history of Hozai.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	20	So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	21	Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	22	And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed unto all the graven images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	23	And he humbled not himself before Jehovah, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but this same Amon trespassed more and more.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	24	And his servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	33	25	But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	1	Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	2	And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in the ways of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	3	For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten ima	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	4	And they brake down the altars of the Baalim in his presence; and the sun-images that were on high above them he hewed down; and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it upon the	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	5	And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	6	And so did he in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, in their ruins round about.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	7	And he brake down the altars, and beat the Asherim and the graven images into powder, and hewed down all the sun-images throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	8	Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of Jehovah his God.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	9	And they came to Hilkiah the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	10	And they delivered it into the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of Jehovah; and the workmen that wrought in the house of Jehovah gave it to mend and repair the house;	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	11	even to the carpenters and to the builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	12	And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and others of the Levites, all that were skilful wit	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	13	Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and set forward all that did the work in every manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	14	And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of Jehovah given by Moses.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	15	And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	16	And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they are doing.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	17	And they have emptied out the money that was found in the house of Jehovah, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	18	And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read therein before the king.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	19	And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	20	And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the kings servant, saying,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	21	Go ye, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Jehovah, to do	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	22	So Hilkiah, and they whom the king had commanded, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter;) and they spake to her to that effect.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	23	And she said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Tell ye the man that sent you unto me,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	24	Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	25	Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out upon this place, and it shall not be quenched.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	26	But unto the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: As touching the words which thou hast heard,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	27	because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and hast humbled thyself before me, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have he	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	28	Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof. And they brought back word to the king.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	29	Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	30	And the king went up to the house of Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that w	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	31	And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were writ	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	32	And he caused all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	34	33	And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were found in Israel to serve, even to serve Jehovah their God. All his days they departed not from following Jehovah, the God o	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	1	And Josiah kept a passover unto Jehovah in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	2	And he set the priests in their offices, and encouraged them to the service of the house of Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	3	And he said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, that were holy unto Jehovah, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; there shall no more be a burden upon your shoulders: now serve Jehovah your God, and h	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	4	And prepare yourselves after your fathers houses by your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	5	And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers houses of your brethren the children of the people, and let there be for each a portion of a fathers house of the Levites.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	6	And kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brethren, to do according to the word of Jehovah by Moses.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	7	And Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all of them for the passover-offerings, unto all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the kings substance.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	8	And his princes gave for a freewill-offering unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover-offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	9	Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for the passover-offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	10	So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their courses, according to the kings commandment.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	11	And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of their hand, and the Levites flayed them.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	12	And they removed the burnt-offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers houses of the children of the people, to offer unto Jehovah, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	13	And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: and the holy offerings boiled they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	14	And afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering the burnt-offerings and the fat until night: therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaro	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	15	And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the kings seer; and the porters were at every gate: they needed not to depart from their service; for their brethren the Levit	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	16	So all the service of Jehovah was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt-offerings upon the altar of Jehovah, according to the commandment of king Josiah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	17	And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	18	And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the in	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	19	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	20	After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	21	But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war; and God hath commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is wit	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	22	Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	23	And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	24	So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	25	And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations unto this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	26	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the law of Jehovah,	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	35	27	and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	36	1	Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his fathers stead in Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	36	2	Joahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	36	3	And the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and fined the land a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	36	4	And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	36	5	Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah his God.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	36	6	Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	36	7	Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of Jehovah to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	36	8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	36	9	Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	36	10	And at the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of Jehovah, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	36	11	Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	36	12	and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah his God; he humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of Jehovah.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	36	13	And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart against turning unto Jehovah, the God of Israel.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	36	14	Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people, trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted the house of Jehovah which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	36	15	And Jehovah, the God of their fathers, sent to them by his messengers, rising up early and sending, because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling-place:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	36	16	but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the wrath of Jehovah arose against his people, till there was no remedy.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	36	17	Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldeans, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or virgin, old man or hoary-headed: he gave them all into his hand.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	36	18	And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes, all these he brought to Babylon.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	36	19	And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	36	20	And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	36	21	to fulfil the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths: for as long as it lay desolate it kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	36	22	Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in wr	14
ASV	2 Chronicles	36	23	Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath Jehovah, the God of heaven, given me; and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whosoever there is among you of all his people, Jehovah his God be with	14
ASV	Ezra	1	1	Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in wr	26
ASV	Ezra	1	2	Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath Jehovah, the God of heaven, given me; and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.	26
ASV	Ezra	1	3	Whosoever there is among you of all his people, his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of Jehovah, the God of Israel (he is God), which is in Jerusalem.	26
ASV	Ezra	1	4	And whosoever is left, in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, besides the freewill-offering for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.	26
ASV	Ezra	1	5	Then rose up the heads of fathers houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, even all whose spirit God had stirred to go up to build the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem.	26
ASV	Ezra	1	6	And all they that were round about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered.	26
ASV	Ezra	1	7	Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of Jehovah, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put in the house of his gods;	26
ASV	Ezra	1	8	even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.	26
ASV	Ezra	1	9	And this is the number of them: thirty platters of gold, a thousand platters of silver, nine and twenty knives,	26
ASV	Ezra	1	10	thirty bowls of gold, silver bowls of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.	26
ASV	Ezra	1	11	All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up, when they of the captivity were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.	26
ASV	Ezra	2	1	Now these are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon, and that returned unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one unto his city;	26
ASV	Ezra	2	2	who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:	26

ASV	Ezra	2	56	the children of Jaalah, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel,	26
ASV	Ezra	2	57	the children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the children of Ami.	26
ASV	Ezra	2	58	All the Nethinim, and the children of Solomons servants, were three hundred ninety and two.	26
ASV	Ezra	2	59	And these were they that went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer; but they could not show their fathers houses, and their seed, whether they were of Israel:	26
ASV	Ezra	2	60	the children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two.	26
ASV	Ezra	2	61	And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name.	26
ASV	Ezra	2	62	These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood.	26
ASV	Ezra	2	63	And the governor said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim.	26
ASV	Ezra	2	64	The whole assembly together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore,	26
ASV	Ezra	2	65	besides their men-servants and their maid-servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred singing men and singing women.	26
ASV	Ezra	2	66	Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five;	26
ASV	Ezra	2	67	their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.	26
ASV	Ezra	2	68	And some of the heads of fathers houses, when they came to the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem, offered willingly for the house of God to set it up in its place:	26
ASV	Ezra	2	69	they gave after their ability into the treasury of the work threescore and one thousand darics of gold, and five thousand pounds of silver, and one hundred priests garments.	26
ASV	Ezra	2	70	So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinim, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.	26
ASV	Ezra	3	1	And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.	26
ASV	Ezra	3	2	Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God	26
ASV	Ezra	3	3	And they set the altar upon its base; for fear was upon them because of the peoples of the countries: and they offered burnt-offerings thereon unto Jehovah, even burnt-offerings morning and evening.	26
ASV	Ezra	3	4	And they kept the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required;	26
ASV	Ezra	3	5	and afterward the continual burnt-offering, and the offerings of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of Jehovah that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill-offering unto Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezra	3	6	From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah: but the foundation of the temple of Jehovah was not yet laid.	26
ASV	Ezra	3	7	They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and food, and drink, and oil, unto them of Sidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar-trees from Lebanon to the sea, unto Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.	26
ASV	Ezra	3	8	Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come o	26
ASV	Ezra	3	9	Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to have the oversight of the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites.	26
ASV	Ezra	3	10	And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise Jehovah, after the order of David king of Israel.	26
ASV	Ezra	3	11	And they sang one to another in praising and giving thanks unto Jehovah, saying, For he is good, for his lovingkindness endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised Jehovah, because the foundation of th	26
ASV	Ezra	3	12	But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers houses, the old men that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:	26
ASV	Ezra	3	13	so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.	26
ASV	Ezra	4	1	Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple unto Jehovah, the God of Israel;	26
ASV	Ezra	4	2	then they drew near to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of fathers houses, and said unto them, Let us build with you; for we seek your God, as ye do; and we sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assyria, who brought us up hither.	26
ASV	Ezra	4	3	But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers houses of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us in building a house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king	26
ASV	Ezra	4	4	Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,	26
ASV	Ezra	4	5	and hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.	26
ASV	Ezra	4	6	And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.	26
ASV	Ezra	4	7	And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian character, and set forth in the Syrian tongue.	26
ASV	Ezra	4	8	Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:	26
ASV	Ezra	4	9	then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions, the Dinaites, and the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehaites, the Elamites,	26
ASV	Ezra	4	10	and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over, and set in the city of Samaria, and in the rest of the country beyond the River, and so forth.	26
ASV	Ezra	4	11	This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto Artaxerxes the king: Thy servants the men beyond the River, and so forth.	26
ASV	Ezra	4	12	Be it known unto the king, that the Jews that came up from thee are come to us unto Jerusalem; they are building the rebellious and the bad city, and have finished the walls, and repaired the foundations.	26
ASV	Ezra	4	13	Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and in the end it will be hurtful unto the kings.	26
ASV	Ezra	4	14	Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not meet for us to see the kings dishonor, therefore have we sent and certified the king;	26
ASV	Ezra	4	15	that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old	26
ASV	Ezra	4	16	We certify the king that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, by this means thou shalt have no portion beyond the River.	26
ASV	Ezra	4	17	Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and in the rest of the country beyond the River: Peace, and so forth.	26
ASV	Ezra	4	18	The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.	26
ASV	Ezra	4	19	And I decreed, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.	26
ASV	Ezra	4	20	There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all the country beyond the River; and tribute, custom, and toll, was paid unto them.	26
ASV	Ezra	4	21	Make ye now a decree to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until a decree shall be made by me.	26
ASV	Ezra	4	22	And take heed that ye be not slack herein: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?	26
ASV	Ezra	4	23	Then when the copy of king Artaxerxes letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.	26
ASV	Ezra	4	24	Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.	26
ASV	Ezra	5	1	Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem; in the name of the God of Israel prophesied they unto them.	26
ASV	Ezra	5	2	Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them.	26
ASV	Ezra	5	3	At the same time came to them Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?	26
ASV	Ezra	5	4	Then we told them after this manner, what the names of the men were that were making this building.	26
ASV	Ezra	5	5	But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not make them cease, till the matter should come to Darius, and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it.	26
ASV	Ezra	5	6	The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and his companions the Apharsachites, who were beyond the River, sent unto Darius the king;	26
ASV	Ezra	5	7	they sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus: Unto Darius the king, all peace.	26
ASV	Ezra	5	8	Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls; and this work goeth on with diligence and prospereth in their hands.	26
ASV	Ezra	5	9	Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?	26
ASV	Ezra	5	10	We asked them their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were at the head of them.	26
ASV	Ezra	5	11	And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and are building the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and finished.	26
ASV	Ezra	5	12	But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.	26
ASV	Ezra	5	13	But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God.	26
ASV	Ezra	5	14	And the gold and silver vessels also of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto o	26
ASV	Ezra	5	15	and he said unto him, Take these vessels, go, put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in its place.	26
ASV	Ezra	5	16	Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundations of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not completed.	26
ASV	Ezra	5	17	Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the kings treasure-house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send his plea	26
ASV	Ezra	6	1	Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the archives, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.	26
ASV	Ezra	6	2	And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of Media, a roll, and therein was thus written for a record:	26
ASV	Ezra	6	3	In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king made a decree: Concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, let the house be builded, the place where they offer sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore c	26
ASV	Ezra	6	4	with three courses of great stones, and a course of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the kings house.	26
ASV	Ezra	6	5	And also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to its place;	26
ASV	Ezra	6	6	Now therefore, Tattenai, governor beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who are beyond the River, be ye far from thence:	26
ASV	Ezra	6	7	let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place.	26
ASV	Ezra	6	8	Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to these elders of the Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the kings goods, even of the tribute beyond the River, expenses be given with all diligence unto these men, that they be not hindered.	26
ASV	Ezra	6	9	And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for burnt-offerings to the God of heaven; also wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests that are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail	26
ASV	Ezra	6	10	that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savor unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.	26
ASV	Ezra	6	11	Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let a beam be pulled out from his house, and let him be lifted up and fastened thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this:	26
ASV	Ezra	6	12	and the God that hath caused his name to dwell there overthrow all kings and peoples that shall put forth their hand to alter the same, to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with all diligence.	26
ASV	Ezra	6	13	Then Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, because that Darius the king had sent, did accordingly with all diligence.	26
ASV	Ezra	6	14	And the elders of the Jews builded and prospered, through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the decree of Cyrus, and D	26
ASV	Ezra	6	15	And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.	26
ASV	Ezra	6	16	And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy.	26
ASV	Ezra	6	17	And they offered at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.	26
ASV	Ezra	6	18	And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.	26
ASV	Ezra	6	19	And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month.	26
ASV	Ezra	6	20	For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were pure: and they killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.	26
ASV	Ezra	6	21	And the children of Israel that were come again out of the captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, did eat,	26
ASV	Ezra	6	22	and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for Jehovah had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.	26
ASV	Ezra	7	1	Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,	26
ASV	Ezra	7	2	the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,	26
ASV	Ezra	7	3	the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,	26
ASV	Ezra	7	4	the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,	26
ASV	Ezra	7	5	the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest;	26
ASV	Ezra	7	6	this Ezra went up from Babylon: and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which Jehovah, the God of Israel, had given; and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of Jehovah his God upon him.	26
ASV	Ezra	7	7	And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinim, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.	26
ASV	Ezra	7	8	And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.	26
ASV	Ezra	7	9	For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon; and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.	26
ASV	Ezra	7	10	For Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of Jehovah, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances.	26
ASV	Ezra	7	11	Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even the scribe of the words of the commandments of Jehovah, and of his statutes to Israel:	26
ASV	Ezra	7	12	Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect and so forth.	26
ASV	Ezra	7	13	I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and their priests and the Levites, in my realm, that are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem, go with thee.	26
ASV	Ezra	7	14	Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king and his seven counsellors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thy hand,	26
ASV	Ezra	7	15	and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,	26
ASV	Ezra	7	16	and all the silver and gold that thou shalt find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill-offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem;	26
ASV	Ezra	7	17	therefore thou shalt with all diligence buy with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meal-offerings and their drink-offerings, and shalt offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.	26
ASV	Ezra	7	18	And whatsoever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do ye after the will of your God.	26
ASV	Ezra	7	19	And the vessels that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem.	26
ASV	Ezra	7	20	And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the kings treasure-house.	26
ASV	Ezra	7	21	And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers that are beyond the River, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done with all diligence,	26
ASV	Ezra	7	22	unto a hundred talents of silver, and to a hundred measures of wheat, and to a hundred baths of wine, and to a hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.	26
ASV	Ezra	7	23	Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?	26
ASV	Ezra	7	24	Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, the singers, porters, Nethinim, or servants of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, custom, or toll, upon them.	26
ASV	Ezra	7	25	And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God that is in thy hand, appoint magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people that are beyond the River, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye him that knoweth them not.	26
ASV	Ezra	7	26	And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed upon him with all diligence, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.	26
ASV	Ezra	7	27	Blessed be Jehovah, the God of our fathers, who hath put such a thing as this in the kings heart, to beautify the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem;	26
ASV	Ezra	7	28	and hath extended lovingkindness unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the kings mighty princes. And I was strengthened according to the hand of Jehovah my God upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with m	26
ASV	Ezra	8	1	Now these are the heads of their fathers houses, and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king:	26
ASV	Ezra	8	2	Of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom. Of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel. Of the sons of David, Hattush.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	3	Of the sons of Shecaniah, of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah; and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males a hundred and fifty.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	4	Of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah; and with him two hundred males.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	5	Of the sons of Shecaniah, the son of Jahaziel; and with him three hundred males.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	6	And of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan; and with him fifty males.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	7	And of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah; and with him seventy males.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	8	And of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael; and with him fourscore males.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	9	Of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel; and with him two hundred and eighteen males.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	10	And of the sons of Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah; and with him a hundred and threescore males.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	11	And of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai; and with him twenty and eight males.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	12	And of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan; and with him a hundred and ten males.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	13	And of the sons of Adonikam, that were the last; and these are their names: Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah; and with them threescore males.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	14	And of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud; and with them seventy males.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	15	And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there we encamped three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	16	Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, who were teachers.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	17	And I sent them forth unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia; and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and his brethren the Nethinim, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	18	And according to the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;	26
ASV	Ezra	8	19	and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;	26
ASV	Ezra	8	20	and of the Nethinim, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim: all of them were mentioned by name.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	21	Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of him a straight way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	22	For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way, because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them that seek him, for good; but his power and his wrath is against	26
ASV	Ezra	8	23	So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was entreated of us.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	24	Then I set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,	26
ASV	Ezra	8	25	and weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering for the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his princes, and all Israel there present, had offered:	26
ASV	Ezra	8	26	I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels a hundred talents; of gold a hundred talents;	26
ASV	Ezra	8	27	and twenty bowls of gold, of a thousand darics; and two vessels of fine bright brass, precious as gold.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	28	And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto Jehovah, and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill-offering unto Jehovah, the God of your fathers.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	29	Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the princes of the fathers houses of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	30	So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	31	Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the lier-in-wait by the way.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	32	And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	33	And on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadia	26
ASV	Ezra	8	34	the whole by number and by weight: and all the weight was written at that time.	26
ASV	Ezra	8	35	The children of the captivity, that were come out of exile, offered burnt-offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin-offering: all this was a burnt-offering unt	26
ASV	Ezra	8	36	And they delivered the kings commissions unto the kings satraps, and to the governors beyond the River: and they furthered the people and the house of God.	26
ASV	Ezra	9	1	Now when these things were done, the princes drew near unto me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the	26
ASV	Ezra	9	2	For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the peoples of the lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.	26
ASV	Ezra	9	3	And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my robe, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down confounded.	26
ASV	Ezra	9	4	Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the trespass of them of the captivity; and I sat confounded until the evening oblation.	26
ASV	Ezra	9	5	And at the evening oblation I arose up from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe rent; and I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto Jehovah my God;	26
ASV	Ezra	9	6	and I said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God; for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our guiltiness is grown up unto the heavens.	26
ASV	Ezra	9	7	Since the days of our fathers we have been exceeding guilty unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder, and to confusion of	26
ASV	Ezra	9	8	And now for a little moment grace hath been showed from Jehovah our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.	26
ASV	Ezra	9	9	For we are bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended lovingkindness unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the ruins thereof, and to give us a wal	26
ASV	Ezra	9	10	And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,	26
ASV	Ezra	9	11	which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with	26
ASV	Ezra	9	12	now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity for ever; that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children fo	26
ASV	Ezra	9	13	And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such a remnant,	26
ASV	Ezra	9	14	shall we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the peoples that do these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape?	26
ASV	Ezra	9	15	O Jehovah, the God of Israel, thou art righteous; for we are left a remnant that is escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our guiltiness; for none can stand before thee because of this.	26
ASV	Ezra	10	1	Now while Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there was gathered together unto him out of Israel a very great assembly of men and women and children; for the people wept very sore.	26
ASV	Ezra	10	2	And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land: yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing.	26
ASV	Ezra	10	3	Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.	26
ASV	Ezra	10	4	Arise; for the matter belongeth unto thee, and we are with thee: be of good courage, and do it.	26
ASV	Ezra	10	5	Then arose Ezra, and made the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. So they sware.	26
ASV	Ezra	10	6	Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water; for he mourned because of the trespass of them of the captivity.	26
ASV	Ezra	10	7	And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;	26
ASV	Ezra	10	8	and that whosoever came not within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the assembly of the captivity.	26
ASV	Ezra	10	9	Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within the three days; it was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month: and all the people sat in the broad place before the house of God, trembling because of th	26
ASV	Ezra	10	10	And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have trespassed, and have married foreign women, to increase the guilt of Israel.	26
ASV	Ezra	10	11	Now therefore make confession unto Jehovah, the God of your fathers, and do his pleasure; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign women.	26
ASV	Ezra	10	12	Then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said concerning us, so must we do.	26
ASV	Ezra	10	13	But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without: neither is this a work of one day or two; for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.	26
ASV	Ezra	10	14	Let now our princes be appointed for all the assembly, and let all them that are in our cities that have married foreign women come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God be tu	26
ASV	Ezra	10	15	Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.	26
ASV	Ezra	10	16	And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain heads of fathers houses, after their fathers houses, and all of them by their names, were set apart; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.	26
ASV	Ezra	10	17	And they made an end with all the men that had married foreign women by the first day of the first month.	26
ASV	Ezra	10	18	And among the sons of the priests there were found that had married foreign women: namely, of the sons of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brethren, Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.	26
ASV	Ezra	10	19	And they gave their hand that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their guilt.	26
ASV	Ezra	10	20	And of the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah.	26

ASV	Nehemiah	1	1	The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	1	2	that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, that were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	1	3	And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	1	4	And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	1	5	and said, I beseech thee, O Jehovah, the God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments:	16
ASV	Nehemiah	1	6	Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants while I confess the sins of the children of Israel,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	1	7	we have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	1	8	Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye trespass, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples:	16
ASV	Nehemiah	1	9	but if ye return unto me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	1	10	Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	1	11	O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who delight to fear thy name; and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. Now I was c	16
ASV	Nehemiah	2	1	And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, that I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	2	2	And the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	2	3	And I said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?	16
ASV	Nehemiah	2	4	Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	2	5	And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favor in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers sepulchres, that I may build it.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	2	6	And the king said unto me (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	2	7	Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through till I come unto Judah;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	2	8	and a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the kings forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the castle which appertaineth to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	2	9	Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the kings letters. Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	2	10	And when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, for that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	2	11	So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	2	12	And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem; neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	2	13	And I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the jackals well, and to the dung gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	2	14	Then I went on to the fountain gate and to the kings pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	2	15	Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	2	16	And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	2	17	Then said I unto them, Ye see the evil case that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	2	18	And I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me, as also of the kings words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for the good work.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	2	19	But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?	16
ASV	Nehemiah	2	20	Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	1	Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananel.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	2	And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	3	And the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	4	And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel. And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	5	And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their lord.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	6	And the old gate repaired Joiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	7	And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, that appertained to the throne of the governor beyond the River.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	8	Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, goldsmiths. And next unto him repaired Hananiah one of the perfumers, and they fortified Jerusalem even unto the broad wall.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	9	And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	10	And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, over against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabneiah.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	11	Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hasshub the son of Pahath-moab, repaired another portion, and the tower of the furnaces.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	12	And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Hallohesh, the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	13	The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits of the wall unto the dung gate.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	14	And the dung gate repaired Malchijah the son of Rechab, the ruler of the district of Beth-haccherem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	15	And the fountain gate repaired Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of the district of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Shelah by the kings garden, ev	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	16	After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of half the district of Beth-zur, unto the place over against the sepulchres of David, and unto the pool that was made, and unto the house of the mighty men.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	17	After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next unto him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of half the district of Keilah, for his district.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	18	After him repaired their brethren, Bavvai the son of Henadad, the ruler of half the district of Keilah.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	19	And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another portion, over against the ascent to the armory at the turning of the wall.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	20	After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired another portion, from the turning of the wall unto the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	21	After him repaired Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz another portion, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	22	And after him repaired the priests, the men of the Plain.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	23	After them repaired Benjamin and Hasshub over against their house. After them repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah beside his own house.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	24	After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another portion, from the house of Azariah unto the turning of the wall, and unto the corner.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	25	Palal the son of Uzai repaired over against the turning of the wall, and the tower that standeth out from the upper house of the king, which is by the court of the guard. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh repaired.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	26	(Now the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that standeth out.)	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	27	After him the Tekoites repaired another portion, over against the great tower that standeth out, and unto the wall of Ophel.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	28	Above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over against his own house.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	29	After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his own house. And after him repaired Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the east gate.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	30	After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, another portion. After him repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah over against his chamber.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	31	After him repaired Malchijah one of the goldsmiths unto the house of the Nethinim, and of the merchants, over against the gate of Hammiphkad, and to the ascent of the corner.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	3	32	And between the ascent of the corner and the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	4	1	But it came to pass that, when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	4	2	And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, seeing they a	16
ASV	Nehemiah	4	3	Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they are building, if a fox go up, he shall break down their stone wall.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	4	4	Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn back their reproach upon their own head, and give them up for a spoil in a land of captivity;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	4	5	and cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee; for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	4	6	So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto half the height thereof: for the people had a mind to work.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	4	7	But it came to pass that, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	4	8	and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion therein.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	4	9	But we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	4	10	And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	4	11	And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come into the midst of them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	4	12	And it came to pass that, when the Jews that dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times from all places, Ye must return unto us.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	4	13	Therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I set there the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	4	14	And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your	16
ASV	Nehemiah	4	15	And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	4	16	And it came to pass from that time forth, that half of my servants wrought in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	4	17	They all builded the wall and they that bare burdens laded themselves; every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other held his weapon;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	4	18	and the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	4	19	And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another:	16
ASV	Nehemiah	4	20	in what place soever ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us; our God will fight for us.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	4	21	So we wrought in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	4	22	Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	4	23	So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard that followed me, none of us put off our clothes, every one went with his weapon to the water.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	5	1	Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	5	2	For there were that said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many: let us get grain, that we may eat and live.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	5	3	Some also there were that said, We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses: let us get grain, because of the dearth.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	5	4	There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the kings tribute upon our fields and our vineyards.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	5	5	Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage already: neither is it in our power to help it;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	5	6	And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	5	7	Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I held a great assembly against them.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	5	8	And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, that were sold unto the nations; and would ye even sell your brethren, and should they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found never a word.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	5	9	Also I said, The thing that ye do is not good: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?	16
ASV	Nehemiah	5	10	And I likewise, my brethren and my servants, do lend them money and grain. I pray you, let us leave off this usury.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	5	11	Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	5	12	Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	5	13	Also I shook out my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performeth not this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the assembly said, Amen, and praised Jehovah. And the people did according	16
ASV	Nehemiah	5	14	Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	5	15	But the former governors that were before me were chargeable unto the people, and took of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	5	16	Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	5	17	Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, a hundred and fifty men, besides those that came unto us from among the nations that were round about us.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	5	18	Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this p	16
ASV	Nehemiah	5	19	Remember unto me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	6	1	Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and unto the rest of our enemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though even unto that time I had not set up the doors	16
ASV	Nehemiah	6	2	that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	6	3	And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?	16
ASV	Nehemiah	6	4	And they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	6	5	Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	6	6	wherein was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou art building the wall: and thou wouldest be their king, according to these words.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	6	7	And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	6	8	Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	6	9	For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. But now, O God, strengthen thou my hands.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	6	10	And I went unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the	16
ASV	Nehemiah	6	11	And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	6	12	And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	6	13	For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	6	14	Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	6	15	So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	6	16	And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard thereof, that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	6	17	Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	6	18	For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	6	19	Also they spake of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	7	1	Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	7	2	that I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the castle, charge over Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	7	3	And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand on guard, let them shut the doors, and bar ye them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be	16
ASV	Nehemiah	7	4	Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	7	5	And my God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of them that came up at the first, and I found written therein:	16
ASV	Nehemiah	7	6	These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and that returned unto Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	7	7	who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:	16
ASV	Nehemiah	7	8	The children of Parosh, two thousand a hundred and seventy and two.	16

ASV	Nehemiah	7	61	And these were they that went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer; but they could not show their fathers houses, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel:	16
ASV	Nehemiah	7	62	The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	7	63	And of the priests: the children of Hobaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	7	64	These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	7	65	And the governor said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	7	66	The whole assembly together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	7	67	besides their men-servants and their maid-servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women.	16

ASV	Nehemiah	7	70	And some from among the heads of fathers houses gave unto the work. The governor gave to the treasury a thousand darics of gold, fifty basins, five hundred and thirty priests garments.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	7	71	And some of the heads of fathers houses gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pounds of silver.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	7	72	And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand pounds of silver, and threescore and seven priests garments.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	7	73	So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinim, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities. And when the seventh month was come, the children of Israel were in their cities.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	8	1	And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the broad place that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Jehovah had commanded to Israel.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	8	2	And Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly, both men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	8	3	And he read therein before the broad place that was before the water gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women, and of those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law	16
ASV	Nehemiah	8	4	And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Uriah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchija	16
ASV	Nehemiah	8	5	And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:	16
ASV	Nehemiah	8	6	and Ezra blessed Jehovah, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with the lifting up of their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped Jehovah with their faces to the ground.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	8	7	Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in their place.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	8	8	And they read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that they understood the reading.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	8	9	And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto Jehovah your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the la	16
ASV	Nehemiah	8	10	Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto him for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye grieved; for the joy of Jehovah is your strength.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	8	11	So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	8	12	And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	8	13	And on the second day were gathered together the heads of fathers houses of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to give attention to the words of the law.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	8	14	And they found written in the law, how that Jehovah had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	8	15	and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and branches of wild olive, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as	16
ASV	Nehemiah	8	16	So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the broad place of the water gate, and in the broad place of the gate of Ephra	16
ASV	Nehemiah	8	17	And all the assembly of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and dwelt in the booths; for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	8	18	Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the ordinance.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	1	Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackcloth, and earth upon them.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	2	And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	3	And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of Jehovah their God a fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped Jehovah their God.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	4	Then stood up upon the stairs of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto Jehovah their God.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	5	Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless Jehovah your God from everlasting to everlasting; and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and pra	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	6	Thou art Jehovah, even thou alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things that are thereon, the seas and all that is in them, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	7	Thou art Jehovah the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	8	and foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give it unto his seed, and hast performed thy words; for t	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	9	And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red Sea,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	10	and showedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land; for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them, and didst get thee a name, as it is this day.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	11	And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their pursuers thou didst cast into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	12	Moreover in a pillar of cloud thou leddest them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	13	Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	14	and madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by Moses thy servant,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	15	and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and commandedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	16	But they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their neck, and hearkened not to thy commandments,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	17	and refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them, but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	18	Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	19	yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud departed not from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	20	Thou gavest also thy good Spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	21	Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, and they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	22	Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and peoples, which thou didst allot after their portions: so they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	23	Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land concerning which thou didst say to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	24	So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	25	And they took fortified cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns hewn out, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit-trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy gre	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	26	Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their back, and slew thy prophets that testified against them to turn them again unto thee, and they wrought great provocations.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	27	Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours who saved them	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	28	But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee; therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest from heaven; and many times didst thou	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	29	and testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law. Yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thine ordinances, (which if a man do, he shall live in them,) and withdrew the shoulder, an	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	30	Yet many years didst thou bear with them, and testifiedst against them by thy Spirit through thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	31	Nevertheless in thy manifold mercies thou didst not make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	32	Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and lovingkindness, let not all the travail seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, a	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	33	Howbeit thou art just in all that is come upon us; for thou hast dealt truly, but we have done wickedly;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	34	neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies wherewith thou didst testify against them.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	35	For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	36	Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	37	And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have power over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	9	38	And yet for all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, our Levites, and our priests, seal unto it.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	10	1	Now those that sealed were: Nehemiah the governor, the son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah,	16

ASV	Nehemiah	10	29	They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in Gods law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of Jehovah our Lord, and his ordinances and his statutes;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	10	30	and that we would not give our daughters unto the peoples of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	10	31	and if the peoples of the land bring wares or any grain on the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy of them on the sabbath, or on a holy day; and that we would forego the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	10	32	Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	10	33	for the showbread, and for the continual meal-offering, and for the continual burnt-offering, for the sabbaths, for the new moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin-offerings to make atonement for Israel, and for all the work of	16

ASV	Nehemiah	10	36	also the first-born of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is written in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the house of our God, unto the priests that minister in the house of our God;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	10	37	and that we should bring the first-fruits of our dough, and our heave-offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, the new wine and the oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites; for	16

ASV	Nehemiah	10	39	For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the heave-offering of the grain, of the new wine, and of the oil, unto the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers: a	16
ASV	Nehemiah	11	1	And the princes of the people dwelt in Jerusalem: the rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts in the other cities.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	11	2	And the people blessed all the men that willingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	11	3	Now these are the chiefs of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem: but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their cities, to wit, Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinim, and the children of Solomons servants.	16

ASV	Nehemiah	11	17	and Mattaniah the son of Mica, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, who was the chief to begin the thanksgiving in prayer, and Bakbukiah, the second among his brethren; and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	11	18	All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore and four.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	11	19	Moreover the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren, that kept watch at the gates, were a hundred seventy and two.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	11	20	And the residue of Israel, of the priests, the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	11	21	But the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel: and Ziha and Gishpa were over the Nethinim.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	11	22	The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica, of the sons of Asaph, the singers, over the business of the house of God.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	11	23	For there was a commandment from the king concerning them, and a settled provision for the singers, as every day required.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	11	24	And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the kings hand in all matters concerning the people.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	11	25	And as for the villages, with their fields, some of the children of Judah dwelt in Kiriath-arba and the towns thereof, and in Dibon and the towns thereof, and in Jekabzeel and the villages thereof,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	11	26	and in Jeshua, and in Moladah, and Beth-pelet,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	11	27	and in Hazar-shual, and in Beer-sheba and the towns thereof,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	11	28	and in Ziklag, and in Meconah and in the towns thereof,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	11	29	and in En-rimmon, and in Zorah, and in Jarmuth,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	11	30	Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages, Lachish and the fields thereof, Azekah and the towns thereof. So they encamped from Beer-sheba unto the valley of Hinnom.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	11	31	The children of Benjamin also dwelt from Geba onward, at Michmash and Aija, and at Beth-el and the towns thereof,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	11	32	at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	11	33	Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	11	34	Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	11	35	Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	11	36	And of the Levites, certain courses in Judah were joined to Benjamin.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	1	Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	2	Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	3	Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	4	Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	5	Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	6	Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	7	Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the chiefs of the priests and of their brethren in the days of Jeshua.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	8	Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who was over the thanksgiving, he and his brethren.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	9	Also Bakbukiah and Unno, their brethren, were over against them according to their offices.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	10	And Jeshua begat Joiakim, and Joiakim begat Eliashib, and Eliashib begat Joiada,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	11	and Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	12	And in the days of Joiakim were priests, heads of fathers houses: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	13	of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	14	of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	15	of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	16	of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	17	of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	18	of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	19	and of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	20	of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	21	of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	22	As for the Levites, in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, there were recorded the heads of fathers houses; also the priests, in the reign of Darius the Persian.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	23	The sons of Levi, heads of fathers houses, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	24	And the chiefs of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, watch next to watch.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	25	Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the watch at the store-houses of the gates.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	26	These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest the scribe.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	27	And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	28	And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	29	also from Beth-gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	30	And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	31	Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies that gave thanks and went in procession; whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate:	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	32	and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	33	and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	34	Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	35	and certain of the priests sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	36	and his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before them.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	37	And by the fountain gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	38	And the other company of them that gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the people, upon the wall, above the tower of the furnaces, even unto the broad wall,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	39	and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the gate of the guard.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	40	So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	41	and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	42	and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	43	And they offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	44	And on that day were men appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the heave-offerings, for the first-fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Le	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	45	And they kept the charge of their God, and the charge of the purification, and so did the singers and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	46	For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	12	47	And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, as every day required: and they set apart that which was for the Levites; and the Levites set apart that which was for the sons of Aar	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	1	On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God for ever,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	2	because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	3	And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	4	Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being allied unto Tobiah,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	5	had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meal-offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	6	But in all this time I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went unto the king: and after certain days asked I leave of the king,	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	7	and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	8	And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	9	Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meal-offerings and the frankincense.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	10	And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	11	Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	12	Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	13	And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to distribute un	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	14	Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the observances thereof.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	15	In those days saw I in Judah some men treading wine-presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses therewith; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testifi	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	16	There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	17	Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	18	Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	19	And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I over the gates, that t	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	20	So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	21	Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	22	And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember unto me, O my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy lovingkindness.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	23	In those days also saw I the Jews that had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	24	and their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews language, but according to the language of each people.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	25	And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	26	Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	27	Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	28	And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	29	Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	30	Thus cleansed I them from all foreigners, and appointed charges for the priests and for the Levites, every one in his work;	16
ASV	Nehemiah	13	31	and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.	16
ASV	Esther	1	1	Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even unto Ethiopia, over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces),	17
ASV	Esther	1	2	that in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,	17
ASV	Esther	1	3	in the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him;	17
ASV	Esther	1	4	when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even a hundred and fourscore days.	17
ASV	Esther	1	5	And when these days were fulfilled, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the kings palace.	17
ASV	Esther	1	6	There were hangings of white cloth, of green, and of blue, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the couches were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and white, and yellow, and black marble.	17
ASV	Esther	1	7	And they gave them drink in vessels of gold (the vessels being diverse one from another), and royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king.	17
ASV	Esther	1	8	And the drinking was according to the law; none could compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every mans pleasure.	17
ASV	Esther	1	9	Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.	17
ASV	Esther	1	10	On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that ministered in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,	17
ASV	Esther	1	11	to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the peoples and the princes her beauty; for she was fair to look on.	17
ASV	Esther	1	12	But the queen Vashti refused to come at the kings commandment by the chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.	17
ASV	Esther	1	13	Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times, (for so was the kings manner toward all that knew law and judgment;	17
ASV	Esther	1	14	and the next unto him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the kings face, and sat first in the kingdom),	17
ASV	Esther	1	15	What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not done the bidding of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?	17
ASV	Esther	1	16	And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the peoples that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.	17
ASV	Esther	1	17	For this deed of the queen will come abroad unto all women, to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.	17
ASV	Esther	1	18	And this day will the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the deed of the queen say the like unto all the kings princes. So will there arise much contempt and wrath.	17
ASV	Esther	1	19	If it please the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, that Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto	17
ASV	Esther	1	20	And when the kings decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give to their husbands honor, both to great and small.	17
ASV	Esther	1	21	And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:	17
ASV	Esther	1	22	for he sent letters into all the kings provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and should speak according to the language of his people.	17
ASV	Esther	2	1	After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.	17
ASV	Esther	2	2	Then said the kings servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:	17
ASV	Esther	2	3	and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hegai the kings chamberlain, keeper of the women; and l	17
ASV	Esther	2	4	and let the maiden that pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.	17
ASV	Esther	2	5	There was a certain Jew in Shushan the palace, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,	17
ASV	Esther	2	6	who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives that had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.	17
ASV	Esther	2	7	And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncles daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.	17
ASV	Esther	2	8	So it came to pass, when the kings commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the kings house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the wome	17
ASV	Esther	2	9	And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with her portions, and the seven maidens who were meet to be given her out of the kings house: and he removed her and her maidens to the be	17
ASV	Esther	2	10	Esther had not made known her people nor her kindred; for Mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known.	17
ASV	Esther	2	11	And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the womens house, to know how Esther did, and what would become of her.	17
ASV	Esther	2	12	Now when the turn of every maiden was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that it had been done to her according to the law for the women twelve months (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and	17
ASV	Esther	2	13	then in this wise came the maiden unto the king: whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the kings house.	17
ASV	Esther	2	14	In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the kings chamberlain, who kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and she were call	17
ASV	Esther	2	15	Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the kings chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obta	17
ASV	Esther	2	16	So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.	17
ASV	Esther	2	17	And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.	17
ASV	Esther	2	18	Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esthers feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the bounty of the king.	17
ASV	Esther	2	19	And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai was sitting in the kings gate.	17
ASV	Esther	2	20	Esther had not yet made known her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.	17
ASV	Esther	2	21	In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the kings gate, two of the kings chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those that kept the threshold, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.	17
ASV	Esther	2	22	And the thing became known to Mordecai, who showed it unto Esther the queen; and Esther told the king thereof in Mordecais name.	17
ASV	Esther	2	23	And when inquisition was made of the matter, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.	17
ASV	Esther	3	1	After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.	17
ASV	Esther	3	2	And all the kings servants, that were in the kings gate, bowed down, and did reverence to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence.	17
ASV	Esther	3	3	Then the kings servants, that were in the kings gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the kings commandment?	17
ASV	Esther	3	4	Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecais matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.	17
ASV	Esther	3	5	And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.	17
ASV	Esther	3	6	But he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.	17
ASV	Esther	3	7	In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.	17
ASV	Esther	3	8	And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from those of every people; neither keep they the kings laws: therefore it is no	17
ASV	Esther	3	9	If it please the king, let it be written that they be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those that have the charge of the kings business, to bring it into the kings treasuries.	17
ASV	Esther	3	10	And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews enemy.	17
ASV	Esther	3	11	And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.	17
ASV	Esther	3	12	Then were the kings scribes called in the first month, on the thirteenth day thereof; and there was written according to all that Haman commanded unto the kings satraps, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the princes of every peopl	17
ASV	Esther	3	13	And letters were sent by posts into all the kings provinces, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and	17
ASV	Esther	3	14	A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published unto all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.	17
ASV	Esther	3	15	The posts went forth in haste by the kings commandment, and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed.	17
ASV	Esther	4	1	Now when Mordecai knew all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;	17
ASV	Esther	4	2	and he came even before the kings gate: for none might enter within the kings gate clothed with sackcloth.	17
ASV	Esther	4	3	And in every province, whithersoever the kings commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.	17
ASV	Esther	4	4	And Esthers maidens and her chamberlains came and told it her; and the queen was exceedingly grieved: and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take his sackcloth from off him; but he received it not.	17
ASV	Esther	4	5	Then called Esther for Hathach, one of the kings chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and charged him to go to Mordecai, to know what this was, and why it was.	17
ASV	Esther	4	6	So Hathach went forth to Mordecai unto the broad place of the city, which was before the kings gate.	17
ASV	Esther	4	7	And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the kings treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.	17
ASV	Esther	4	8	Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make req	17
ASV	Esther	4	9	And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.	17
ASV	Esther	4	10	Then Esther spake unto Hathach, and gave him a message unto Mordecai saying:	17
ASV	Esther	4	11	All the kings servants, and the people of the kings provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the kin	17
ASV	Esther	4	12	And they told to Mordecai Esthers words.	17
ASV	Esther	4	13	Then Mordecai bade them return answer unto Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the kings house, more than all the Jews.	17
ASV	Esther	4	14	For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then will relief and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy fathers house will perish: and who knoweth whether thou art not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?	17
ASV	Esther	4	15	Then Esther bade them return answer unto Mordecai,	17
ASV	Esther	4	16	Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast in like manner; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and	17
ASV	Esther	4	17	So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.	17
ASV	Esther	5	1	Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the kings house, over against the kings house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the entrance of the house.	17
ASV	Esther	5	2	And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.	17
ASV	Esther	5	3	Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be given thee even to the half of the kingdom.	17
ASV	Esther	5	4	And Esther said, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.	17
ASV	Esther	5	5	Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that it may be done as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.	17
ASV	Esther	5	6	And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.	17
ASV	Esther	5	7	Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is:	17
ASV	Esther	5	8	if I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to-morrow as the king hath said.	17
ASV	Esther	5	9	Then went Haman forth that day joyful and glad of heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the kings gate, that he stood not up nor moved for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.	17
ASV	Esther	5	10	Nevertheless Haman refrained himself, and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and Zeresh his wife.	17
ASV	Esther	5	11	And Haman recounted unto them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.	17
ASV	Esther	5	12	Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to-morrow also am I invited by her together with the king.	17
ASV	Esther	5	13	Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the kings gate.	17
ASV	Esther	5	14	Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased	17
ASV	Esther	6	1	On that night could not the king sleep; and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles, and they were read before the king.	17
ASV	Esther	6	2	And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the kings chamberlains, of those that kept the threshold, who had sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.	17
ASV	Esther	6	3	And the king said, What honor and dignity hath been bestowed on Mordecai for this? Then said the kings servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.	17
ASV	Esther	6	4	And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the kings house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.	17
ASV	Esther	6	5	And the kings servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.	17
ASV	Esther	6	6	So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor? Now Haman said in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself?	17
ASV	Esther	6	7	And Haman said unto the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honor,	17
ASV	Esther	6	8	let royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and on the head of which a crown royal is set:	17
ASV	Esther	6	9	and let the apparel and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the kings most noble princes, that they may array the man therewith whom the king delighteth to honor, and cause him to ride on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim bef	17
ASV	Esther	6	10	Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the kings gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.	17
ASV	Esther	6	11	Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor.	17
ASV	Esther	6	12	And Mordecai came again to the kings gate. But Haman hasted to his house, mourning and having his head covered.	17
ASV	Esther	6	13	And Haman recounted unto Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai, before whom thou hast begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, thou shalt not prevail agains	17
ASV	Esther	6	14	While they were yet talking with him, came the kings chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.	17
ASV	Esther	7	1	So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.	17
ASV	Esther	7	2	And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.	17
ASV	Esther	7	3	Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:	17
ASV	Esther	7	4	for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the kings damage.	17
ASV	Esther	7	5	Then spake the king Ahasuerus and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?	17
ASV	Esther	7	6	And Esther said, An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.	17
ASV	Esther	7	7	And the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.	17
ASV	Esther	7	8	Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the couch whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he even force the queen before me in the house? As the word went out of the kings mouth	17
ASV	Esther	7	9	Then said Harbonah, one of the chamberlains that were before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman hath made for Mordecai, who spake good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. And the king said, Hang him thereon.	17
ASV	Esther	7	10	So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the kings wrath pacified.	17
ASV	Esther	8	1	On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.	17
ASV	Esther	8	2	And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.	17
ASV	Esther	8	3	And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.	17
ASV	Esther	8	4	Then the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre. So Esther arose, and stood before the king.	17
ASV	Esther	8	5	And she said, If it please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wr	17
ASV	Esther	8	6	for how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?	17
ASV	Esther	8	7	Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.	17
ASV	Esther	8	8	Write ye also to the Jews, as it pleaseth you, in the kings name, and seal it with the kings ring; for the writing which is written in the kings name, and sealed with the kings ring, may no man reverse.	17
ASV	Esther	8	9	Then were the kings scribes called at that time, in the third month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the satraps, and the governors and princes of the province	17
ASV	Esther	8	10	And he wrote the name of king Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the kings ring, and sent letters by post on horseback, riding on swift steeds that were used in the kings service, bred of the stud:	17
ASV	Esther	8	11	wherein the king granted the Jews that were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, their little ones and wome	17
ASV	Esther	8	12	upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.	17
ASV	Esther	8	13	A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published unto all the peoples, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.	17
ASV	Esther	8	14	So the posts that rode upon swift steeds that were used in the kings service went out, being hastened and pressed on by the kings commandment; and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace.	17
ASV	Esther	8	15	And Mordecai went forth from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a robe of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan shouted and was glad.	17
ASV	Esther	8	16	The Jews had light and gladness, and joy and honor.	17
ASV	Esther	8	17	And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the kings commandment and his decree came, the Jews had gladness and joy, a feast and a good day. And many from among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews was fallen upon the	17
ASV	Esther	9	1	Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the kings commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have rule over them, (whereas it was turned	17
ASV	Esther	9	2	the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them was fallen upon all the peoples.	17
ASV	Esther	9	3	And all the princes of the provinces, and the satraps, and the governors, and they that did the kings business, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai was fallen upon them.	17
ASV	Esther	9	4	For Mordecai was great in the kings house, and his fame went forth throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai waxed greater and greater.	17
ASV	Esther	9	5	And the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they would unto them that hated them.	17
ASV	Esther	9	6	And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.	17
ASV	Esther	9	7	And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,	17
ASV	Esther	9	8	and Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,	17
ASV	Esther	9	9	and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vaizatha,	17
ASV	Esther	9	10	the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews enemy, slew they; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.	17
ASV	Esther	9	11	On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.	17
ASV	Esther	9	12	And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the kings provinces! Now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted th	17
ASV	Esther	9	13	Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews that are in Shushan to do to-morrow also according unto this days decree, and let Hamans ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.	17
ASV	Esther	9	14	And the king commanded it so to be done: and a decree was given out in Shushan; and they hanged Hamans ten sons.	17
ASV	Esther	9	15	And the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men in Shushan; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.	17
ASV	Esther	9	16	And the other Jews that were in the kings provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of them that hated them seventy and five thousand; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.	17
ASV	Esther	9	17	This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.	17
ASV	Esther	9	18	But the Jews that were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.	17
ASV	Esther	9	19	Therefore do the Jews of the villages, that dwell in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.	17
ASV	Esther	9	20	And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far,	17
ASV	Esther	9	21	to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,	17
ASV	Esther	9	22	as the days wherein the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending portions one to another	17
ASV	Esther	9	23	And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;	17
ASV	Esther	9	24	because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;	17
ASV	Esther	9	25	but when the matter came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.	17
ASV	Esther	9	26	Wherefore they called these days Purim, after the name of Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come unto them,	17
ASV	Esther	9	27	the Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so that it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to the writing thereof, and according to the appointed time thereof, ev	17
ASV	Esther	9	28	and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the remembrance of them perish from their seed.	17
ASV	Esther	9	29	Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim.	17
ASV	Esther	9	30	And he sent letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,	17
ASV	Esther	9	31	to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had ordained for themselves and for their seed, in the matter of the fastings and their cry.	17
ASV	Esther	9	32	And the commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.	17
ASV	Esther	10	1	And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea.	17
ASV	Esther	10	2	And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?	17
ASV	Esther	10	3	For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the good of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.	17
ASV	Job	1	1	There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and turned away from evil.	18
ASV	Job	1	2	And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.	18
ASV	Job	1	3	His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east.	18
ASV	Job	1	4	And his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one upon his day; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.	18
ASV	Job	1	5	And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and ren	18
ASV	Job	1	6	Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan also came among them.	18
ASV	Job	1	7	And Jehovah said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.	18
ASV	Job	1	8	And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil.	18
ASV	Job	1	9	Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?	18
ASV	Job	1	10	Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.	18
ASV	Job	1	11	But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will renounce thee to thy face.	18
ASV	Job	1	12	And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah.	18
ASV	Job	1	13	And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house,	18
ASV	Job	1	14	that there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them;	18
ASV	Job	1	15	and the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away: yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.	18
ASV	Job	1	16	While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.	18
ASV	Job	1	17	While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.	18
ASV	Job	1	18	While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house;	18
ASV	Job	1	19	and, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.	18
ASV	Job	1	20	Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped;	18
ASV	Job	1	21	and he said, Naked came I out of my mothers womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah.	18
ASV	Job	1	22	In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.	18
ASV	Job	2	1	Again it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan came also among them to present himself before Jehovah.	18
ASV	Job	2	2	And Jehovah said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.	18
ASV	Job	2	3	And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil: and he still holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me ag	18
ASV	Job	2	4	And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.	18
ASV	Job	2	5	But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce thee to thy face.	18
ASV	Job	2	6	And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand; only spare his life.	18
ASV	Job	2	7	So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.	18
ASV	Job	2	8	And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself therewith; and he sat among the ashes.	18
ASV	Job	2	9	Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still hold fast thine integrity? renounce God, and die.	18
ASV	Job	2	10	But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.	18
ASV	Job	2	11	Now when Jobs three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to	18
ASV	Job	2	12	And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his robe, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.	18
ASV	Job	2	13	So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.	18
ASV	Job	3	1	After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.	18
ASV	Job	3	2	And Job answered and said:	18
ASV	Job	3	3	Let the day perish wherein I was born, And the night which said, There is a man-child conceived.	18
ASV	Job	3	4	Let that day be darkness; Let not God from above seek for it, Neither let the light shine upon it.	18
ASV	Job	3	5	Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own; Let a cloud dwell upon it; Let all that maketh black the day terrify it.	18
ASV	Job	3	6	As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it: Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; Let it not come into the number of the months.	18
ASV	Job	3	7	Lo, let that night be barren; Let no joyful voice come therein.	18
ASV	Job	3	8	Let them curse it that curse the day, Who are ready to rouse up leviathan.	18
ASV	Job	3	9	Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark: Let it look for light, but have none; Neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning:	18
ASV	Job	3	10	Because it shut not up the doors of my mothers womb, Nor hid trouble from mine eyes.	18
ASV	Job	3	11	Why died I not from the womb? Why did I not give up the ghost when my mother bare me?	18
ASV	Job	3	12	Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breast, that I should suck?	18
ASV	Job	3	13	For now should I have lain down and been quiet; I should have slept; then had I been at rest,	18
ASV	Job	3	14	With kings and counsellors of the earth, Who built up waste places for themselves;	18
ASV	Job	3	15	Or with princes that had gold, Who filled their houses with silver:	18
ASV	Job	3	16	Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, As infants that never saw light.	18
ASV	Job	3	17	There the wicked cease from troubling; And there the weary are at rest.	18
ASV	Job	3	18	There the prisoners are at ease together; They hear not the voice of the taskmaster.	18
ASV	Job	3	19	The small and the great are there: And the servant is free from his master.	18
ASV	Job	3	20	Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, And life unto the bitter in soul;	18
ASV	Job	3	21	Who long for death, but it cometh not, And dig for it more than for hid treasures;	18
ASV	Job	3	22	Who rejoice exceedingly, And are glad, when they can find the grave?	18
ASV	Job	3	23	Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, And whom God hath hedged in?	18
ASV	Job	3	24	For my sighing cometh before I eat, And my groanings are poured out like water.	18
ASV	Job	3	25	For the thing which I fear cometh upon me, And that which I am afraid of cometh unto me.	18
ASV	Job	3	26	I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest; But trouble cometh.	18
ASV	Job	4	1	Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,	18
ASV	Job	4	2	If one assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? But who can withhold himself from speaking?	18
ASV	Job	4	3	Behold, thou hast instructed many, And thou hast strengthened the weak hands.	18
ASV	Job	4	4	Thy words have upholden him that was falling, And thou hast made firm the feeble knees.	18
ASV	Job	4	5	But now it is come unto thee, and thou faintest; It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.	18
ASV	Job	4	6	Is not thy fear of God thy confidence, And the integrity of thy ways thy hope?	18
ASV	Job	4	7	Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off?	18
ASV	Job	4	8	According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, And sow trouble, reap the same.	18
ASV	Job	4	9	By the breath of God they perish, And by the blast of his anger are they consumed.	18
ASV	Job	4	10	The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, And the teeth of the young lions, are broken.	18
ASV	Job	4	11	The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, And the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.	18
ASV	Job	4	12	Now a thing was secretly brought to me, And mine ear received a whisper thereof.	18
ASV	Job	4	13	In thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falleth on men,	18
ASV	Job	4	14	Fear came upon me, and trembling, Which made all my bones to shake.	18
ASV	Job	4	15	Then a spirit passed before my face; The hair of my flesh stood up.	18
ASV	Job	4	16	It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance thereof; A form was before mine eyes: There was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,	18
ASV	Job	4	17	Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?	18
ASV	Job	4	18	Behold, he putteth no trust in his servants; And his angels he chargeth with folly:	18
ASV	Job	4	19	How much more them that dwell in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, Who are crushed before the moth!	18
ASV	Job	4	20	Betwixt morning and evening they are destroyed: They perish for ever without any regarding it.	18
ASV	Job	4	21	Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them? They die, and that without wisdom.	18
ASV	Job	5	1	Call now; is there any that will answer thee? And to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?	18
ASV	Job	5	2	For vexation killeth the foolish man, And jealousy slayeth the silly one.	18
ASV	Job	5	3	I have seen the foolish taking root: But suddenly I cursed his habitation.	18
ASV	Job	5	4	His children are far from safety, And they are crushed in the gate, Neither is there any to deliver them:	18
ASV	Job	5	5	Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, And taketh it even out of the thorns; And the snare gapeth for their substance.	18
ASV	Job	5	6	For affliction cometh not forth from the dust, Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;	18
ASV	Job	5	7	But man is born unto trouble, As the sparks fly upward.	18
ASV	Job	5	8	But as for me, I would seek unto God, And unto God would I commit my cause;	18
ASV	Job	5	9	Who doeth great things and unsearchable, Marvellous things without number:	18
ASV	Job	5	10	Who giveth rain upon the earth, And sendeth waters upon the fields;	18
ASV	Job	5	11	So that he setteth up on high those that are low, And those that mourn are exalted to safety.	18
ASV	Job	5	12	He frustrateth the devices of the crafty, So that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.	18
ASV	Job	5	13	He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; And the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.	18
ASV	Job	5	14	They meet with darkness in the day-time, And grope at noonday as in the night.	18
ASV	Job	5	15	But he saveth from the sword of their mouth, Even the needy from the hand of the mighty.	18
ASV	Job	5	16	So the poor hath hope, And iniquity stoppeth her mouth.	18
ASV	Job	5	17	Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty.	18
ASV	Job	5	18	For he maketh sore, and bindeth up; He woundeth, and his hands make whole.	18
ASV	Job	5	19	He will deliver thee in six troubles; Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.	18
ASV	Job	5	20	In famine he will redeem thee from death; And in war from the power of the sword.	18
ASV	Job	5	21	Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue; Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.	18
ASV	Job	5	22	At destruction and dearth thou shalt laugh; Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.	18
ASV	Job	5	23	For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field; And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.	18
ASV	Job	5	24	And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace; And thou shalt visit thy fold, and shalt miss nothing.	18
ASV	Job	5	25	Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, And thine offspring as the grass of the earth.	18
ASV	Job	5	26	Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, Like as a shock of grain cometh in in its season.	18
ASV	Job	5	27	Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; Hear it, and know thou it for thy good.	18
ASV	Job	6	1	Then Job answered and said,	18
ASV	Job	6	2	Oh that my vexation were but weighed, And all my calamity laid in the balances!	18
ASV	Job	6	3	For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas: Therefore have my words been rash.	18
ASV	Job	6	4	For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, The poison whereof my spirit drinketh up: The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.	18
ASV	Job	6	5	Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? Or loweth the ox over his fodder?	18
ASV	Job	6	6	Can that which hath no savor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?	18
ASV	Job	6	7	My soul refuseth to touch them; They are as loathsome food to me.	18
ASV	Job	6	8	Oh that I might have my request; And that God would grant me the thing that I long for!	18
ASV	Job	6	9	Even that it would please God to crush me; That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!	18
ASV	Job	6	10	And be it still my consolation, Yea, let me exult in pain that spareth not, That I have not denied the words of the Holy One.	18
ASV	Job	6	11	What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is mine end, that I should be patient?	18
ASV	Job	6	12	Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of brass?	18
ASV	Job	6	13	Is it not that I have no help in me, And that wisdom is driven quite from me?	18
ASV	Job	6	14	To him that is ready to faint kindness should be showed from his friend; Even to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.	18
ASV	Job	6	15	My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, As the channel of brooks that pass away;	18
ASV	Job	6	16	Which are black by reason of the ice, And wherein the snow hideth itself:	18
ASV	Job	6	17	What time they wax warm, they vanish; When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.	18
ASV	Job	6	18	The caravans that travel by the way of them turn aside; They go up into the waste, and perish.	18
ASV	Job	6	19	The caravans of Tema looked, The companies of Sheba waited for them.	18
ASV	Job	6	20	They were put to shame because they had hoped; They came thither, and were confounded.	18
ASV	Job	6	21	For now ye are nothing; Ye see a terror, and are afraid.	18
ASV	Job	6	22	Did I say, Give unto me? Or, Offer a present for me of your substance?	18
ASV	Job	6	23	Or, Deliver me from the adversarys hand? Or, Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?	18
ASV	Job	6	24	Teach me, and I will hold my peace; And cause me to understand wherein I have erred.	18
ASV	Job	6	25	How forcible are words of uprightness! But your reproof, what doth it reprove?	18
ASV	Job	6	26	Do ye think to reprove words, Seeing that the speeches of one that is desperate are as wind?	18
ASV	Job	6	27	Yea, ye would cast lots upon the fatherless, And make merchandise of your friend.	18
ASV	Job	6	28	Now therefore be pleased to look upon me; For surely I shall not lie to your face.	18
ASV	Job	6	29	Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice; Yea, return again, my cause is righteous.	18
ASV	Job	6	30	Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern mischievous things?	18
ASV	Job	7	1	Is there not a warfare to man upon earth? And are not his days like the days of a hireling?	18
ASV	Job	7	2	As a servant that earnestly desireth the shadow, And as a hireling that looketh for his wages:	18
ASV	Job	7	3	So am I made to possess months of misery, And wearisome nights are appointed to me.	18
ASV	Job	7	4	When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? And I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.	18
ASV	Job	7	5	My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; My skin closeth up, and breaketh out afresh.	18
ASV	Job	7	6	My days are swifter than a weavers shuttle, And are spent without hope.	18
ASV	Job	7	7	Oh remember that my life is a breath: Mine eye shall no more see good.	18
ASV	Job	7	8	The eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more; Thine eyes shall be upon me, but I shall not be.	18
ASV	Job	7	9	As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away, So he that goeth down to Sheol shall come up no more.	18
ASV	Job	7	10	He shall return no more to his house, Neither shall his place know him any more.	18
ASV	Job	7	11	Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.	18
ASV	Job	7	12	Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, That thou settest a watch over me?	18
ASV	Job	7	13	When I say, My bed shall comfort me, My couch shall ease my complaint;	18
ASV	Job	7	14	Then thou scarest me with dreams, And terrifiest me through visions:	18
ASV	Job	7	15	So that my soul chooseth strangling, And death rather than these my bones.	18
ASV	Job	7	16	I loathe my life; I would not live alway: Let me alone; for my days are vanity.	18
ASV	Job	7	17	What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him, And that thou shouldest set thy mind upon him,	18
ASV	Job	7	18	And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, And try him every moment?	18
ASV	Job	7	19	How long wilt thou not look away from me, Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?	18
ASV	Job	7	20	If I have sinned, what do I unto thee, O thou watcher of men? Why hast thou set me as a mark for thee, So that I am a burden to myself?	18
ASV	Job	7	21	And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? For now shall I lie down in the dust; And thou wilt seek me diligently, but I shall not be.	18
ASV	Job	8	1	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,	18
ASV	Job	8	2	How long wilt thou speak these things? And how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a mighty wind?	18
ASV	Job	8	3	Doth God pervert justice? Or doth the Almighty pervert righteousness?	18
ASV	Job	8	4	If thy children have sinned against him, And he hath delivered them into the hand of their transgression;	18
ASV	Job	8	5	If thou wouldest seek diligently unto God, And make thy supplication to the Almighty;	18
ASV	Job	8	6	If thou wert pure and upright: Surely now he would awake for thee, And make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.	18
ASV	Job	8	7	And though thy beginning was small, Yet thy latter end would greatly increase.	18
ASV	Job	8	8	For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, And apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out:	18
ASV	Job	8	9	(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, Because our days upon earth are a shadow);	18
ASV	Job	8	10	Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, And utter words out of their heart?	18
ASV	Job	8	11	Can the rush grow up without mire? Can the flag grow without water?	18
ASV	Job	8	12	Whilst it is yet in its greenness, and not cut down, It withereth before any other herb.	18
ASV	Job	8	13	So are the paths of all that forget God; And the hope of the godless man shall perish:	18
ASV	Job	8	14	Whose confidence shall break in sunder, And whose trust is a spiders web.	18
ASV	Job	8	15	He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: He shall hold fast thereby, but it shall not endure.	18
ASV	Job	8	16	He is green before the sun, And his shoots go forth over his garden.	18
ASV	Job	8	17	His roots are wrapped about the stone -heap, He beholdeth the place of stones.	18
ASV	Job	8	18	If he be destroyed from his place, Then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.	18
ASV	Job	8	19	Behold, this is the joy of his way; And out of the earth shall others spring.	18
ASV	Job	8	20	Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, Neither will he uphold the evil-doers.	18
ASV	Job	8	21	He will yet fill thy mouth with laughter, And thy lips with shouting.	18
ASV	Job	8	22	They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; And the tent of the wicked shall be no more.	18
ASV	Job	9	1	Then Job answered and said,	18
ASV	Job	9	2	Of a truth I know that it is so: But how can man be just with God?	18
ASV	Job	9	3	If he be pleased to contend with him, He cannot answer him one of a thousand.	18
ASV	Job	9	4	He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: Who hath hardened himself against him, and prospered?-	18
ASV	Job	9	5	Him that removeth the mountains, and they know it not, When he overturneth them in his anger;	18
ASV	Job	9	6	That shaketh the earth out of its place, And the pillars thereof tremble;	18
ASV	Job	9	7	That commandeth the sun, and it riseth not, And sealeth up the stars;	18
ASV	Job	9	8	That alone stretcheth out the heavens, And treadeth upon the waves of the sea;	18
ASV	Job	9	9	That maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, And the chambers of the south;	18
ASV	Job	9	10	That doeth great things past finding out, Yea, marvellous things without number.	18
ASV	Job	9	11	Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: He passeth on also, but I perceive him not.	18
ASV	Job	9	12	Behold, he seizeth the prey, who can hinder him? Who will say unto him, What doest thou?	18
ASV	Job	9	13	God will not withdraw his anger; The helpers of Rahab do stoop under him.	18
ASV	Job	9	14	How much less shall I answer him, And choose out my words to reason with him?	18
ASV	Job	9	15	Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer; I would make supplication to my judge.	18
ASV	Job	9	16	If I had called, and he had answered me, Yet would I not believe that he hearkened unto my voice.	18
ASV	Job	9	17	For he breaketh me with a tempest, And multiplieth my wounds without cause.	18
ASV	Job	9	18	He will not suffer me to take my breath, But filleth me with bitterness.	18
ASV	Job	9	19	If we speak of strength, lo, he is mighty! And if of justice, Who, saith he, will summon me?	18
ASV	Job	9	20	Though I be righteous, mine own mouth shall condemn me: Though I be perfect, it shall prove me perverse.	18
ASV	Job	9	21	I am perfect; I regard not myself; I despise my life.	18
ASV	Job	9	22	It is all one; therefore I say, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.	18
ASV	Job	9	23	If the scourge slay suddenly, He will mock at the trial of the innocent.	18
ASV	Job	9	24	The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He covereth the faces of the judges thereof: If it be not he, who then is it?	18
ASV	Job	9	25	Now my days are swifter than a post: They flee away, they see no good,	18
ASV	Job	9	26	They are passed away as the swift ships; As the eagle that swoopeth on the prey.	18
ASV	Job	9	27	If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad countenance, and be of good cheer;	18
ASV	Job	9	28	I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.	18
ASV	Job	9	29	I shall be condemned; Why then do I labor in vain?	18
ASV	Job	9	30	If I wash myself with snow water, And make my hands never so clean;	18
ASV	Job	9	31	Yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch, And mine own clothes shall abhor me.	18
ASV	Job	9	32	For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, That we should come together in judgment.	18
ASV	Job	9	33	There is no umpire betwixt us, That might lay his hand upon us both.	18
ASV	Job	9	34	Let him take his rod away from me, And let not his terror make me afraid:	18
ASV	Job	9	35	Then would I speak, and not fear him; For I am not so in myself.	18
ASV	Job	10	1	My soul is weary of my life; I will give free course to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.	18
ASV	Job	10	2	I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; Show me wherefore thou contendest with me.	18
ASV	Job	10	3	Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, That thou shouldest despise the work of thy hands, And shine upon the counsel of the wicked?	18
ASV	Job	10	4	Hast thou eyes of flesh? Or seest thou as man seeth?	18
ASV	Job	10	5	Are thy days as the days of man, Or thy years as mans days,	18
ASV	Job	10	6	That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, And searchest after my sin,	18
ASV	Job	10	7	Although thou knowest that I am not wicked, And there is none that can deliver out of thy hand?	18
ASV	Job	10	8	Thy hands have framed me and fashioned me Together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.	18
ASV	Job	10	9	Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast fashioned me as clay; And wilt thou bring me into dust again?	18
ASV	Job	10	10	Hast thou not poured me out as milk, And curdled me like cheese?	18
ASV	Job	10	11	Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, And knit me together with bones and sinews.	18
ASV	Job	10	12	Thou hast granted me life and lovingkindness; And thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.	18
ASV	Job	10	13	Yet these things thou didst hide in thy heart; I know that this is with thee:	18
ASV	Job	10	14	If I sin, then thou markest me, And thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.	18
ASV	Job	10	15	If I be wicked, woe unto me; And if I be righteous, yet shall I not lift up my head; Being filled with ignominy, And looking upon mine affliction.	18
ASV	Job	10	16	And if my head exalt itself, thou huntest me as a lion; And again thou showest thyself marvellous upon me.	18
ASV	Job	10	17	Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, And increasest thine indignation upon me: Changes and warfare are with me.	18
ASV	Job	10	18	Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me.	18
ASV	Job	10	19	I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.	18
ASV	Job	10	20	Are not my days few? cease then, And let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,	18
ASV	Job	10	21	Before I go whence I shall not return, Even to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;	18
ASV	Job	10	22	The land dark as midnight, The land of the shadow of death, without any order, And where the light is as midnight.	18
ASV	Job	11	1	Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,	18
ASV	Job	11	2	Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk be justified?	18
ASV	Job	11	3	Should thy boastings make men hold their peace? And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?	18
ASV	Job	11	4	For thou sayest, My doctrine is pure, And I am clean in thine eyes.	18
ASV	Job	11	5	But oh that God would speak, And open his lips against thee,	18
ASV	Job	11	6	And that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom! For he is manifold in understanding. Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.	18
ASV	Job	11	7	Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?	18
ASV	Job	11	8	It is high as heaven; what canst thou do? Deeper than Sheol; what canst thou know?	18
ASV	Job	11	9	The measure thereof is longer than the earth, And broader than the sea.	18
ASV	Job	11	10	If he pass through, and shut up, And all unto judgment, then who can hinder him?	18
ASV	Job	11	11	For he knoweth false men: He seeth iniquity also, even though he consider it not.	18
ASV	Job	11	12	But vain man is void of understanding, Yea, man is born as a wild asss colt.	18
ASV	Job	11	13	If thou set thy heart aright, And stretch out thy hands toward him;	18
ASV	Job	11	14	If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away, And let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents.	18
ASV	Job	11	15	Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; Yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:	18
ASV	Job	11	16	For thou shalt forget thy misery; Thou shalt remember it as waters that are passed away,	18
ASV	Job	11	17	And thy life shall be clearer than the noonday; Though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning.	18
ASV	Job	11	18	And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; Yea, thou shalt search about thee, and shalt take thy rest in safety.	18
ASV	Job	11	19	Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; Yea, many shall make suit unto thee.	18
ASV	Job	11	20	But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, And they shall have no way to flee; And their hope shall be the giving up of the ghost.	18
ASV	Job	12	1	Then Job answered and said,	18
ASV	Job	12	2	No doubt but ye are the people, And wisdom shall die with you.	18
ASV	Job	12	3	But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: Yea, who knoweth not such things as these?	18
ASV	Job	12	4	I am as one that is a laughing-stock to his neighbor, I who called upon God, and he answered: The just, the perfect man is a laughing-stock.	18
ASV	Job	12	5	In the thought of him that is at ease there is contempt for misfortune; It is ready for them whose foot slippeth.	18
ASV	Job	12	6	The tents of robbers prosper, And they that provoke God are secure; Into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.	18
ASV	Job	12	7	But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; And the birds of the heavens, and they shall tell thee:	18
ASV	Job	12	8	Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee; And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.	18
ASV	Job	12	9	Who knoweth not in all these, That the hand of Jehovah hath wrought this,	18
ASV	Job	12	10	In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, And the breath of all mankind?	18
ASV	Job	12	11	Doth not the ear try words, Even as the palate tasteth its food?	18
ASV	Job	12	12	With aged men is wisdom, And in length of days understanding.	18
ASV	Job	12	13	With God is wisdom and might; He hath counsel and understanding.	18
ASV	Job	12	14	Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again; He shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.	18
ASV	Job	12	15	Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up; Again, he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.	18
ASV	Job	12	16	With him is strength and wisdom; The deceived and the deceiver are his.	18
ASV	Job	12	17	He leadeth counsellors away stripped, And judges maketh he fools.	18
ASV	Job	12	18	He looseth the bond of kings, And he bindeth their loins with a girdle.	18
ASV	Job	12	19	He leadeth priests away stripped, And overthroweth the mighty.	18
ASV	Job	12	20	He removeth the speech of the trusty, And taketh away the understanding of the elders.	18
ASV	Job	12	21	He poureth contempt upon princes, And looseth the belt of the strong.	18
ASV	Job	12	22	He uncovereth deep things out of darkness, And bringeth out to light the shadow of death.	18
ASV	Job	12	23	He increaseth the nations, and he destroyeth them: He enlargeth the nations, and he leadeth them captive.	18
ASV	Job	12	24	He taketh away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth, And causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.	18
ASV	Job	12	25	They grope in the dark without light; And he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.	18
ASV	Job	13	1	Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, Mine ear hath heard and understood it.	18
ASV	Job	13	2	What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.	18
ASV	Job	13	3	Surely I would speak to the Almighty, And I desire to reason with God.	18
ASV	Job	13	4	But ye are forgers of lies; Ye are all physicians of no value.	18
ASV	Job	13	5	Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace! And it would be your wisdom.	18
ASV	Job	13	6	Hear now my reasoning, And hearken to the pleadings of my lips.	18
ASV	Job	13	7	Will ye speak unrighteously for God, And talk deceitfully for him?	18
ASV	Job	13	8	Will ye show partiality to him? Will ye contend for God?	18
ASV	Job	13	9	Is it good that he should search you out? Or as one deceiveth a man, will ye deceive him?	18
ASV	Job	13	10	He will surely reprove you If ye do secretly show partiality.	18
ASV	Job	13	11	Shall not his majesty make you afraid, And his dread fall upon you?	18
ASV	Job	13	12	Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your defences are defences of clay.	18
ASV	Job	13	13	Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak; And let come on me what will.	18
ASV	Job	13	14	Wherefore should I take my flesh in my teeth, And put my life in my hand?	18
ASV	Job	13	15	Behold, he will slay me; I have no hope: Nevertheless I will maintain my ways before him.	18
ASV	Job	13	16	This also shall be my salvation, That a godless man shall not come before him.	18
ASV	Job	13	17	Hear diligently my speech, And let my declaration be in your ears.	18
ASV	Job	13	18	Behold now, I have set my cause in order; I know that I am righteous.	18
ASV	Job	13	19	Who is he that will contend with me? For then would I hold my peace and give up the ghost.	18
ASV	Job	13	20	Only do not two things unto me; Then will I not hide myself from thy face:	18
ASV	Job	13	21	Withdraw thy hand far from me; And let not thy terror make me afraid.	18
ASV	Job	13	22	Then call thou, and I will answer; Or let me speak, and answer thou me.	18
ASV	Job	13	23	How many are mine iniquities and sins? Make me to know my transgression and my sin.	18
ASV	Job	13	24	Wherefore hidest thou thy face, And holdest me for thine enemy?	18
ASV	Job	13	25	Wilt thou harass a driven leaf? And wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?	18
ASV	Job	13	26	For thou writest bitter things against me, And makest me to inherit the iniquities of my youth:	18
ASV	Job	13	27	Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, And markest all my paths; Thou settest a bound to the soles of my feet:	18
ASV	Job	13	28	Though I am like a rotten thing that consumeth, Like a garment that is moth-eaten.	18
ASV	Job	14	1	Man, that is born of a woman, Is of few days, and full of trouble.	18
ASV	Job	14	2	He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.	18
ASV	Job	14	3	And dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one, And bringest me into judgment with thee?	18
ASV	Job	14	4	Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.	18
ASV	Job	14	5	Seeing his days are determined, The number of his months is with thee, And thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;	18
ASV	Job	14	6	Look away from him, that he may rest, Till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day.	18
ASV	Job	14	7	For there is hope of a tree, If it be cut down, that it will sprout again, And that the tender branch thereof will not cease.	18
ASV	Job	14	8	Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, And the stock thereof die in the ground;	18
ASV	Job	14	9	Yet through the scent of water it will bud, And put forth boughs like a plant.	18
ASV	Job	14	10	But man dieth, and is laid low: Yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?	18
ASV	Job	14	11	As the waters fail from the sea, And the river wasteth and drieth up;	18
ASV	Job	14	12	So man lieth down and riseth not: Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, Nor be roused out of their sleep.	18
ASV	Job	14	13	Oh that thou wouldest hide me in Sheol, That thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, That thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!	18
ASV	Job	14	14	If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my warfare would I wait, Till my release should come.	18
ASV	Job	14	15	Thou wouldest call, and I would answer thee: Thou wouldest have a desire to the work of thy hands.	18
ASV	Job	14	16	But now thou numberest my steps: Dost thou not watch over my sin?	18
ASV	Job	14	17	My transgression is sealed up in a bag, And thou fastenest up mine iniquity.	18
ASV	Job	14	18	But the mountain falling cometh to nought; And the rock is removed out of its place;	18
ASV	Job	14	19	The waters wear the stones; The overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth: So thou destroyest the hope of man.	18
ASV	Job	14	20	Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth; Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.	18
ASV	Job	14	21	His sons come to honor, and he knoweth it not; And they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.	18
ASV	Job	14	22	But his flesh upon him hath pain, And his soul within him mourneth.	18
ASV	Job	15	1	Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,	18
ASV	Job	15	2	Should a wise man make answer with vain knowledge, And fill himself with the east wind?	18
ASV	Job	15	3	Should he reason with unprofitable talk, Or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?	18
ASV	Job	15	4	Yea, thou doest away with fear, And hinderest devotion before God.	18
ASV	Job	15	5	For thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth, And thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.	18
ASV	Job	15	6	Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I; Yea, thine own lips testify against thee.	18
ASV	Job	15	7	Art thou the first man that was born? Or wast thou brought forth before the hills?	18
ASV	Job	15	8	Hast thou heard the secret counsel of God? And dost thou limit wisdom to thyself?	18
ASV	Job	15	9	What knowest thou, that we know not? What understandest thou, which is not in us?	18
ASV	Job	15	10	With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men, Much elder than thy father.	18
ASV	Job	15	11	Are the consolations of God too small for thee, Even the word that is gentle toward thee?	18
ASV	Job	15	12	Why doth thy heart carry thee away? And why do thine eyes flash,	18
ASV	Job	15	13	That against God thou turnest thy spirit, And lettest words go out of thy mouth?	18
ASV	Job	15	14	What is man, that he should be clean? And he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?	18
ASV	Job	15	15	Behold, he putteth no trust in his holy ones; Yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight:	18
ASV	Job	15	16	How much less one that is abominable and corrupt, A man that drinketh iniquity like water!	18
ASV	Job	15	17	I will show thee, hear thou me; And that which I have seen I will declare:	18
ASV	Job	15	18	(Which wise men have told From their fathers, and have not hid it;	18
ASV	Job	15	19	Unto whom alone the land was given, And no stranger passed among them):	18
ASV	Job	15	20	The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, Even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.	18
ASV	Job	15	21	A sound of terrors is in his ears; In prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.	18
ASV	Job	15	22	He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, And he is waited for of the sword.	18
ASV	Job	15	23	He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.	18
ASV	Job	15	24	Distress and anguish make him afraid; They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.	18
ASV	Job	15	25	Because he hath stretched out his hand against God, And behaveth himself proudly against the Almighty;	18
ASV	Job	15	26	He runneth upon him with a stiff neck, With the thick bosses of his bucklers;	18
ASV	Job	15	27	Because he hath covered his face with his fatness, And gathered fat upon his loins;	18
ASV	Job	15	28	And he hath dwelt in desolate cities, In houses which no man inhabited, Which were ready to become heaps;	18
ASV	Job	15	29	He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, Neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth.	18
ASV	Job	15	30	He shall not depart out of darkness; The flame shall dry up his branches, And by the breath of Gods mouth shall he go away.	18
ASV	Job	15	31	Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself; For vanity shall be his recompense.	18
ASV	Job	15	32	It shall be accomplished before his time, And his branch shall not be green.	18
ASV	Job	15	33	He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, And shall cast off his flower as the olive-tree.	18
ASV	Job	15	34	For the company of the godless shall be barren, And fire shall consume the tents of bribery.	18
ASV	Job	15	35	They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity, And their heart prepareth deceit.	18
ASV	Job	16	1	Then Job answered and said,	18
ASV	Job	16	2	I have heard many such things: Miserable comforters are ye all.	18
ASV	Job	16	3	Shall vain words have an end? Or what provoketh thee that thou answerest?	18
ASV	Job	16	4	I also could speak as ye do; If your soul were in my souls stead, I could join words together against you, And shake my head at you.	18
ASV	Job	16	5	But I would strengthen you with my mouth, And the solace of my lips would assuage your grief.	18
ASV	Job	16	6	Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged; And though I forbear, what am I eased?	18
ASV	Job	16	7	But now he hath made me weary: Thou hast made desolate all my company.	18
ASV	Job	16	8	And thou hast laid fast hold on me, which is a witness against me: And my leanness riseth up against me, It testifieth to my face.	18
ASV	Job	16	9	He hath torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me; He hath gnashed upon me with his teeth: Mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me.	18
ASV	Job	16	10	They have gaped upon me with their mouth; They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully: They gather themselves together against me.	18
ASV	Job	16	11	God delivereth me to the ungodly, And casteth me into the hands of the wicked.	18
ASV	Job	16	12	I was at ease, and he brake me asunder; Yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces: He hath also set me up for his mark.	18
ASV	Job	16	13	His archers compass me round about; He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; He poureth out my gall upon the ground.	18
ASV	Job	16	14	He breaketh me with breach upon breach; He runneth upon me like a giant.	18
ASV	Job	16	15	I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, And have laid my horn in the dust.	18
ASV	Job	16	16	My face is red with weeping, And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;	18
ASV	Job	16	17	Although there is no violence in my hands, And my prayer is pure.	18
ASV	Job	16	18	O earth, cover not thou my blood, And let my cry have no resting -place.	18
ASV	Job	16	19	Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, And he that voucheth for me is on high.	18
ASV	Job	16	20	My friends scoff at me: But mine eye poureth out tears unto God,	18
ASV	Job	16	21	That he would maintain the right of a man with God, And of a son of man with his neighbor!	18
ASV	Job	16	22	For when a few years are come, I shall go the way whence I shall not return.	18
ASV	Job	17	1	My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct, The grave is ready for me.	18
ASV	Job	17	2	Surely there are mockers with me, And mine eye dwelleth upon their provocation.	18
ASV	Job	17	3	Give now a pledge, be surety for me with thyself; Who is there that will strike hands with me?	18
ASV	Job	17	4	For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: Therefore shalt thou not exalt them.	18
ASV	Job	17	5	He that denounceth his friends for a prey, Even the eyes of his children shall fail.	18
ASV	Job	17	6	But he hath made me a byword of the people; And they spit in my face.	18
ASV	Job	17	7	Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, And all my members are as a shadow.	18
ASV	Job	17	8	Upright men shall be astonished at this, And the innocent shall stir up himself against the godless.	18
ASV	Job	17	9	Yet shall the righteous hold on his way, And he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger.	18
ASV	Job	17	10	But as for you all, come on now again; And I shall not find a wise man among you.	18
ASV	Job	17	11	My days are past, my purposes are broken off, Even the thoughts of my heart.	18
ASV	Job	17	12	They change the night into day: The light, say they, is near unto the darkness.	18
ASV	Job	17	13	If I look for Sheol as my house; If I have spread my couch in the darkness;	18
ASV	Job	17	14	If I have said to corruption, Thou art my father; To the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister;	18
ASV	Job	17	15	Where then is my hope? And as for my hope, who shall see it?	18
ASV	Job	17	16	It shall go down to the bars of Sheol, When once there is rest in the dust.	18
ASV	Job	18	1	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,	18
ASV	Job	18	2	How long will ye hunt for words? Consider, and afterwards we will speak.	18
ASV	Job	18	3	Wherefore are we counted as beasts, And are become unclean in your sight?	18
ASV	Job	18	4	Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger, Shall the earth be forsaken for thee? Or shall the rock be removed out of its place?	18
ASV	Job	18	5	Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, And the spark of his fire shall not shine.	18
ASV	Job	18	6	The light shall be dark in his tent, And his lamp above him shall be put out.	18
ASV	Job	18	7	The steps of his strength shall be straitened, And his own counsel shall cast him down.	18
ASV	Job	18	8	For he is cast into a net by his own feet, And he walketh upon the toils.	18
ASV	Job	18	9	A gin shall take him by the heel, And a snare shall lay hold on him.	18
ASV	Job	18	10	A noose is hid for him in the ground, And a trap for him in the way.	18
ASV	Job	18	11	Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, And shall chase him at his heels.	18
ASV	Job	18	12	His strength shall be hunger-bitten, And calamity shall be ready at his side.	18
ASV	Job	18	13	The members of his body shall be devoured, Yea, the first-born of death shall devour his members.	18
ASV	Job	18	14	He shall be rooted out of his tent where he trusteth; And he shall be brought to the king of terrors.	18
ASV	Job	18	15	There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his: Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.	18
ASV	Job	18	16	His roots shall be dried up beneath, And above shall his branch be cut off.	18
ASV	Job	18	17	His remembrance shall perish from the earth, And he shall have no name in the street.	18
ASV	Job	18	18	He shall be driven from light into darkness, And chased out of the world.	18
ASV	Job	18	19	He shall have neither son nor sons son among his people, Nor any remaining where he sojourned.	18
ASV	Job	18	20	They that come after shall be astonished at his day, As they that went before were affrighted.	18
ASV	Job	18	21	Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous, And this is the place of him that knoweth not God.	18
ASV	Job	19	1	Then Job answered and said,	18
ASV	Job	19	2	How long will ye vex my soul, And break me in pieces with words?	18
ASV	Job	19	3	These ten times have ye reproached me: Ye are not ashamed that ye deal hardly with me.	18
ASV	Job	19	4	And be it indeed that I have erred, Mine error remaineth with myself.	18
ASV	Job	19	5	If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, And plead against me my reproach;	18
ASV	Job	19	6	Know now that God hath subverted me in my cause, And hath compassed me with his net.	18
ASV	Job	19	7	Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry for help, but there is no justice.	18
ASV	Job	19	8	He hath walled up my way that I cannot pass, And hath set darkness in my paths.	18
ASV	Job	19	9	He hath stripped me of my glory, And taken the crown from my head.	18
ASV	Job	19	10	He hath broken me down on every side, and I am gone; And my hope hath he plucked up like a tree.	18
ASV	Job	19	11	He hath also kindled his wrath against me, And he counteth me unto him as one of his adversaries.	18
ASV	Job	19	12	His troops come on together, And cast up their way against me, And encamp round about my tent.	18
ASV	Job	19	13	He hath put my brethren far from me, And mine acquaintance are wholly estranged from me.	18
ASV	Job	19	14	My kinsfolk have failed, And my familiar friends have forgotten me.	18
ASV	Job	19	15	They that dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger; I am an alien in their sight.	18
ASV	Job	19	16	I call unto my servant, and he giveth me no answer, Though I entreat him with my mouth.	18
ASV	Job	19	17	My breath is strange to my wife, And my supplication to the children of mine own mother.	18
ASV	Job	19	18	Even young children despise me; If I arise, they speak against me.	18
ASV	Job	19	19	All my familiar friends abhor me, And they whom I loved are turned against me.	18
ASV	Job	19	20	My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.	18
ASV	Job	19	21	Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; For the hand of God hath touched me.	18
ASV	Job	19	22	Why do ye persecute me as God, And are not satisfied with my flesh?	18
ASV	Job	19	23	Oh that my words were now written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book!	18
ASV	Job	19	24	That with an iron pen and lead They were graven in the rock for ever!	18
ASV	Job	19	25	But as for me I know that my Redeemer liveth, And at last he will stand up upon the earth:	18
ASV	Job	19	26	And after my skin, even this body, is destroyed, Then without my flesh shall I see God;	18
ASV	Job	19	27	Whom I, even I, shall see, on my side, And mine eyes shall behold, and not as a stranger. My heart is consumed within me.	18
ASV	Job	19	28	If ye say, How we will persecute him! And that the root of the matter is found in me;	18
ASV	Job	19	29	Be ye afraid of the sword: For wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, That ye may know there is a judgment.	18
ASV	Job	20	1	Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,	18
ASV	Job	20	2	Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, Even by reason of my haste that is in me.	18
ASV	Job	20	3	I have heard the reproof which putteth me to shame; And the spirit of my understanding answereth me.	18
ASV	Job	20	4	Knowest thou not this of old time, Since man was placed upon earth,	18
ASV	Job	20	5	That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the godless but for a moment?	18
ASV	Job	20	6	Though his height mount up to the heavens, And his head reach unto the clouds;	18
ASV	Job	20	7	Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: They that have seen him shall say, Where is he?	18
ASV	Job	20	8	He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.	18
ASV	Job	20	9	The eye which saw him shall see him no more; Neither shall his place any more behold him.	18
ASV	Job	20	10	His children shall seek the favor of the poor, And his hands shall give back his wealth.	18
ASV	Job	20	11	His bones are full of his youth, But it shall lie down with him in the dust.	18
ASV	Job	20	12	Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, Though he hide it under his tongue,	18
ASV	Job	20	13	Though he spare it, and will not let it go, But keep it still within his mouth;	18
ASV	Job	20	14	Yet his food in his bowels is turned, It is the gall of asps within him.	18
ASV	Job	20	15	He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again; God will cast them out of his belly.	18
ASV	Job	20	16	He shall suck the poison of asps: The vipers tongue shall slay him.	18
ASV	Job	20	17	He shall not look upon the rivers, The flowing streams of honey and butter.	18
ASV	Job	20	18	That which he labored for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down; According to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice.	18
ASV	Job	20	19	For he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor; He hath violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up.	18
ASV	Job	20	20	Because he knew no quietness within him, He shall not save aught of that wherein he delighteth.	18
ASV	Job	20	21	There was nothing left that he devoured not; Therefore his prosperity shall not endure.	18
ASV	Job	20	22	In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: The hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him.	18
ASV	Job	20	23	When he is about to fill his belly, God will cast the fierceness of his wrath upon him, And will rain it upon him while he is eating.	18
ASV	Job	20	24	He shall flee from the iron weapon, And the bow of brass shall strike him through.	18
ASV	Job	20	25	He draweth it forth, and it cometh out of his body; Yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall: Terrors are upon him.	18
ASV	Job	20	26	All darkness is laid up for his treasures: A fire not blown by man shall devour him; It shall consume that which is left in his tent.	18
ASV	Job	20	27	The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, And the earth shall rise up against him.	18
ASV	Job	20	28	The increase of his house shall depart; His goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.	18
ASV	Job	20	29	This is the portion of a wicked man from God, And the heritage appointed unto him by God.	18
ASV	Job	21	1	Then Job answered and said,	18
ASV	Job	21	2	Hear diligently my speech; And let this be your consolations.	18
ASV	Job	21	3	Suffer me, and I also will speak; And after that I have spoken, mock on.	18
ASV	Job	21	4	As for me, is my complaint to man? And why should I not be impatient?	18
ASV	Job	21	5	Mark me, and be astonished, And lay your hand upon your mouth.	18
ASV	Job	21	6	Even when I remember I am troubled, And horror taketh hold on my flesh.	18
ASV	Job	21	7	Wherefore do the wicked live, Become old, yea, wax mighty in power?	18
ASV	Job	21	8	Their seed is established with them in their sight, And their offspring before their eyes.	18
ASV	Job	21	9	Their houses are safe from fear, Neither is the rod of God upon them.	18
ASV	Job	21	10	Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.	18
ASV	Job	21	11	They send forth their little ones like a flock, And their children dance.	18
ASV	Job	21	12	They sing to the timbrel and harp, And rejoice at the sound of the pipe.	18
ASV	Job	21	13	They spend their days in prosperity, And in a moment they go down to Sheol.	18
ASV	Job	21	14	And they say unto God, Depart from us; For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.	18
ASV	Job	21	15	What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? And what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?	18
ASV	Job	21	16	Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand: The counsel of the wicked is far from me.	18
ASV	Job	21	17	How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? That their calamity cometh upon them? That God distributeth sorrows in his anger?	18
ASV	Job	21	18	That they are as stubble before the wind, And as chaff that the storm carrieth away?	18
ASV	Job	21	19	Ye say, God layeth up his iniquity for his children. Let him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it:	18
ASV	Job	21	20	Let his own eyes see his destruction, And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.	18
ASV	Job	21	21	For what careth he for his house after him, When the number of his months is cut off?	18
ASV	Job	21	22	Shall any teach God knowledge, Seeing he judgeth those that are high?	18
ASV	Job	21	23	One dieth in his full strength, Being wholly at ease and quiet:	18
ASV	Job	21	24	His pails are full of milk, And the marrow of his bones is moistened.	18
ASV	Job	21	25	And another dieth in bitterness of soul, And never tasteth of good.	18
ASV	Job	21	26	They lie down alike in the dust, And the worm covereth them.	18
ASV	Job	21	27	Behold, I know your thoughts, And the devices wherewith ye would wrong me.	18
ASV	Job	21	28	For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? And where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt?	18
ASV	Job	21	29	Have ye not asked wayfaring men? And do ye not know their evidences,	18
ASV	Job	21	30	That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity? That they are led forth to the day of wrath?	18
ASV	Job	21	31	Who shall declare his way to his face? And who shall repay him what he hath done?	18
ASV	Job	21	32	Yet shall he be borne to the grave, And men shall keep watch over the tomb.	18
ASV	Job	21	33	The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, And all men shall draw after him, As there were innumerable before him.	18
ASV	Job	21	34	How then comfort ye me in vain, Seeing in your answers there remaineth only falsehood?	18
ASV	Job	22	1	Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,	18
ASV	Job	22	2	Can a man be profitable unto God? Surely he that is wise is profitable unto himself.	18
ASV	Job	22	3	Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? Or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?	18
ASV	Job	22	4	Is it for thy fear of him that he reproveth thee, That he entereth with thee into judgment?	18
ASV	Job	22	5	Is not thy wickedness great? Neither is there any end to thine iniquities.	18
ASV	Job	22	6	For thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought, And stripped the naked of their clothing.	18
ASV	Job	22	7	Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.	18
ASV	Job	22	8	But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; And the honorable man, he dwelt in it.	18
ASV	Job	22	9	Thou hast sent widows away empty, And the arms of the fatherless have been broken.	18
ASV	Job	22	10	Therefore snares are round about thee, And sudden fear troubleth thee,	18
ASV	Job	22	11	Or darkness, so that thou canst not see, And abundance of waters cover thee.	18
ASV	Job	22	12	Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the stars, how high they are!	18
ASV	Job	22	13	And thou sayest, What doth God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness?	18
ASV	Job	22	14	Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he seeth not; And he walketh on the vault of heaven.	18
ASV	Job	22	15	Wilt thou keep the old way Which wicked men have trodden?	18
ASV	Job	22	16	Who were snatched away before their time, Whose foundation was poured out as a stream,	18
ASV	Job	22	17	Who said unto God, Depart from us; And, What can the Almighty do for us?	18
ASV	Job	22	18	Yet he filled their houses with good things: But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.	18
ASV	Job	22	19	The righteous see it, and are glad; And the innocent laugh them to scorn,	18
ASV	Job	22	20	Saying, Surely they that did rise up against us are cut off, And the remnant of them the fire hath consumed.	18
ASV	Job	22	21	Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: Thereby good shall come unto thee.	18
ASV	Job	22	22	Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, And lay up his words in thy heart.	18
ASV	Job	22	23	If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, If thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents.	18
ASV	Job	22	24	And lay thou thy treasure in the dust, And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks;	18
ASV	Job	22	25	And the Almighty will be thy treasure, And precious silver unto thee.	18
ASV	Job	22	26	For then shalt thou delight thyself in the Almighty, And shalt lift up thy face unto God.	18
ASV	Job	22	27	Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he will hear thee; And thou shalt pay thy vows.	18
ASV	Job	22	28	Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee; And light shall shine upon thy ways.	18
ASV	Job	22	29	When they cast thee down, thou shalt say, There is lifting up; And the humble person he will save.	18
ASV	Job	22	30	He will deliver even him that is not innocent: Yea, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of thy hands.	18
ASV	Job	23	1	Then Job answered and said,	18
ASV	Job	23	2	Even to-day is my complaint rebellious: My stroke is heavier than my groaning.	18
ASV	Job	23	3	Oh that I knew where I might find him! That I might come even to his seat!	18
ASV	Job	23	4	I would set my cause in order before him, And fill my mouth with arguments.	18
ASV	Job	23	5	I would know the words which he would answer me, And understand what he would say unto me.	18
ASV	Job	23	6	Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? Nay; but he would give heed unto me.	18
ASV	Job	23	7	There the upright might reason with him; So should I be delivered for ever from my judge.	18
ASV	Job	23	8	Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; And backward, but I cannot perceive him;	18
ASV	Job	23	9	On the left hand, when he doth work, but I cannot behold him; He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him.	18
ASV	Job	23	10	But he knoweth the way that I take; When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.	18
ASV	Job	23	11	My foot hath held fast to his steps; His way have I kept, and turned not aside.	18
ASV	Job	23	12	I have not gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.	18
ASV	Job	23	13	But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? And what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.	18
ASV	Job	23	14	For he performeth that which is appointed for me: And many such things are with him.	18
ASV	Job	23	15	Therefore am I terrified at his presence; When I consider, I am afraid of him.	18
ASV	Job	23	16	For God hath made my heart faint, And the Almighty hath terrified me;	18
ASV	Job	23	17	Because I was not cut off before the darkness, Neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.	18
ASV	Job	24	1	Why are times not laid up by the Almighty? And why do not they that know him see his days?	18
ASV	Job	24	2	There are that remove the landmarks; They violently take away flocks, and feed them.	18
ASV	Job	24	3	They drive away the ass of the fatherless; They take the widows ox for a pledge.	18
ASV	Job	24	4	They turn the needy out of the way: The poor of the earth all hide themselves.	18
ASV	Job	24	5	Behold, as wild asses in the desert They go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food; The wilderness yieldeth them bread for their children.	18
ASV	Job	24	6	They cut their provender in the field; And they glean the vintage of the wicked.	18
ASV	Job	24	7	They lie all night naked without clothing, And have no covering in the cold.	18
ASV	Job	24	8	They are wet with the showers of the mountains, And embrace the rock for want of a shelter.	18
ASV	Job	24	9	There are that pluck the fatherless from the breast, And take a pledge of the poor;	18
ASV	Job	24	10	So that they go about naked without clothing, And being hungry they carry the sheaves.	18
ASV	Job	24	11	They make oil within the walls of these men; They tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.	18
ASV	Job	24	12	From out of the populous city men groan, And the soul of the wounded crieth out: Yet God regardeth not the folly.	18
ASV	Job	24	13	These are of them that rebel against the light; They know not the ways thereof, Nor abide in the paths thereof.	18
ASV	Job	24	14	The murderer riseth with the light; He killeth the poor and needy; And in the night he is as a thief.	18
ASV	Job	24	15	The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, Saying, No eye shall see me: And he disguiseth his face.	18
ASV	Job	24	16	In the dark they dig through houses: They shut themselves up in the day-time; They know not the light.	18
ASV	Job	24	17	For the morning is to all of them as thick darkness; For they know the terrors of the thick darkness.	18
ASV	Job	24	18	Swiftly they pass away upon the face of the waters; Their portion is cursed in the earth: They turn not into the way of the vineyards.	18
ASV	Job	24	19	Drought and heat consume the snow waters: So doth Sheol those that have sinned.	18
ASV	Job	24	20	The womb shall forget him; The worm shall feed sweetly on him; He shall be no more remembered; And unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree.	18
ASV	Job	24	21	He devoureth the barren that beareth not, And doeth not good to the widow.	18
ASV	Job	24	22	Yet God preserveth the mighty by his power: He riseth up that hath no assurance of life.	18
ASV	Job	24	23	God giveth them to be in security, and they rest thereon; And his eyes are upon their ways.	18
ASV	Job	24	24	They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone; Yea, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all others, And are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain.	18
ASV	Job	24	25	And if it be not so now, who will prove me a liar, And make my speech nothing worth?	18
ASV	Job	25	1	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,	18
ASV	Job	25	2	Dominion and fear are with him; He maketh peace in his high places.	18
ASV	Job	25	3	Is there any number of his armies? And upon whom doth not his light arise?	18
ASV	Job	25	4	How then can man be just with God? Or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?	18
ASV	Job	25	5	Behold, even the moon hath no brightness, And the stars are not pure in his sight:	18
ASV	Job	25	6	How much less man, that is a worm! And the son of man, that is a worm!	18
ASV	Job	26	1	Then Job answered and said,	18
ASV	Job	26	2	How hast thou helped him that is without power! How hast thou saved the arm that hath no strength!	18
ASV	Job	26	3	How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom, And plentifully declared sound knowledge!	18
ASV	Job	26	4	To whom hast thou uttered words? And whose spirit came forth from thee?	18
ASV	Job	26	5	They that are deceased tremble Beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof.	18
ASV	Job	26	6	Sheol is naked before God, And Abaddon hath no covering.	18
ASV	Job	26	7	He stretcheth out the north over empty space, And hangeth the earth upon nothing.	18
ASV	Job	26	8	He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; And the cloud is not rent under them.	18
ASV	Job	26	9	He incloseth the face of his throne, And spreadeth his cloud upon it.	18
ASV	Job	26	10	He hath described a boundary upon the face of the waters, Unto the confines of light and darkness.	18
ASV	Job	26	11	The pillars of heaven tremble And are astonished at his rebuke.	18
ASV	Job	26	12	He stirreth up the sea with his power, And by his understanding he smiteth through Rahab.	18
ASV	Job	26	13	By his Spirit the heavens are garnished; His hand hath pierced the swift serpent.	18
ASV	Job	26	14	Lo, these are but the outskirts of his ways: And how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?	18
ASV	Job	27	1	And Job again took up his parable, and said,	18
ASV	Job	27	2	As God liveth, who hath taken away my right, And the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul:	18
ASV	Job	27	3	(For my life is yet whole in me, And the spirit of God is in my nostrils);	18
ASV	Job	27	4	Surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness, Neither shall my tongue utter deceit.	18
ASV	Job	27	5	Far be it from me that I should justify you: Till I die I will not put away mine integrity from me.	18
ASV	Job	27	6	My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.	18
ASV	Job	27	7	Let mine enemy be as the wicked, And let him that riseth up against me be as the unrighteous.	18
ASV	Job	27	8	For what is the hope of the godless, though he get him gain, When God taketh away his soul?	18
ASV	Job	27	9	Will God hear his cry, When trouble cometh upon him?	18
ASV	Job	27	10	Will he delight himself in the Almighty, And call upon God at all times?	18
ASV	Job	27	11	I will teach you concerning the hand of God; That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.	18
ASV	Job	27	12	Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; Why then are ye become altogether vain?	18
ASV	Job	27	13	This is the portion of a wicked man with God, And the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty:	18
ASV	Job	27	14	If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword; And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.	18
ASV	Job	27	15	Those that remain of him shall be buried in death, And his widows shall make no lamentation.	18
ASV	Job	27	16	Though he heap up silver as the dust, And prepare raiment as the clay;	18
ASV	Job	27	17	He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, And the innocent shall divide the silver.	18
ASV	Job	27	18	He buildeth his house as the moth, And as a booth which the keeper maketh.	18
ASV	Job	27	19	He lieth down rich, but he shall not be gathered to his fathers; He openeth his eyes, and he is not.	18
ASV	Job	27	20	Terrors overtake him like waters; A tempest stealeth him away in the night.	18
ASV	Job	27	21	The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth; And it sweepeth him out of his place.	18
ASV	Job	27	22	For God shall hurl at him, and not spare: He would fain flee out of his hand.	18
ASV	Job	27	23	Men shall clap their hands at him, And shall hiss him out of his place.	18
ASV	Job	28	1	Surely there is a mine for silver, And a place for gold which they refine.	18
ASV	Job	28	2	Iron is taken out of the earth, And copper is molten out of the stone.	18
ASV	Job	28	3	Man setteth an end to darkness, And searcheth out, to the furthest bound, The stones of obscurity and of thick darkness.	18
ASV	Job	28	4	He breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn; They are forgotten of the foot; They hang afar from men, they swing to and fro.	18
ASV	Job	28	5	As for the earth, out of it cometh bread; And underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.	18
ASV	Job	28	6	The stones thereof are the place of sapphires, And it hath dust of gold.	18
ASV	Job	28	7	That path no bird of prey knoweth, Neither hath the falcons eye seen it:	18
ASV	Job	28	8	The proud beasts have not trodden it, Nor hath the fierce lion passed thereby.	18
ASV	Job	28	9	He putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock; He overturneth the mountains by the roots.	18
ASV	Job	28	10	He cutteth out channels among the rocks; And his eye seeth every precious thing.	18
ASV	Job	28	11	He bindeth the streams that they trickle not; And the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.	18
ASV	Job	28	12	But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?	18
ASV	Job	28	13	Man knoweth not the price thereof; Neither is it found in the land of the living.	18
ASV	Job	28	14	The deep saith, It is not in me; And the sea saith, It is not with me.	18
ASV	Job	28	15	It cannot be gotten for gold, Neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.	18
ASV	Job	28	16	It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, With the precious onyx, or the sapphire.	18
ASV	Job	28	17	Gold and glass cannot equal it, Neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.	18
ASV	Job	28	18	No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal: Yea, the price of wisdom is above rubies.	18
ASV	Job	28	19	The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, Neither shall it be valued with pure gold.	18
ASV	Job	28	20	Whence then cometh wisdom? And where is the place of understanding?	18
ASV	Job	28	21	Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, And kept close from the birds of the heavens.	18
ASV	Job	28	22	Destruction and Death say, We have heard a rumor thereof with our ears.	18
ASV	Job	28	23	God understandeth the way thereof, And he knoweth the place thereof.	18
ASV	Job	28	24	For he looketh to the ends of the earth, And seeth under the whole heaven;	18
ASV	Job	28	25	To make a weight for the wind: Yea, he meteth out the waters by measure.	18
ASV	Job	28	26	When he made a decree for the rain, And a way for the lightning of the thunder;	18
ASV	Job	28	27	Then did he see it, and declare it; He established it, yea, and searched it out.	18
ASV	Job	28	28	And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; And to depart from evil is understanding.	18
ASV	Job	29	1	And Job again took up his parable, and said,	18
ASV	Job	29	2	Oh that I were as in the months of old, As in the days when God watched over me;	18
ASV	Job	29	3	When his lamp shined upon my head, And by his light I walked through darkness;	18
ASV	Job	29	4	As I was in the ripeness of my days, When the friendship of God was upon my tent;	18
ASV	Job	29	5	When the Almighty was yet with me, And my children were about me;	18
ASV	Job	29	6	When my steps were washed with butter, And the rock poured me out streams of oil!	18
ASV	Job	29	7	When I went forth to the gate unto the city, When I prepared my seat in the street,	18
ASV	Job	29	8	The young men saw me and hid themselves, And the aged rose up and stood;	18
ASV	Job	29	9	The princes refrained from talking, And laid their hand on their mouth;	18
ASV	Job	29	10	The voice of the nobles was hushed, And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.	18
ASV	Job	29	11	For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me; And when the eye saw me, it gave witness unto me:	18
ASV	Job	29	12	Because I delivered the poor that cried, The fatherless also, that had none to help him.	18
ASV	Job	29	13	The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me; And I caused the widows heart to sing for joy.	18
ASV	Job	29	14	I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: My justice was as a robe and a diadem.	18
ASV	Job	29	15	I was eyes to the blind, And feet was I to the lame.	18
ASV	Job	29	16	I was a father to the needy: And the cause of him that I knew not I searched out.	18
ASV	Job	29	17	And I brake the jaws of the unrighteous, And plucked the prey out of his teeth.	18
ASV	Job	29	18	Then I said, I shall die in my nest, And I shall multiply my days as the sand:	18
ASV	Job	29	19	My root is spread out to the waters, And the dew lieth all night upon my branch;	18
ASV	Job	29	20	My glory is fresh in me, And my bow is renewed in my hand.	18
ASV	Job	29	21	Unto me men gave ear, and waited, And kept silence for my counsel.	18
ASV	Job	29	22	After my words they spake not again; And my speech distilled upon them.	18
ASV	Job	29	23	And they waited for me as for the rain; And they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.	18
ASV	Job	29	24	I smiled on them, when they had no confidence; And the light of my countenance they cast not down.	18
ASV	Job	29	25	I chose out their way, and sat as chief, And dwelt as a king in the army, As one that comforteth the mourners.	18
ASV	Job	30	1	But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, Whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.	18
ASV	Job	30	2	Yea, the strength of their hands, whereto should it profit me? Men in whom ripe age is perished.	18
ASV	Job	30	3	They are gaunt with want and famine; They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of wasteness and desolation.	18
ASV	Job	30	4	They pluck salt-wort by the bushes; And the roots of the broom are their food.	18
ASV	Job	30	5	They are driven forth from the midst of men; They cry after them as after a thief;	18
ASV	Job	30	6	So that they dwell in frightful valleys, In holes of the earth and of the rocks.	18
ASV	Job	30	7	Among the bushes they bray; Under the nettles they are gathered together.	18
ASV	Job	30	8	They are children of fools, yea, children of base men; They were scourged out of the land.	18
ASV	Job	30	9	And now I am become their song, Yea, I am a byword unto them.	18
ASV	Job	30	10	They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, And spare not to spit in my face.	18
ASV	Job	30	11	For he hath loosed his cord, and afflicted me; And they have cast off the bridle before me.	18
ASV	Job	30	12	Upon my right hand rise the rabble; They thrust aside my feet, And they cast up against me their ways of destruction.	18
ASV	Job	30	13	They mar my path, They set forward my calamity, Even men that have no helper.	18
ASV	Job	30	14	As through a wide breach they come: In the midst of the ruin they roll themselves upon me.	18
ASV	Job	30	15	Terrors are turned upon me; They chase mine honor as the wind; And my welfare is passed away as a cloud.	18
ASV	Job	30	16	And now my soul is poured out within me; Days of affliction have taken hold upon me.	18
ASV	Job	30	17	In the night season my bones are pierced in me, And the pains that gnaw me take no rest.	18
ASV	Job	30	18	By Gods great force is my garment disfigured; It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.	18
ASV	Job	30	19	He hath cast me into the mire, And I am become like dust and ashes.	18
ASV	Job	30	20	I cry unto thee, and thou dost not answer me: I stand up, and thou gazest at me.	18
ASV	Job	30	21	Thou art turned to be cruel to me; With the might of thy hand thou persecutest me.	18
ASV	Job	30	22	Thou liftest me up to the wind, thou causest me to ride upon it; And thou dissolvest me in the storm.	18
ASV	Job	30	23	For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, And to the house appointed for all living.	18
ASV	Job	30	24	Howbeit doth not one stretch out the hand in his fall? Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?	18
ASV	Job	30	25	Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? Was not my soul grieved for the needy?	18
ASV	Job	30	26	When I looked for good, then evil came; And when I waited for light, there came darkness.	18
ASV	Job	30	27	My heart is troubled, and resteth not; Days of affliction are come upon me.	18
ASV	Job	30	28	I go mourning without the sun: I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.	18
ASV	Job	30	29	I am a brother to jackals, And a companion to ostriches.	18
ASV	Job	30	30	My skin is black, and falleth from me, And my bones are burned with heat.	18
ASV	Job	30	31	Therefore is my harp turned to mourning, And my pipe into the voice of them that weep.	18
ASV	Job	31	1	I made a covenant with mine eyes; How then should I look upon a virgin?	18
ASV	Job	31	2	For what is the portion from God above, And the heritage from the Almighty on high?	18
ASV	Job	31	3	Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, And disaster to the workers of iniquity?	18
ASV	Job	31	4	Doth not he see my ways, And number all my steps?	18
ASV	Job	31	5	If I have walked with falsehood, And my foot hath hasted to deceit;	18
ASV	Job	31	6	(Let me be weighed in an even balance, That God may know mine integrity);	18
ASV	Job	31	7	If my step hath turned out of the way, And my heart walked after mine eyes, And if any spot hath cleaved to my hands:	18
ASV	Job	31	8	Then let me sow, and let another eat; Yea, let the produce of my field be rooted out.	18
ASV	Job	31	9	If my heart hath been enticed unto a woman, And I have laid wait at my neighbors door;	18
ASV	Job	31	10	Then let my wife grind unto another, And let others bow down upon her.	18
ASV	Job	31	11	For that were a heinous crime; Yea, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges:	18
ASV	Job	31	12	For it is a fire that consumeth unto Destruction, And would root out all mine increase.	18
ASV	Job	31	13	If I have despised the cause of my man-servant or of my maid-servant, When they contended with me;	18
ASV	Job	31	14	What then shall I do when God riseth up? And when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?	18
ASV	Job	31	15	Did not he that made me in the womb make him? And did not one fashion us in the womb?	18
ASV	Job	31	16	If I have withheld the poor from their desire, Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,	18
ASV	Job	31	17	Or have eaten my morsel alone, And the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;	18
ASV	Job	31	18	(Nay, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, And her have I guided from my mothers womb);	18
ASV	Job	31	19	If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, Or that the needy had no covering;	18
ASV	Job	31	20	If his loins have not blessed me, And if he hath not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep;	18
ASV	Job	31	21	If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, Because I saw my help in the gate:	18
ASV	Job	31	22	Then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade, And mine arm be broken from the bone.	18
ASV	Job	31	23	For calamity from God is a terror to me, And by reason of his majesty I can do nothing.	18
ASV	Job	31	24	If I have made gold my hope, And have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;	18
ASV	Job	31	25	If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, And because my hand had gotten much;	18
ASV	Job	31	26	If I have beheld the sun when it shined, Or the moon walking in brightness,	18
ASV	Job	31	27	And my heart hath been secretly enticed, And my mouth hath kissed my hand:	18
ASV	Job	31	28	This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges; For I should have denied the God that is above.	18
ASV	Job	31	29	If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, Or lifted up myself when evil found him;	18
ASV	Job	31	30	(Yea, I have not suffered by mouth to sin By asking his life with a curse);	18
ASV	Job	31	31	If the men of my tent have not said, Who can find one that hath not been filled with his meat?	18
ASV	Job	31	32	(The sojourner hath not lodged in the street; But I have opened my doors to the traveller);	18
ASV	Job	31	33	If like Adam I have covered my transgressions, By hiding mine iniquity in my bosom,	18
ASV	Job	31	34	Because I feared the great multitude, And the contempt of families terrified me, So that I kept silence, and went not out of the door-	18
ASV	Job	31	35	Oh that I had one to hear me! (Lo, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me); And that I had the indictment which mine adversary hath written!	18
ASV	Job	31	36	Surely I would carry it upon my shoulder; I would bind it unto me as a crown:	18
ASV	Job	31	37	I would declare unto him the number of my steps; As a prince would I go near unto him.	18
ASV	Job	31	38	If my land crieth out against me, And the furrows thereof weep together;	18
ASV	Job	31	39	If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, Or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:	18
ASV	Job	31	40	Let thistles grow instead of wheat, And cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.	18
ASV	Job	32	1	So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.	18
ASV	Job	32	2	Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.	18
ASV	Job	32	3	Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.	18
ASV	Job	32	4	Now Elihu had waited to speak unto Job, because they were elder than he.	18
ASV	Job	32	5	And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.	18
ASV	Job	32	6	And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; Wherefore I held back, and durst not show you mine opinion.	18
ASV	Job	32	7	I said, Days should speak, And multitude of years should teach wisdom.	18
ASV	Job	32	8	But there is a spirit in man, And the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding.	18
ASV	Job	32	9	It is not the great that are wise, Nor the aged that understand justice.	18
ASV	Job	32	10	Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will show mine opinion.	18
ASV	Job	32	11	Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your reasonings, Whilst ye searched out what to say.	18
ASV	Job	32	12	Yea, I attended unto you, And, behold, there was none that convinced Job, Or that answered his words, among you.	18
ASV	Job	32	13	Beware lest ye say, We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not man:	18
ASV	Job	32	14	For he hath not directed his words against me; Neither will I answer him with your speeches.	18
ASV	Job	32	15	They are amazed, they answer no more: They have not a word to say.	18
ASV	Job	32	16	And shall I wait, because they speak not, Because they stand still, and answer no more?	18
ASV	Job	32	17	I also will answer my part, I also will show mine opinion.	18
ASV	Job	32	18	For I am full of words; The spirit within me constraineth me.	18
ASV	Job	32	19	Behold, my breast is as wine which hath no vent; Like new wine-skins it is ready to burst.	18
ASV	Job	32	20	I will speak, that I may be refreshed; I will open my lips and answer.	18
ASV	Job	32	21	Let me not, I pray you, respect any mans person; Neither will I give flattering titles unto any man.	18
ASV	Job	32	22	For I know not to give flattering titles; Else would my Maker soon take me away.	18
ASV	Job	33	1	Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear my speech, And hearken to all my words.	18
ASV	Job	33	2	Behold now, I have opened my mouth; My tongue hath spoken in my mouth.	18
ASV	Job	33	3	My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart; And that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.	18
ASV	Job	33	4	The Spirit of God hath made me, And the breath of the Almighty giveth me life.	18
ASV	Job	33	5	If thou canst, answer thou me; Set thy words in order before me, stand forth.	18
ASV	Job	33	6	Behold, I am toward God even as thou art: I also am formed out of the clay.	18
ASV	Job	33	7	Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, Neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee.	18
ASV	Job	33	8	Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,	18
ASV	Job	33	9	I am clean, without transgression; I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me:	18
ASV	Job	33	10	Behold, he findeth occasions against me, He counteth me for his enemy:	18
ASV	Job	33	11	He putteth my feet in the stocks, He marketh all my paths.	18
ASV	Job	33	12	Behold, I will answer thee, in this thou art not just; For God is greater than man.	18
ASV	Job	33	13	Why dost thou strive against him, For that he giveth not account of any of his matters?	18
ASV	Job	33	14	For God speaketh once, Yea twice, though man regardeth it not.	18
ASV	Job	33	15	In a dream, in a vision of the night, When deep sleep falleth upon men, In slumberings upon the bed;	18
ASV	Job	33	16	Then he openeth the ears of men, And sealeth their instruction,	18
ASV	Job	33	17	That he may withdraw man from his purpose, And hide pride from man;	18
ASV	Job	33	18	He keepeth back his soul from the pit, And his life from perishing by the sword.	18
ASV	Job	33	19	He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, And with continual strife in his bones;	18
ASV	Job	33	20	So that his life abhorreth bread, And his soul dainty food.	18
ASV	Job	33	21	His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; And his bones that were not seen stick out.	18
ASV	Job	33	22	Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit, And his life to the destroyers.	18
ASV	Job	33	23	If there be with him an angel, An interpreter, one among a thousand, To show unto man what is right for him;	18
ASV	Job	33	24	Then God is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.	18
ASV	Job	33	25	His flesh shall be fresher than a childs; He returneth to the days of his youth.	18
ASV	Job	33	26	He prayeth unto God, and he is favorable unto him, So that he seeth his face with joy: And he restoreth unto man his righteousness.	18
ASV	Job	33	27	He singeth before men, and saith, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, And it profited me not:	18
ASV	Job	33	28	He hath redeemed my soul from going into the pit, And my life shall behold the light.	18
ASV	Job	33	29	Lo, all these things doth God work, Twice, yea thrice, with a man,	18
ASV	Job	33	30	To bring back his soul from the pit, That he may be enlightened with the light of the living.	18
ASV	Job	33	31	Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: Hold thy peace, and I will speak.	18
ASV	Job	33	32	If thou hast anything to say, answer me: Speak, for I desire to justify thee.	18
ASV	Job	33	33	If not, hearken thou unto me: Hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom.	18
ASV	Job	34	1	Moreover Elihu answered and said,	18
ASV	Job	34	2	Hear my words, ye wise men; And give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.	18
ASV	Job	34	3	For the ear trieth words, As the palate tasteth food.	18
ASV	Job	34	4	Let us choose for us that which is right: Let us know among ourselves what is good.	18
ASV	Job	34	5	For Job hath said, I am righteous, And God hath taken away my right:	18
ASV	Job	34	6	Notwithstanding my right I am accounted a liar; My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.	18
ASV	Job	34	7	What man is like Job, Who drinketh up scoffing like water,	18
ASV	Job	34	8	Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, And walketh with wicked men?	18
ASV	Job	34	9	For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing That he should delight himself with God.	18
ASV	Job	34	10	Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.	18
ASV	Job	34	11	For the work of a man will he render unto him, And cause every man to find according to his ways.	18
ASV	Job	34	12	Yea, of a surety, God will not do wickedly, Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.	18
ASV	Job	34	13	Who gave him a charge over the earth? Or who hath disposed the whole world?	18
ASV	Job	34	14	If he set his heart upon himself, If he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;	18
ASV	Job	34	15	All flesh shall perish together, And man shall turn again unto dust.	18
ASV	Job	34	16	If now thou hast understanding, hear this: Hearken to the voice of my words.	18
ASV	Job	34	17	Shall even one that hateth justice govern? And wilt thou condemn him that is righteous and mighty?-	18
ASV	Job	34	18	Him that saith to a king, Thou art vile, Or to nobles, Ye are wicked;	18
ASV	Job	34	19	That respecteth not the persons of princes, Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor; For they all are the work of his hands.	18
ASV	Job	34	20	In a moment they die, even at midnight; The people are shaken and pass away, And the mighty are taken away without hand.	18
ASV	Job	34	21	For his eyes are upon the ways of a man, And he seeth all his goings.	18
ASV	Job	34	22	There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.	18
ASV	Job	34	23	For he needeth not further to consider a man, That he should go before God in judgment.	18
ASV	Job	34	24	He breaketh in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out, And setteth others in their stead.	18
ASV	Job	34	25	Therefore he taketh knowledge of their works; And he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.	18
ASV	Job	34	26	He striketh them as wicked men In the open sight of others;	18
ASV	Job	34	27	Because they turned aside from following him, And would not have regard in any of his ways:	18
ASV	Job	34	28	So that they caused the cry of the poor to come unto him, And he heard the cry of the afflicted.	18
ASV	Job	34	29	When he giveth quietness, who then can condemn? And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? Alike whether it be done unto a nation, or unto a man:	18
ASV	Job	34	30	That the godless man reign not, That there be none to ensnare the people.	18
ASV	Job	34	31	For hath any said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:	18
ASV	Job	34	32	That which I see not teach thou me: If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?	18
ASV	Job	34	33	Shall his recompense be as thou wilt, that thou refusest it? For thou must choose, and not I: Therefore speak what thou knowest.	18
ASV	Job	34	34	Men of understanding will say unto me, Yea, every wise man that heareth me:	18
ASV	Job	34	35	Job speaketh without knowledge, And his words are without wisdom.	18
ASV	Job	34	36	Would that Job were tried unto the end, Because of his answering like wicked men.	18
ASV	Job	34	37	For he addeth rebellion unto his sin; He clappeth his hands among us, And multiplieth his words against God.	18
ASV	Job	35	1	Moreover Elihu answered and said,	18
ASV	Job	35	2	Thinkest thou this to be thy right, Or sayest thou, My righteousness is more than Gods,	18
ASV	Job	35	3	That thou sayest, What advantage will it be unto thee? And, What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?	18
ASV	Job	35	4	I will answer thee, And thy companions with thee.	18
ASV	Job	35	5	Look unto the heavens, and see; And behold the skies, which are higher than thou.	18
ASV	Job	35	6	If thou hast sinned, what effectest thou against him? And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?	18
ASV	Job	35	7	If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? Or what receiveth he of thy hand?	18
ASV	Job	35	8	Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; And thy righteousness may profit a son of man.	18
ASV	Job	35	9	By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.	18
ASV	Job	35	10	But none saith, Where is God my Maker, Who giveth songs in the night,	18
ASV	Job	35	11	Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, And maketh us wiser than the birds of the heavens?	18
ASV	Job	35	12	There they cry, but none giveth answer, Because of the pride of evil men.	18
ASV	Job	35	13	Surely God will not hear an empty cry, Neither will the Almighty regard it.	18
ASV	Job	35	14	How much less when thou sayest thou beholdest him not, The cause is before him, and thou waitest for him!	18
ASV	Job	35	15	But now, because he hath not visited in his anger, Neither doth he greatly regard arrogance;	18
ASV	Job	35	16	Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vanity; He multiplieth words without knowledge.	18
ASV	Job	36	1	Elihu also proceeded, and said,	18
ASV	Job	36	2	Suffer me a little, and I will show thee; For I have yet somewhat to say on Gods behalf.	18
ASV	Job	36	3	I will fetch my knowledge from afar, And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.	18
ASV	Job	36	4	For truly my words are not false: One that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.	18
ASV	Job	36	5	Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: He is mighty in strength of understanding.	18
ASV	Job	36	6	He preserveth not the life of the wicked, But giveth to the afflicted their right.	18
ASV	Job	36	7	He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: But with kings upon the throne He setteth them for ever, and they are exalted.	18
ASV	Job	36	8	And if they be bound in fetters, And be taken in the cords of afflictions;	18
ASV	Job	36	9	Then he showeth them their work, And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.	18
ASV	Job	36	10	He openeth also their ear to instruction, And commandeth that they return from iniquity.	18
ASV	Job	36	11	If they hearken and serve him, They shall spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures.	18
ASV	Job	36	12	But if they hearken not, they shall perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge.	18
ASV	Job	36	13	But they that are godless in heart lay up anger: They cry not for help when he bindeth them.	18
ASV	Job	36	14	They die in youth, And their life perisheth among the unclean.	18
ASV	Job	36	15	He delivereth the afflicted by their affliction, And openeth their ear in oppression.	18
ASV	Job	36	16	Yea, he would have allured thee out of distress Into a broad place, where there is no straitness; And that which is set on thy table would be full of fatness.	18
ASV	Job	36	17	But thou art full of the judgment of the wicked: Judgment and justice take hold on thee.	18
ASV	Job	36	18	For let not wrath stir thee up against chastisements; Neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside.	18
ASV	Job	36	19	Will thy cry avail, that thou be not in distress, Or all the forces of thy strength?	18
ASV	Job	36	20	Desire not the night, When peoples are cut off in their place.	18
ASV	Job	36	21	Take heed, regard not iniquity: For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.	18
ASV	Job	36	22	Behold, God doeth loftily in his power: Who is a teacher like unto him?	18
ASV	Job	36	23	Who hath enjoined him his way? Or who can say, Thou hast wrought unrighteousness?	18
ASV	Job	36	24	Remember that thou magnify his work, Whereof men have sung.	18
ASV	Job	36	25	All men have looked thereon; Man beholdeth it afar off.	18
ASV	Job	36	26	Behold, God is great, and we know him not; The number of his years is unsearchable.	18
ASV	Job	36	27	For he draweth up the drops of water, Which distil in rain from his vapor,	18
ASV	Job	36	28	Which the skies pour down And drop upon man abundantly.	18
ASV	Job	36	29	Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, The thunderings of his pavilion?	18
ASV	Job	36	30	Behold, he spreadeth his light around him; And he covereth the bottom of the sea.	18
ASV	Job	36	31	For by these he judgeth the peoples; He giveth food in abundance.	18
ASV	Job	36	32	He covereth his hands with the lightning, And giveth it a charge that it strike the mark.	18
ASV	Job	36	33	The noise thereof telleth concerning him, The cattle also concerning the storm that cometh up.	18
ASV	Job	37	1	Yea, at this my heart trembleth, And is moved out of its place.	18
ASV	Job	37	2	Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice, And the sound that goeth out of his mouth.	18
ASV	Job	37	3	He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven, And his lightening unto the ends of the earth.	18
ASV	Job	37	4	After it a voice roareth; He thundereth with the voice of his majesty; And he restraineth not the lightnings when his voice is heard.	18
ASV	Job	37	5	God thundereth marvellously with his voice; Great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.	18
ASV	Job	37	6	For he saith to the snow, Fall thou on the earth; Likewise to the shower of rain, And to the showers of his mighty rain.	18
ASV	Job	37	7	He sealeth up the hand of every man, That all men whom he hath made may know it.	18
ASV	Job	37	8	Then the beasts go into coverts, And remain in their dens.	18
ASV	Job	37	9	Out of the chamber of the south cometh the storm, And cold out of the north.	18
ASV	Job	37	10	By the breath of God ice is given; And the breadth of the waters is straitened.	18
ASV	Job	37	11	Yea, he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture; He spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning:	18
ASV	Job	37	12	And it is turned round about by his guidance, That they may do whatsoever he commandeth them Upon the face of the habitable world,	18
ASV	Job	37	13	Whether it be for correction, or for his land, Or for lovingkindness, that he cause it to come.	18
ASV	Job	37	14	Hearken unto this, O Job: Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.	18
ASV	Job	37	15	Dost thou know how God layeth his charge upon them, And causeth the lightning of his cloud to shine?	18
ASV	Job	37	16	Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, The wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?	18
ASV	Job	37	17	How thy garments are warm, When the earth is still by reason of the south wind?	18
ASV	Job	37	18	Canst thou with him spread out the sky, Which is strong as a molten mirror?	18
ASV	Job	37	19	Teach us what we shall say unto him; For we cannot set our speech in order by reason of darkness.	18
ASV	Job	37	20	Shall it be told him that I would speak? Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?	18
ASV	Job	37	21	And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies; But the wind passeth, and cleareth them.	18
ASV	Job	37	22	Out of the north cometh golden splendor: God hath upon him terrible majesty.	18
ASV	Job	37	23	Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out He is excellent in power; And in justice and plenteous righteousness he will not afflict.	18
ASV	Job	37	24	Men do therefore fear him: He regardeth not any that are wise of heart.	18
ASV	Job	38	1	Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,	18
ASV	Job	38	2	Who is this that darkeneth counsel By words without knowledge?	18
ASV	Job	38	3	Gird up now thy loins like a man; For I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.	18
ASV	Job	38	4	Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding.	18
ASV	Job	38	5	Who determined the measures thereof, if thou knowest? Or who stretched the line upon it?	18
ASV	Job	38	6	Whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the corner-stone thereof,	18
ASV	Job	38	7	When the morning stars sang together, And all the sons of God shouted for joy?	18
ASV	Job	38	8	Or who shut up the sea with doors, When it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb;	18
ASV	Job	38	9	When I made clouds the garment thereof, And thick darkness a swaddling-band for it,	18
ASV	Job	38	10	And marked out for it my bound, And set bars and doors,	18
ASV	Job	38	11	And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further; And here shall thy proud waves be stayed?	18
ASV	Job	38	12	Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days began, And caused the dayspring to know its place;	18
ASV	Job	38	13	That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, And the wicked be shaken out of it?	18
ASV	Job	38	14	It is changed as clay under the seal; And all things stand forth as a garment:	18
ASV	Job	38	15	And from the wicked their light is withholden, And the high arm is broken.	18
ASV	Job	38	16	Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? Or hast thou walked in the recesses of the deep?	18
ASV	Job	38	17	Have the gates of death been revealed unto thee? Or hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death?	18
ASV	Job	38	18	Hast thou comprehended the earth in its breadth? Declare, if thou knowest it all.	18
ASV	Job	38	19	Where is the way to the dwelling of light? And as for darkness, where is the place thereof,	18
ASV	Job	38	20	That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, And that thou shouldest discern the paths to the house thereof?	18
ASV	Job	38	21	Doubtless, thou knowest, for thou wast then born, And the number of thy days is great!	18
ASV	Job	38	22	Hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow, Or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,	18
ASV	Job	38	23	Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, Against the day of battle and war?	18
ASV	Job	38	24	By what way is the light parted, Or the east wind scattered upon the earth?	18
ASV	Job	38	25	Who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood, Or the way for the lightning of the thunder;	18
ASV	Job	38	26	To cause it to rain on a land where no man is; On the wilderness, wherein there is no man;	18
ASV	Job	38	27	To satisfy the waste and desolate ground, And to cause the tender grass to spring forth?	18
ASV	Job	38	28	Hath the rain a father? Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?	18
ASV	Job	38	29	Out of whose womb came the ice? And the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?	18
ASV	Job	38	30	The waters hide themselves and become like stone, And the face of the deep is frozen.	18
ASV	Job	38	31	Canst thou bind the cluster of the Pleiades, Or loose the bands of Orion?	18
ASV	Job	38	32	Canst thou lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season? Or canst thou guide the Bear with her train?	18
ASV	Job	38	33	Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens? Canst thou establish the dominion thereof in the earth?	18
ASV	Job	38	34	Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, That abundance of waters may cover thee?	18
ASV	Job	38	35	Canst thou send forth lightnings, that they may go, And say unto thee, Here we are?	18
ASV	Job	38	36	Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who hath given understanding to the mind?	18
ASV	Job	38	37	Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven,	18
ASV	Job	38	38	When the dust runneth into a mass, And the clods cleave fast together?	18
ASV	Job	38	39	Canst thou hunt the prey for the lioness, Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,	18
ASV	Job	38	40	When they couch in their dens, And abide in the covert to lie in wait?	18
ASV	Job	38	41	Who provideth for the raven his prey, When his young ones cry unto God, And wander for lack of food?	18
ASV	Job	39	1	Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? Or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?	18
ASV	Job	39	2	Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?	18
ASV	Job	39	3	They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, They cast out their pains.	18
ASV	Job	39	4	Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field; They go forth, and return not again.	18
ASV	Job	39	5	Who hath sent out the wild ass free? Or who hath loosed the bonds of the swift ass,	18
ASV	Job	39	6	Whose home I have made the wilderness, And the salt land his dwelling-place?	18
ASV	Job	39	7	He scorneth the tumult of the city, Neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver.	18
ASV	Job	39	8	The range of the mountains is his pasture, And he searcheth after every green thing.	18
ASV	Job	39	9	Will the wild-ox be content to serve thee? Or will he abide by thy crib?	18
ASV	Job	39	10	Canst thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow? Or will he harrow the valleys after thee?	18
ASV	Job	39	11	Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? Or wilt thou leave to him thy labor?	18
ASV	Job	39	12	Wilt thou confide in him, that he will bring home thy seed, And gather the grain of thy threshing-floor?	18
ASV	Job	39	13	The wings of the ostrich wave proudly; But are they the pinions and plumage of love?	18
ASV	Job	39	14	For she leaveth her eggs on the earth, And warmeth them in the dust,	18
ASV	Job	39	15	And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, Or that the wild beast may trample them.	18
ASV	Job	39	16	She dealeth hardly with her young ones, as if they were not hers: Though her labor be in vain, she is without fear;	18
ASV	Job	39	17	Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, Neither hath he imparted to her understanding.	18
ASV	Job	39	18	What time she lifteth up herself on high, She scorneth the horse and his rider.	18
ASV	Job	39	19	Hast thou given the horse his might? Hast thou clothed his neck with the quivering mane?	18
ASV	Job	39	20	Hast thou made him to leap as a locust? The glory of his snorting is terrible.	18
ASV	Job	39	21	He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: He goeth out to meet the armed men.	18
ASV	Job	39	22	He mocketh at fear, and is not dismayed; Neither turneth he back from the sword.	18
ASV	Job	39	23	The quiver rattleth against him, The flashing spear and the javelin.	18
ASV	Job	39	24	He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage; Neither believeth he that it is the voice of the trumpet.	18
ASV	Job	39	25	As oft as the trumpet soundeth he saith, Aha! And he smelleth the battle afar off, The thunder of the captains, and the shouting.	18
ASV	Job	39	26	Is it by thy wisdom that the hawk soareth, (And) stretcheth her wings toward the south?	18
ASV	Job	39	27	Is it at thy command that the eagle mounteth up, And maketh her nest on high?	18
ASV	Job	39	28	On the cliff she dwelleth, and maketh her home, Upon the point of the cliff, and the stronghold.	18
ASV	Job	39	29	From thence she spieth out the prey; Her eyes behold it afar off.	18
ASV	Job	39	30	Her young ones also suck up blood: And where the slain are, there is she.	18
ASV	Job	40	1	Moreover Jehovah answered Job, and said,	18
ASV	Job	40	2	Shall he that cavilleth contend with the Almighty? He that argueth with God, let him answer it.	18
ASV	Job	40	3	Then Job answered Jehovah, and said,	18
ASV	Job	40	4	Behold, I am of small account; What shall I answer thee? I lay my hand upon my mouth.	18
ASV	Job	40	5	Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; Yea, twice, but I will proceed no further.	18
ASV	Job	40	6	Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,	18
ASV	Job	40	7	Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.	18
ASV	Job	40	8	Wilt thou even annul my judgment? Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be justified?	18
ASV	Job	40	9	Or hast thou an arm like God? And canst thou thunder with a voice like him?	18
ASV	Job	40	10	Deck thyself now with excellency and dignity; And array thyself with honor and majesty.	18
ASV	Job	40	11	Pour forth the overflowings of thine anger; And look upon every one that is proud, and abase him.	18
ASV	Job	40	12	Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; And tread down the wicked where they stand.	18
ASV	Job	40	13	Hide them in the dust together; Bind their faces in the hidden place.	18
ASV	Job	40	14	Then will I also confess of thee That thine own right hand can save thee.	18
ASV	Job	40	15	Behold now, behemoth, which I made as well as thee; He eateth grass as an ox.	18
ASV	Job	40	16	Lo now, his strength is in his loins, And his force is in the muscles of his belly.	18
ASV	Job	40	17	He moveth his tail like a cedar: The sinews of his thighs are knit together.	18
ASV	Job	40	18	His bones are as tubes of brass; His limbs are like bars of iron.	18
ASV	Job	40	19	He is the chief of the ways of God: He only that made him giveth him his sword.	18
ASV	Job	40	20	Surely the mountains bring him forth food, Where all the beasts of the field do play.	18
ASV	Job	40	21	He lieth under the lotus-trees, In the covert of the reed, and the fen.	18
ASV	Job	40	22	The lotus-trees cover him with their shade; The willows of the brook compass him about.	18
ASV	Job	40	23	Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not; He is confident, though a Jordan swell even to his mouth.	18
ASV	Job	40	24	Shall any take him when he is on the watch, Or pierce through his nose with a snare?	18
ASV	Job	41	1	Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fishhook? Or press down his tongue with a cord?	18
ASV	Job	41	2	Canst thou put a rope into his nose? Or pierce his jaw through with a hook?	18
ASV	Job	41	3	Will he make many supplications unto thee? Or will he speak soft words unto thee?	18
ASV	Job	41	4	Will he make a covenant with thee, That thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever?	18
ASV	Job	41	5	Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?	18
ASV	Job	41	6	Will the bands of fishermen make traffic of him? Will they part him among the merchants?	18
ASV	Job	41	7	Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons, Or his head with fish-spears?	18
ASV	Job	41	8	Lay thy hand upon him; Remember the battle, and do so no more.	18
ASV	Job	41	9	Behold, the hope of him is in vain: Will not one be cast down even at the sight of him?	18
ASV	Job	41	10	None is so fierce that he dare stir him up; Who then is he that can stand before me?	18
ASV	Job	41	11	Who hath first given unto me, that I should repay him? Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.	18
ASV	Job	41	12	I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, Nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.	18
ASV	Job	41	13	Who can strip off his outer garment? Who shall come within his jaws?	18
ASV	Job	41	14	Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth is terror.	18
ASV	Job	41	15	His strong scales are his pride, Shut up together as with a close seal.	18
ASV	Job	41	16	One is so near to another, That no air can come between them.	18
ASV	Job	41	17	They are joined one to another; They stick together, so that they cannot be sundered.	18
ASV	Job	41	18	His sneezings flash forth light, And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.	18
ASV	Job	41	19	Out of his mouth go burning torches, And sparks of fire leap forth.	18
ASV	Job	41	20	Out of his nostrils a smoke goeth, As of a boiling pot and burning rushes.	18
ASV	Job	41	21	His breath kindleth coals, And a flame goeth forth from his mouth.	18
ASV	Job	41	22	In his neck abideth strength, And terror danceth before him.	18
ASV	Job	41	23	The flakes of his flesh are joined together: They are firm upon him; they cannot be moved.	18
ASV	Job	41	24	His heart is as firm as a stone; Yea, firm as the nether millstone.	18
ASV	Job	41	25	When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid: By reason of consternation they are beside themselves.	18
ASV	Job	41	26	If one lay at him with the sword, it cannot avail; Nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.	18
ASV	Job	41	27	He counteth iron as straw, And brass as rotten wood.	18
ASV	Job	41	28	The arrow cannot make him flee: Sling-stones are turned with him into stubble.	18
ASV	Job	41	29	Clubs are counted as stubble: He laugheth at the rushing of the javelin.	18
ASV	Job	41	30	His underparts are like sharp potsherds: He spreadeth as it were a threshing-wain upon the mire.	18
ASV	Job	41	31	He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.	18
ASV	Job	41	32	He maketh a path to shine after him; One would think the deep to be hoary.	18
ASV	Job	41	33	Upon earth there is not his like, That is made without fear.	18
ASV	Job	41	34	He beholdeth everything that is high: He is king over all the sons of pride.	18
ASV	Job	42	1	Then Job answered Jehovah, and said,	18
ASV	Job	42	2	I know that thou canst do all things, And that no purpose of thine can be restrained.	18
ASV	Job	42	3	Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore have I uttered that which I understood not, Things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.	18
ASV	Job	42	4	Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak; I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.	18
ASV	Job	42	5	I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; But now mine eye seeth thee:	18
ASV	Job	42	6	Wherefore I abhor myself, And repent in dust and ashes.	18
ASV	Job	42	7	And it was so, that, after Jehovah had spoken these words unto Job, Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.	18
ASV	Job	42	8	Now therefore, take unto you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you; for him will I accept, that I deal not with you after your folly; for ye have not sp	18
ASV	Job	42	9	So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as Jehovah commanded them: and Jehovah accepted Job.	18
ASV	Job	42	10	And Jehovah turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: and Jehovah gave Job twice as much as he had before.	18
ASV	Job	42	11	Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that Jehovah had brought upon	18
ASV	Job	42	12	So Jehovah blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.	18
ASV	Job	42	13	He had also seven sons and three daughters.	18
ASV	Job	42	14	And he called the name of the first, Jemimah: and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.	18
ASV	Job	42	15	And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.	18
ASV	Job	42	16	And after this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons sons, even four generations.	18
ASV	Job	42	17	So Job died, being old and full of days.	18
ASV	Psalms	1	1	Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, Nor standeth in the way of sinners, Nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers:	19
ASV	Psalms	1	2	But his delight is in the law of Jehovah; And on his law doth he meditate day and night.	19
ASV	Psalms	1	3	And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water, That bringeth forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also doth not wither; And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.	19
ASV	Psalms	1	4	The wicked are not so, But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.	19
ASV	Psalms	1	5	Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.	19
ASV	Psalms	1	6	For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous; But the way of the wicked shall perish.	19
ASV	Psalms	2	1	Why do the nations rage, And the peoples meditate a vain thing?	19
ASV	Psalms	2	2	The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against Jehovah, and against his anointed, saying,	19
ASV	Psalms	2	3	Let us break their bonds asunder, And cast away their cords from us.	19
ASV	Psalms	2	4	He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh: The Lord will have them in derision.	19
ASV	Psalms	2	5	Then will he speak unto them in his wrath, And vex them in his sore displeasure:	19
ASV	Psalms	2	6	Yet I have set my king Upon my holy hill of Zion.	19
ASV	Psalms	2	7	I will tell of the decree: Jehovah said unto me, Thou art my son; This day have I begotten thee.	19
ASV	Psalms	2	8	Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, And the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.	19
ASV	Psalms	2	9	Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potters vessel.	19
ASV	Psalms	2	10	Now therefore be wise, O ye kings: Be instructed, ye judges of the earth.	19
ASV	Psalms	2	11	Serve Jehovah with fear, And rejoice with trembling.	19
ASV	Psalms	2	12	Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, For his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all they that take refuge in him.	19
ASV	Psalms	3	1	Jehovah, how are mine adversaries increased! Many are they that rise up against me.	19
ASV	Psalms	3	2	Many there are that say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	3	3	But thou, O Jehovah, art a shield about me; My glory and the lifter up of my head.	19
ASV	Psalms	3	4	I cry unto Jehovah with my voice, And he answereth me out of his holy hill. Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	3	5	I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for Jehovah sustaineth me.	19
ASV	Psalms	3	6	I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people That have set themselves against me round about.	19
ASV	Psalms	3	7	Arise, O Jehovah; save me, O my God: For thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked.	19
ASV	Psalms	3	8	Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah: Thy blessing be upon thy people. Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	4	1	Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness; Thou hast set me at large when I was in distress: Have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.	19
ASV	Psalms	4	2	O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor? How long will ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	4	3	But know that Jehovah hath set apart for himself him that is godly: Jehovah will hear when I call unto him.	19
ASV	Psalms	4	4	Stand in awe, and sin not: Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	4	5	Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, And put your trust in Jehovah.	19
ASV	Psalms	4	6	Many there are that say, Who will show us any good? Jehovah, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.	19
ASV	Psalms	4	7	Thou hast put gladness in my heart, More than they have when their grain and their new wine are increased.	19
ASV	Psalms	4	8	In peace will I both lay me down and sleep; For thou, Jehovah, alone makest me dwell in safety.	19
ASV	Psalms	5	1	Give ear to my words, O Jehovah, Consider my meditation.	19
ASV	Psalms	5	2	Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God; For unto thee do I pray.	19
ASV	Psalms	5	3	O Jehovah, in the morning shalt thou hear my voice; In the morning will I order my prayer unto thee, and will keep watch.	19
ASV	Psalms	5	4	For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: Evil shall not sojourn with thee.	19
ASV	Psalms	5	5	The arrogant shall not stand in thy sight: Thou hatest all workers of iniquity.	19
ASV	Psalms	5	6	Thou wilt destroy them that speak lies: Jehovah abhorreth the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.	19
ASV	Psalms	5	7	But as for me, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness will I come into thy house: In thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.	19
ASV	Psalms	5	8	Lead me, O Jehovah, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; Make thy way straight before my face.	19
ASV	Psalms	5	9	For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; Their inward part is very wickedness; Their throat is an open sepulchre; They flatter with their tongue.	19
ASV	Psalms	5	10	Hold them guilty, O God; Let them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions; For they have rebelled against thee.	19
ASV	Psalms	5	11	But let all those that take refuge in thee rejoice, Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.	19
ASV	Psalms	5	12	For thou wilt bless the righteous; O Jehovah, thou wilt compass him with favor as with a shield.	19
ASV	Psalms	6	1	O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thine anger, Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.	19
ASV	Psalms	6	2	Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; for I am withered away: O Jehovah, heal me; for my bones are troubled.	19
ASV	Psalms	6	3	My soul also is sore troubled: And thou, O Jehovah, how long?	19
ASV	Psalms	6	4	Return, O Jehovah, deliver my soul: Save me for thy lovingkindness sake.	19
ASV	Psalms	6	5	For in death there is no remembrance of thee: In Sheol who shall give thee thanks?	19
ASV	Psalms	6	6	I am weary with my groaning; Every night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.	19
ASV	Psalms	6	7	Mine eye wasteth away because of grief; It waxeth old because of all mine adversaries.	19
ASV	Psalms	6	8	Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; For Jehovah hath heard the voice of my weeping.	19
ASV	Psalms	6	9	Jehovah hath heard my supplication; Jehovah will receive my prayer.	19
ASV	Psalms	6	10	All mine enemies shall be put to shame and sore troubled: They shall turn back, they shall be put to shame suddenly.	19
ASV	Psalms	7	1	O Jehovah my God, in thee do I take refuge: Save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver me,	19
ASV	Psalms	7	2	Lest they tear my soul like a lion, Rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.	19
ASV	Psalms	7	3	O Jehovah my God, if I have done this; If there be iniquity in my hands;	19
ASV	Psalms	7	4	If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (Yea, I have delivered him that without cause was mine adversary;)	19
ASV	Psalms	7	5	Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; Yea, let him tread my life down to the earth, And lay my glory in the dust. Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	7	6	Arise, O Jehovah, in thine anger; Lift up thyself against the rage of mine adversaries, And awake for me; thou hast commanded judgment.	19
ASV	Psalms	7	7	And let the congregation of the peoples compass thee about; And over them return thou on high.	19
ASV	Psalms	7	8	Jehovah ministereth judgment to the peoples: Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and to mine integrity that is in me.	19
ASV	Psalms	7	9	O let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish thou the righteous: For the righteous God trieth the minds and hearts.	19
ASV	Psalms	7	10	My shield is with God, Who saveth the upright in heart.	19
ASV	Psalms	7	11	God is a righteous judge, Yea, a God that hath indignation every day.	19
ASV	Psalms	7	12	If a man turn not, he will whet his sword; He hath bent his bow, and made it ready.	19
ASV	Psalms	7	13	He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; He maketh his arrows fiery shafts.	19
ASV	Psalms	7	14	Behold, he travaileth with iniquity; Yea, he hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.	19
ASV	Psalms	7	15	He hath made a pit, and digged it, And is fallen into the ditch which he made.	19
ASV	Psalms	7	16	His mischief shall return upon his own head, And his violence shall come down upon his own pate.	19
ASV	Psalms	7	17	I will give thanks unto Jehovah according to his righteousness, And will sing praise to the name of Jehovah Most High.	19
ASV	Psalms	8	1	O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth, Who hast set thy glory upon the heavens!	19
ASV	Psalms	8	2	Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou established strength, Because of thine adversaries, That thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.	19
ASV	Psalms	8	3	When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;	19
ASV	Psalms	8	4	What is man, that thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that thou visitest him?	19
ASV	Psalms	8	5	For thou hast made him but little lower than God, And crownest him with glory and honor.	19
ASV	Psalms	8	6	Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet:	19
ASV	Psalms	8	7	All sheep and oxen, Yea, and the beasts of the field,	19
ASV	Psalms	8	8	The birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, Whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.	19
ASV	Psalms	8	9	O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth!	19
ASV	Psalms	9	1	I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart; I will show forth all thy marvellous works.	19
ASV	Psalms	9	2	I will be glad and exult in thee; I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High.	19
ASV	Psalms	9	3	When mine enemies turn back, They stumble and perish at thy presence.	19
ASV	Psalms	9	4	For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; Thou sittest in the throne judging righteously.	19
ASV	Psalms	9	5	Thou hast rebuked the nations, thou hast destroyed the wicked; Thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.	19
ASV	Psalms	9	6	The enemy are come to an end, they are desolate for ever; And the cities which thou hast overthrown, The very remembrance of them is perished.	19
ASV	Psalms	9	7	But Jehovah sitteth as king for ever: He hath prepared his throne for judgment;	19
ASV	Psalms	9	8	And he will judge the world in righteousness, He will minister judgment to the peoples in uprightness.	19
ASV	Psalms	9	9	Jehovah also will be a high tower for the oppressed, A high tower in times of trouble;	19
ASV	Psalms	9	10	And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; For thou, Jehovah, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.	19
ASV	Psalms	9	11	Sing praises to Jehovah, who dwelleth in Zion: Declare among the people his doings.	19
ASV	Psalms	9	12	For he that maketh inquisition for blood remembereth them; He forgetteth not the cry of the poor.	19
ASV	Psalms	9	13	Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; Behold my affliction which I suffer of them that hate me, Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death;	19
ASV	Psalms	9	14	That I may show forth all thy praise. In the gates of the daughter of Zion I will rejoice in thy salvation.	19
ASV	Psalms	9	15	The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made: In the net which they hid is their own foot taken.	19
ASV	Psalms	9	16	Jehovah hath made himself known, he hath executed judgment: The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	9	17	The wicked shall be turned back unto Sheol, Even all the nations that forget God.	19
ASV	Psalms	9	18	For the needy shall not alway be forgotten, Nor the expectation of the poor perish for ever.	19
ASV	Psalms	9	19	Arise, O Jehovah; let not man prevail: Let the nations be judged in thy sight.	19
ASV	Psalms	9	20	Put them in fear, O Jehovah: Let the nations know themselves to be but men. Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	10	1	Why standest thou afar off, O Jehovah? Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?	19
ASV	Psalms	10	2	In the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued; Let them be taken in the devices that they have conceived.	19
ASV	Psalms	10	3	For the wicked boasteth of his hearts desire, And the covetous renounceth, yea, contemneth Jehovah.	19
ASV	Psalms	10	4	The wicked, in the pride of his countenance, saith, He will not require it. All his thoughts are, There is no God.	19
ASV	Psalms	10	5	His ways are firm at all times; Thy judgments are far above out of his sight: As for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them.	19
ASV	Psalms	10	6	He saith in his heart, I shall not be moved; To all generations I shall not be in adversity.	19
ASV	Psalms	10	7	His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression: Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.	19
ASV	Psalms	10	8	He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages; In the secret places doth he murder the innocent; His eyes are privily set against the helpless.	19
ASV	Psalms	10	9	He lurketh in secret as a lion in his covert; He lieth in wait to catch the poor: He doth catch the poor, when he draweth him in his net.	19

ASV	Psalms	38	1	O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thy wrath; Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.	19
ASV	Psalms	38	2	For thine arrows stick fast in me, And thy hand presseth me sore.	19
ASV	Psalms	38	3	There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine indignation; Neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.	19
ASV	Psalms	38	4	For mine iniquities are gone over my head: As a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.	19
ASV	Psalms	38	5	My wounds are loathsome and corrupt, Because of my foolishness.	19
ASV	Psalms	38	6	I am pained and bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.	19
ASV	Psalms	38	7	For my loins are filled with burning; And there is no soundness in my flesh.	19
ASV	Psalms	38	8	I am faint and sore bruised: I have groaned by reason of the disquietness of my heart.	19
ASV	Psalms	38	9	Lord, all my desire is before thee; And my groaning is not hid from thee.	19
ASV	Psalms	38	10	My heart throbbeth, my strength faileth me: As for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.	19
ASV	Psalms	38	11	My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague; And my kinsmen stand afar off.	19
ASV	Psalms	38	12	They also that seek after my life lay snares for me; And they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, And meditate deceits all the day long.	19
ASV	Psalms	38	13	But I, as a deaf man, hear not; And I am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.	19

ASV	Psalms	39	2	I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; And my sorrow was stirred.	19
ASV	Psalms	39	3	My heart was hot within me; While I was musing the fire burned: Then spake I with my tongue:	19
ASV	Psalms	39	4	Jehovah, make me to know mine end, And the measure of my days, what it is; Let me know how frail I am.	19
ASV	Psalms	39	5	Behold, thou hast made my days as handbreadths; And my life-time is as nothing before thee: Surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity. Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	39	6	Surely every man walketh in a vain show; Surely they are disquieted in vain: He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.	19
ASV	Psalms	39	7	And now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope is in thee.	19
ASV	Psalms	39	8	Deliver me from all my transgressions: Make me not the reproach of the foolish.	19

ASV	Psalms	40	1	I waited patiently for Jehovah; And he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.	19

ASV	Psalms	40	5	Many, O Jehovah my God, are the wonderful works which thou hast done, And thy thoughts which are to us-ward; They cannot be set in order unto thee; If I would declare and speak of them, They are more than can be numbered.	19
ASV	Psalms	40	6	Sacrifice and offering thou hast no delight in; Mine ears hast thou opened: Burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not required.	19

ASV	Psalms	40	13	Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me: Make haste to help me, O Jehovah.	19

ASV	Psalms	44	2	Thou didst drive out the nations with thy hand; But them thou didst plant: Thou didst afflict the peoples; But them thou didst spread abroad.	19
ASV	Psalms	44	3	For they gat not the land in possession by their own sword, Neither did their own arm save them; But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, Because thou wast favorable unto them.	19
ASV	Psalms	44	4	Thou art my King, O God: Command deliverance for Jacob.	19
ASV	Psalms	44	5	Through thee will we push down our adversaries: Through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.	19
ASV	Psalms	44	6	For I will not trust in my bow, Neither shall my sword save me.	19
ASV	Psalms	44	7	But thou hast saved us from our adversaries, And hast put them to shame that hate us.	19

ASV	Psalms	44	15	All the day long is my dishonor before me, And the shame of my face hath covered me,	19
ASV	Psalms	44	16	For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth, By reason of the enemy and the avenger.	19
ASV	Psalms	44	17	All this is come upon us; Yet have we not forgotten thee, Neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.	19

ASV	Psalms	44	20	If we have forgotten the name of our God, Or spread forth our hands to a strange god;	19

ASV	Psalms	44	26	Rise up for our help, And redeem us for thy lovingkindness sake.	19
ASV	Psalms	45	1	My heart overfloweth with a goodly matter; I speak the things which I have made touching the king: My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.	19
ASV	Psalms	45	2	Thou art fairer than the children of men; Grace is poured into thy lips: Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.	19
ASV	Psalms	45	3	Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one, Thy glory and thy majesty.	19
ASV	Psalms	45	4	And in thy majesty ride on prosperously, Because of truth and meekness and righteousness: And thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.	19
ASV	Psalms	45	5	Thine arrows are sharp; The peoples fall under thee; They are in the heart of the kings enemies.	19
ASV	Psalms	45	6	Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: A sceptre of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom.	19
ASV	Psalms	45	7	Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness: Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee With the oil of gladness above thy fellows.	19
ASV	Psalms	45	8	All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia; Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad.	19
ASV	Psalms	45	9	Kings daughters are among thy honorable women: At thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir.	19
ASV	Psalms	45	10	Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; Forget also thine own people, and thy fathers house:	19
ASV	Psalms	45	11	So will the king desire thy beauty; For he is thy lord; and reverence thou him.	19
ASV	Psalms	45	12	And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; The rich among the people shall entreat thy favor.	19
ASV	Psalms	45	13	The kings daughter within the palace is all glorious: Her clothing is inwrought with gold.	19

ASV	Psalms	46	1	God is our refuge and strength, A very present help in trouble.	19
ASV	Psalms	46	2	Therefore will we not fear, though the earth do change, And though the mountains be shaken into the heart of the seas;	19
ASV	Psalms	46	3	Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, Though the mountains tremble with the swelling thereof. Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	46	4	There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God, The holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.	19
ASV	Psalms	46	5	God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God will help her, and that right early.	19
ASV	Psalms	46	6	The nations raged, the kingdoms were moved: He uttered his voice, the earth melted.	19

ASV	Psalms	48	2	Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, Is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, The city of the great King.	19
ASV	Psalms	48	3	God hath made himself known in her palaces for a refuge.	19
ASV	Psalms	48	4	For, lo, the kings assembled themselves, They passed by together.	19
ASV	Psalms	48	5	They saw it, then were they amazed; They were dismayed, they hasted away.	19
ASV	Psalms	48	6	Trembling took hold of them there, Pain, as of a woman in travail.	19
ASV	Psalms	48	7	With the east wind Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish.	19

ASV	Psalms	49	3	My mouth shall speak wisdom; And the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.	19
ASV	Psalms	49	4	I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.	19
ASV	Psalms	49	5	Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, When iniquity at my heels compasseth me about?	19
ASV	Psalms	49	6	They that trust in their wealth, And boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;	19
ASV	Psalms	49	7	None of them can by any means redeem his brother, Nor give to God a ransom for him;	19
ASV	Psalms	49	8	(For the redemption of their life is costly, And it faileth for ever;)	19
ASV	Psalms	49	9	That he should still live alway, That he should not see corruption.	19

ASV	Psalms	49	16	Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, When the glory of his house is increased.	19
ASV	Psalms	49	17	For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away; His glory shall not descend after him.	19
ASV	Psalms	49	18	Though while he lived he blessed his soul (And men praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself,)	19
ASV	Psalms	49	19	He shall go to the generation of his fathers; They shall never see the light.	19
ASV	Psalms	49	20	Man that is in honor, and understandeth not, Is like the beasts that perish.	19
ASV	Psalms	50	1	The Mighty One, God, Jehovah, hath spoken, And called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.	19
ASV	Psalms	50	2	Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined forth.	19
ASV	Psalms	50	3	Our God cometh, and doth not keep silence: A fire devoureth before him, And it is very tempestuous round about him.	19
ASV	Psalms	50	4	He calleth to the heavens above, And to the earth, that he may judge his people:	19
ASV	Psalms	50	5	Gather my saints together unto me, Those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.	19

ASV	Psalms	50	10	For every beast of the forest is mine, And the cattle upon a thousand hills.	19
ASV	Psalms	50	11	I know all the birds of the mountains; And the wild beasts of the field are mine.	19
ASV	Psalms	50	12	If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; For the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.	19
ASV	Psalms	50	13	Will I eat the flesh of bulls, Or drink the blood of goats?	19
ASV	Psalms	50	14	Offer unto God the sacrifice of thanksgiving; And pay thy vows unto the Most High:	19
ASV	Psalms	50	15	And call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.	19
ASV	Psalms	50	16	But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, And that thou hast taken my covenant in thy mouth,	19
ASV	Psalms	50	17	Seeing thou hatest instruction, And castest my words behind thee?	19
ASV	Psalms	50	18	When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst with him, And hast been partaker with adulterers.	19
ASV	Psalms	50	19	Thou givest thy mouth to evil, And thy tongue frameth deceit.	19
ASV	Psalms	50	20	Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; Thou slanderest thine own mothers son.	19
ASV	Psalms	50	21	These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thyself: But I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.	19
ASV	Psalms	50	22	Now consider this, ye that forget God, Lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver:	19
ASV	Psalms	50	23	Whoso offereth the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifieth me; And to him that ordereth his way aright Will I show the salvation of God.	19

ASV	Psalms	73	1	Surely God is good to Israel, Even to such as are pure in heart.	19
ASV	Psalms	73	2	But as for me, my feet were almost gone; My steps had well nigh slipped.	19
ASV	Psalms	73	3	For I was envious at the arrogant, When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.	19
ASV	Psalms	73	4	For there are no pangs in their death; But their strength is firm.	19
ASV	Psalms	73	5	They are not in trouble as other men; Neither are they plagued like other men.	19
ASV	Psalms	73	6	Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck; Violence covereth them as a garment.	19

ASV	Psalms	73	12	Behold, these are the wicked; And, being alway at ease, they increase in riches.	19
ASV	Psalms	73	13	Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart, And washed my hands in innocency;	19
ASV	Psalms	73	14	For all the day long have I been plagued, And chastened every morning.	19
ASV	Psalms	73	15	If I had said, I will speak thus; Behold, I had dealt treacherously with the generation of thy children.	19
ASV	Psalms	73	16	When I thought how I might know this, It was too painful for me;	19
ASV	Psalms	73	17	Until I went into the sanctuary of God, And considered their latter end.	19
ASV	Psalms	73	18	Surely thou settest them in slippery places: Thou castest them down to destruction.	19
ASV	Psalms	73	19	How are they become a desolation in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors.	19
ASV	Psalms	73	20	As a dream when one awaketh, So, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou wilt despise their image.	19
ASV	Psalms	73	21	For my soul was grieved, And I was pricked in my heart:	19
ASV	Psalms	73	22	So brutish was I, and ignorant; I was as a beast before thee.	19
ASV	Psalms	73	23	Nevertheless I am continually with thee: Thou hast holden my right hand.	19
ASV	Psalms	73	24	Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel, And afterward receive me to glory.	19
ASV	Psalms	73	25	Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.	19
ASV	Psalms	73	26	My flesh and my heart faileth; But God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever.	19
ASV	Psalms	73	27	For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: Thou hast destroyed all them that play the harlot, departing from thee.	19
ASV	Psalms	73	28	But it is good for me to draw near unto God: I have made the Lord Jehovah my refuge, That I may tell of all thy works.	19
ASV	Psalms	74	1	O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? Why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?	19
ASV	Psalms	74	2	Remember thy congregation, which thou hast gotten of old, Which thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of thine inheritance; And mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.	19
ASV	Psalms	74	3	Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual ruins, All the evil that the enemy hath done in the sanctuary.	19
ASV	Psalms	74	4	Thine adversaries have roared in the midst of thine assembly; They have set up their ensigns for signs.	19
ASV	Psalms	74	5	They seemed as men that lifted up Axes upon a thicket of trees.	19
ASV	Psalms	74	6	And now all the carved work thereof They break down with hatchet and hammers.	19
ASV	Psalms	74	7	They have set thy sanctuary on fire; They have profaned the dwelling-place of thy name by casting it to the ground.	19
ASV	Psalms	74	8	They said in their heart, Let us make havoc of them altogether: They have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.	19
ASV	Psalms	74	9	We see not our signs: There is no more any prophet; Neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.	19
ASV	Psalms	74	10	How long, O God, shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?	19
ASV	Psalms	74	11	Why drawest thou back thy hand, even thy right hand? Pluck it out of thy bosom and consume them.	19
ASV	Psalms	74	12	Yet God is my King of old, Working salvation in the midst of the earth.	19
ASV	Psalms	74	13	Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: Thou brakest the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.	19
ASV	Psalms	74	14	Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces; Thou gavest him to be food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.	19
ASV	Psalms	74	15	Thou didst cleave fountain and flood: Thou driedst up mighty rivers.	19
ASV	Psalms	74	16	The day is thine, the night also is thine: Thou hast prepared the light and the sun.	19
ASV	Psalms	74	17	Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: Thou hast made summer and winter.	19
ASV	Psalms	74	18	Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O Jehovah, And that a foolish people hath blasphemed thy name.	19
ASV	Psalms	74	19	Oh deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the wild beast: Forget not the life of thy poor for ever.	19
ASV	Psalms	74	20	Have respect unto the covenant; For the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence.	19
ASV	Psalms	74	21	Oh let not the oppressed return ashamed: Let the poor and needy praise thy name.	19
ASV	Psalms	74	22	Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: Remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee all the day.	19
ASV	Psalms	74	23	Forget not the voice of thine adversaries: The tumult of those that rise up against thee ascendeth continually.	19
ASV	Psalms	75	1	We give thanks unto thee, O God; We give thanks, for thy name is near: Men tell of thy wondrous works.	19
ASV	Psalms	75	2	When I shall find the set time, I will judge uprightly.	19
ASV	Psalms	75	3	The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I have set up the pillars of it. Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	75	4	I said unto the arrogant, Deal not arrogantly; And to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:	19
ASV	Psalms	75	5	Lift not up your horn on high; Speak not with a stiff neck.	19
ASV	Psalms	75	6	For neither from the east, nor from the west, Nor yet from the south, cometh lifting up.	19
ASV	Psalms	75	7	But God is the judge: He putteth down one, and lifteth up another.	19
ASV	Psalms	75	8	For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and the wine foameth; It is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the same: Surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall drain them, and drink them.	19
ASV	Psalms	75	9	But I will declare for ever, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.	19
ASV	Psalms	75	10	All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; But the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.	19
ASV	Psalms	76	1	In Judah is God known: His name is great in Israel.	19
ASV	Psalms	76	2	In Salem also is his tabernacle, And his dwelling-place in Zion.	19
ASV	Psalms	76	3	There he brake the arrows of the bow; The shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	76	4	Glorious art thou and excellent, From the mountains of prey.	19
ASV	Psalms	76	5	The stouthearted are made a spoil, They have slept their sleep; And none of the men of might have found their hands.	19
ASV	Psalms	76	6	At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep.	19
ASV	Psalms	76	7	Thou, even thou, art to be feared; And who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?	19
ASV	Psalms	76	8	Thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven; The earth feared, and was still,	19
ASV	Psalms	76	9	When God arose to judgment, To save all the meek of the earth. Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	76	10	Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: The residue of wrath shalt thou gird upon thee.	19
ASV	Psalms	76	11	Vow, and pay unto Jehovah your God: Let all that are round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.	19
ASV	Psalms	76	12	He will cut off the spirit of princes: He is terrible to the kings of the earth.	19
ASV	Psalms	77	1	I will cry unto God with my voice, Even unto God with my voice; and he will give ear unto me.	19
ASV	Psalms	77	2	In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: My hand was stretched out in the night, and slacked not; My soul refused to be comforted.	19
ASV	Psalms	77	3	I remember God, and am disquieted: I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	77	4	Thou holdest mine eyes watching: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.	19
ASV	Psalms	77	5	I have considered the days of old, The years of ancient times.	19
ASV	Psalms	77	6	I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart; And my spirit maketh diligent search.	19
ASV	Psalms	77	7	Will the Lord cast off for ever? And will he be favorable no more?	19
ASV	Psalms	77	8	Is his lovingkindness clean gone for ever? Doth his promise fail for evermore?	19
ASV	Psalms	77	9	Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	77	10	And I said, This is my infirmity; But I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High.	19
ASV	Psalms	77	11	I will make mention of the deeds of Jehovah; For I will remember thy wonders of old.	19
ASV	Psalms	77	12	I will meditate also upon all thy work, And muse on thy doings.	19
ASV	Psalms	77	13	Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: Who is a great god like unto God?	19
ASV	Psalms	77	14	Thou art the God that doest wonders: Thou hast made known thy strength among the peoples.	19
ASV	Psalms	77	15	Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	77	16	The waters saw thee, O God; The waters saw thee, they were afraid: The depths also trembled.	19
ASV	Psalms	77	17	The clouds poured out water; The skies sent out a sound: Thine arrows also went abroad.	19
ASV	Psalms	77	18	The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind; The lightnings lightened the world: The earth trembled and shook.	19
ASV	Psalms	77	19	Thy way was in the sea, And thy paths in the great waters, And thy footsteps were not known.	19
ASV	Psalms	77	20	Thou leddest thy people like a flock, By the hand of Moses and Aaron.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	1	Give ear, O my people, to my law: Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	2	I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings of old,	19
ASV	Psalms	78	3	Which we have heard and known, And our fathers have told us.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	4	We will not hide them from their children, Telling to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah, And his strength, and his wondrous works that he hath done.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	5	For he established a testimony in Jacob, And appointed a law in Israel, Which he commanded our fathers, That they should make them known to their children;	19
ASV	Psalms	78	6	That the generation to come might know them, even the children that should be born; Who should arise and tell them to their children,	19
ASV	Psalms	78	7	That they might set their hope in God, And not forget the works of God, But keep his commandments,	19
ASV	Psalms	78	8	And might not be as their fathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation that set not their heart aright, And whose spirit was not stedfast with God.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	9	The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, Turned back in the day of battle.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	10	They kept not the covenant of God, And refused to walk in his law;	19
ASV	Psalms	78	11	And they forgat his doings, And his wondrous works that he had showed them.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	12	Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	13	He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through; And he made the waters to stand as a heap.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	14	In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, And all the night with a light of fire.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	15	He clave rocks in the wilderness, And gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	16	He brought streams also out of the rock, And caused waters to run down like rivers.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	17	Yet went they on still to sin against him, To rebel against the Most High in the desert.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	18	And they tempted God in their heart By asking food according to their desire.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	19	Yea, they spake against God; They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?	19
ASV	Psalms	78	20	Behold, he smote the rock, so that waters gushed out, And streams overflowed; Can he give bread also? Will he provide flesh for his people?	19
ASV	Psalms	78	21	Therefore Jehovah heard, and was wroth; And a fire was kindled against Jacob, And anger also went up against Israel;	19
ASV	Psalms	78	22	Because they believed not in God, And trusted not in his salvation.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	23	Yet he commanded the skies above, And opened the doors of heaven;	19
ASV	Psalms	78	24	And he rained down manna upon them to eat, And gave them food from heaven.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	25	Man did eat the bread of the mighty: He sent them food to the full.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	26	He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens; And by his power he guided the south wind.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	27	He rained flesh also upon them as the dust, And winged birds as the sand of the seas:	19
ASV	Psalms	78	28	And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, Round about their habitations.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	29	So they did eat, and were well filled; And he gave them their own desire.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	30	They were not estranged from that which they desired, Their food was yet in their mouths,	19
ASV	Psalms	78	31	When the anger of God went up against them, And slew of the fattest of them, And smote down the young men of Israel.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	32	For all this they sinned still, And believed not in his wondrous works.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	33	Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, And their years in terror.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	34	When he slew them, then they inquired after him; And they returned and sought God earnestly.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	35	And they remembered that God was their rock, And the Most High God their redeemer.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	36	But they flattered him with their mouth, And lied unto him with their tongue.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	37	For their heart was not right with him, Neither were they faithful in his covenant.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	38	But he, being merciful, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: Yea, many a time turned he his anger away, And did not stir up all his wrath.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	39	And he remembered that they were but flesh, A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	40	How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness, And grieve him in the desert!	19
ASV	Psalms	78	41	And they turned again and tempted God, And provoked the Holy One of Israel.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	42	They remember not his hand, Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;	19
ASV	Psalms	78	43	How he set his signs in Egypt, And his wonders in the field of Zoan,	19
ASV	Psalms	78	44	And turned their rivers into blood, And their streams, so that they could not drink.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	45	He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; And frogs, which destroyed them.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	46	He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, And their labor unto the locust.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	47	He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycomore-trees with frost.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	48	He gave over their cattle also to the hail, And their flocks to hot thunderbolts.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	49	He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, Wrath, and indignation, and trouble, A band of angels of evil.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	50	He made a path for his anger; He spared not their soul from death, But gave their life over to the pestilence,	19
ASV	Psalms	78	51	And smote all the first-born in Egypt, The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	52	But he led forth his own people like sheep, And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	53	And he led them safely, so that they feared not; But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	54	And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, To this mountain, which his right hand had gotten.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	55	He drove out the nations also before them, And allotted them for an inheritance by line, And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	56	Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, And kept not his testimonies;	19
ASV	Psalms	78	57	But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers: They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	58	For they provoked him to anger with their high places, And moved him to jealousy with their graven images.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	59	When God heard this, he was wroth, And greatly abhorred Israel;	19
ASV	Psalms	78	60	So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, The tent which he placed among men;	19
ASV	Psalms	78	61	And delivered his strength into captivity, And his glory into the adversarys hand.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	62	He gave his people over also unto the sword, And was wroth with his inheritance.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	63	Fire devoured their young men; And their virgins had no marriage-song.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	64	Their priests fell by the sword; And their widows made no lamentation.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	65	Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, Like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	66	And he smote his adversaries backward: He put them to a perpetual reproach.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	67	Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph, And chose not the tribe of Ephraim,	19
ASV	Psalms	78	68	But chose the tribe of Judah, The mount Zion which he loved.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	69	And he built his sanctuary like the heights, Like the earth which he hath established for ever.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	70	He chose David also his servant, And took him from the sheepfolds:	19
ASV	Psalms	78	71	From following the ewes that have their young he brought him, To be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.	19
ASV	Psalms	78	72	So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, And guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.	19
ASV	Psalms	79	1	O God, the nations are come into thine inheritance; Thy holy temple have they defiled; They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.	19
ASV	Psalms	79	2	The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be food unto the birds of the heavens, The flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.	19
ASV	Psalms	79	3	Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; And there was none to bury them.	19
ASV	Psalms	79	4	We are become a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and derision to them that are round about us.	19
ASV	Psalms	79	5	How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou be angry for ever? Shall thy jealousy burn like fire?	19
ASV	Psalms	79	6	Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, And upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name.	19
ASV	Psalms	79	7	For they have devoured Jacob, And laid waste his habitation.	19
ASV	Psalms	79	8	Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers: Let thy tender mercies speedily meet us; For we are brought very low.	19
ASV	Psalms	79	9	Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name; And deliver us, and forgive our sins, for thy names sake.	19
ASV	Psalms	79	10	Wherefore should the nations say, Where is their God? Let the avenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed Be known among the nations in our sight.	19
ASV	Psalms	79	11	Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee: According to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to death;	19
ASV	Psalms	79	12	And render unto our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom Their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.	19
ASV	Psalms	79	13	So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture Will give thee thanks for ever: We will show forth thy praise to all generations.	19
ASV	Psalms	80	1	Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; Thou that sittest above the cherubim, shine forth.	19
ASV	Psalms	80	2	Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up thy might, And come to save us.	19
ASV	Psalms	80	3	Turn us again, O God; And cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.	19
ASV	Psalms	80	4	O Jehovah God of hosts, How long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?	19
ASV	Psalms	80	5	Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears, And given them tears to drink in large measure.	19
ASV	Psalms	80	6	Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbors; And our enemies laugh among themselves.	19
ASV	Psalms	80	7	Turn us again, O God of hosts; And cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.	19
ASV	Psalms	80	8	Thou broughtest a vine out of Egypt: Thou didst drive out the nations, and plantedst it.	19
ASV	Psalms	80	9	Thou preparedst room before it, And it took deep root, and filled the land.	19
ASV	Psalms	80	10	The mountains were covered with the shadow of it, And the boughs thereof were like cedars of God.	19
ASV	Psalms	80	11	It sent out its branches unto the sea, And its shoots unto the River.	19
ASV	Psalms	80	12	Why hast thou broken down its walls, So that all they that pass by the way do pluck it?	19
ASV	Psalms	80	13	The boar out of the wood doth ravage it, And the wild beasts of the field feed on it.	19
ASV	Psalms	80	14	Turn again, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: Look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine,	19
ASV	Psalms	80	15	And the stock which thy right hand planted, And the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.	19
ASV	Psalms	80	16	It is burned with fire, it is cut down: They perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.	19
ASV	Psalms	80	17	Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, Upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.	19
ASV	Psalms	80	18	So shall we not go back from thee: Quicken thou us, and we will call upon thy name.	19
ASV	Psalms	80	19	Turn us again, O Jehovah God of hosts; Cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.	19
ASV	Psalms	81	1	Sing aloud unto God our strength: Make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.	19
ASV	Psalms	81	2	Raise a song, and bring hither the timbrel, The pleasant harp with the psaltery.	19
ASV	Psalms	81	3	Blow the trumpet at the new moon, At the full moon, on our feast-day.	19
ASV	Psalms	81	4	For it is a statute for Israel, An ordinance of the God of Jacob.	19
ASV	Psalms	81	5	He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony, When he went out over the land of Egypt, Where I heard a language that I knew not.	19
ASV	Psalms	81	6	I removed his shoulder from the burden: His hands were freed from the basket.	19
ASV	Psalms	81	7	Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	81	8	Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wouldest hearken unto me!	19
ASV	Psalms	81	9	There shall no strange god be in thee; Neither shalt thou worship any foreign god.	19
ASV	Psalms	81	10	I am Jehovah thy God, Who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt: Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.	19
ASV	Psalms	81	11	But my people hearkened not to my voice; And Israel would none of me.	19
ASV	Psalms	81	12	So I let them go after the stubbornness of their heart, That they might walk in their own counsels.	19
ASV	Psalms	81	13	Oh that my people would hearken unto me, That Israel would walk in my ways!	19
ASV	Psalms	81	14	I would soon subdue their enemies, And turn my hand against their adversaries.	19
ASV	Psalms	81	15	The haters of Jehovah should submit themselves unto him: But their time should endure for ever.	19
ASV	Psalms	81	16	He would feed them also with the finest of the wheat; And with honey out of the rock would I satisfy thee.	19
ASV	Psalms	82	1	God standeth in the congregation of God; He judgeth among the gods.	19
ASV	Psalms	82	2	How long will ye judge unjustly, And respect the persons of the wicked? Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	82	3	Judge the poor and fatherless: Do justice to the afflicted and destitute.	19
ASV	Psalms	82	4	Rescue the poor and needy: Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.	19
ASV	Psalms	82	5	They know not, neither do they understand; They walk to and fro in darkness: All the foundations of the earth are shaken.	19
ASV	Psalms	82	6	I said, Ye are gods, And all of you sons of the Most High.	19
ASV	Psalms	82	7	Nevertheless ye shall die like men, And fall like one of the princes.	19
ASV	Psalms	82	8	Arise, O God, judge the earth; For thou shalt inherit all the nations.	19
ASV	Psalms	83	1	O God, keep not thou silence: Hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.	19
ASV	Psalms	83	2	For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult; And they that hate thee have lifted up the head.	19
ASV	Psalms	83	3	Thy take crafty counsel against thy people, And consult together against thy hidden ones.	19
ASV	Psalms	83	4	They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; That the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.	19
ASV	Psalms	83	5	For they have consulted together with one consent; Against thee do they make a covenant:	19
ASV	Psalms	83	6	The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagarenes;	19
ASV	Psalms	83	7	Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre:	19
ASV	Psalms	83	8	Assyria also is joined with them; They have helped the children of Lot. Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	83	9	Do thou unto them as unto Midian, As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;	19
ASV	Psalms	83	10	Who perished at Endor, Who became as dung for the earth.	19
ASV	Psalms	83	11	Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; Yea, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna;	19
ASV	Psalms	83	12	Who said, Let us take to ourselves in possession The habitations of God.	19
ASV	Psalms	83	13	O my God, make them like the whirling dust; As stubble before the wind.	19
ASV	Psalms	83	14	As the fire that burneth the forest, And as the flame that setteth the mountains on fire,	19
ASV	Psalms	83	15	So pursue them with thy tempest, And terrify them with thy storm.	19
ASV	Psalms	83	16	Fill their faces with confusion, That they may seek thy name, O Jehovah.	19
ASV	Psalms	83	17	Let them be put to shame and dismayed for ever; Yea, let them be confounded and perish;	19
ASV	Psalms	83	18	That they may know that thou alone, whose name is Jehovah, Art the Most High over all the earth.	19
ASV	Psalms	84	1	How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Jehovah of hosts!	19
ASV	Psalms	84	2	My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of Jehovah; My heart and my flesh cry out unto the living God.	19
ASV	Psalms	84	3	Yea, the sparrow hath found her a house, And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, Even thine altars, O Jehovah of hosts, My King, and my God.	19
ASV	Psalms	84	4	Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: They will be still praising thee. Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	84	5	Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; In whose heart are the highways to Zion.	19
ASV	Psalms	84	6	Passing through the valley of Weeping they make it a place of springs; Yea, the early rain covereth it with blessings.	19
ASV	Psalms	84	7	They go from strength to strength; Every one of them appeareth before God in Zion.	19
ASV	Psalms	84	8	O Jehovah God of hosts, hear my prayer; Give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	84	9	Behold, O God our shield, And look upon the face of thine anointed.	19
ASV	Psalms	84	10	For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, Than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.	19
ASV	Psalms	84	11	For Jehovah God is a sun and a shield: Jehovah will give grace and glory; No good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.	19
ASV	Psalms	84	12	O Jehovah of hosts, Blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.	19
ASV	Psalms	85	1	Jehovah, thou hast been favorable unto thy land; Thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.	19
ASV	Psalms	85	2	Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people; Thou hast covered all their sin. Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	85	3	Thou hast taken away all thy wrath; Thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger.	19
ASV	Psalms	85	4	Turn us, O God of our salvation, And cause thine indignation toward us to cease.	19
ASV	Psalms	85	5	Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? Wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?	19
ASV	Psalms	85	6	Wilt thou not quicken us again, That thy people may rejoice in thee?	19
ASV	Psalms	85	7	Show us thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, And grant us thy salvation.	19
ASV	Psalms	85	8	I will hear what God Jehovah will speak; For he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: But let them not turn again to folly.	19
ASV	Psalms	85	9	Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him, That glory may dwell in our land.	19
ASV	Psalms	85	10	Mercy and truth are met together; Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.	19
ASV	Psalms	85	11	Truth springeth out of the earth; And righteousness hath looked down from heaven.	19
ASV	Psalms	85	12	Yea, Jehovah will give that which is good; And our land shall yield its increase.	19
ASV	Psalms	85	13	Righteousness shall go before him, And shall make his footsteps a way to walk in.	19
ASV	Psalms	86	1	Bow down thine ear, O Jehovah, and answer me; For I am poor and needy.	19
ASV	Psalms	86	2	Preserve my soul; for I am godly: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.	19
ASV	Psalms	86	3	Be merciful unto me, O Lord; For unto thee do I cry all the day long.	19
ASV	Psalms	86	4	Rejoice the soul of thy servant; For unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.	19
ASV	Psalms	86	5	For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive, And abundant in lovingkindness unto all them that call upon thee.	19
ASV	Psalms	86	6	Give ear, O Jehovah, unto my prayer; And hearken unto the voice of my supplications.	19
ASV	Psalms	86	7	In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee; For thou wilt answer me.	19
ASV	Psalms	86	8	There is none like unto thee among the gods, O Lord; Neither are there any works like unto thy works.	19
ASV	Psalms	86	9	All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; And they shall glorify thy name.	19
ASV	Psalms	86	10	For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: Thou art God alone.	19
ASV	Psalms	86	11	Teach me thy way, O Jehovah; I will walk in thy truth: Unite my heart to fear thy name.	19
ASV	Psalms	86	12	I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart; And I will glorify thy name for evermore.	19
ASV	Psalms	86	13	For great is thy lovingkindness toward me; And thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.	19
ASV	Psalms	86	14	O God, the proud are risen up against me, And a company of violent men have sought after my soul, And have not set thee before them.	19
ASV	Psalms	86	15	But thou, O Lord, art a God merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness and truth.	19
ASV	Psalms	86	16	Oh turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; Give thy strength unto thy servant, And save the son of thy handmaid.	19
ASV	Psalms	86	17	Show me a token for good, That they who hate me may see it, and be put to shame, Because thou, Jehovah, hast helped me, and comforted me.	19
ASV	Psalms	87	1	His foundation is in the holy mountains.	19
ASV	Psalms	87	2	Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion More than all the dwellings of Jacob.	19
ASV	Psalms	87	3	Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	87	4	I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as among them that know me: Behold, Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia: This one was born there.	19
ASV	Psalms	87	5	Yea, of Zion it shall be said, This one and that one was born in her; And the Most High himself will establish her.	19
ASV	Psalms	87	6	Jehovah will count, when he writeth up the peoples, This one was born there. Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	87	7	They that sing as well as they that dance shall say, All my fountains are in thee.	19
ASV	Psalms	88	1	O Jehovah, the God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee.	19
ASV	Psalms	88	2	Let my prayer enter into thy presence; Incline thine ear unto my cry.	19
ASV	Psalms	88	3	For my soul is full of troubles, And my life draweth nigh unto Sheol.	19
ASV	Psalms	88	4	I am reckoned with them that go down into the pit; I am as a man that hath no help,	19
ASV	Psalms	88	5	Cast off among the dead, Like the slain that lie in the grave, Whom thou rememberest no more, And they are cut off from thy hand.	19
ASV	Psalms	88	6	Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, In dark places, in the deeps.	19
ASV	Psalms	88	7	Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, And thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	88	8	Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me; Thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.	19
ASV	Psalms	88	9	Mine eye wasteth away by reason of affliction: I have called daily upon thee, O Jehovah; I have spread forth my hands unto thee.	19
ASV	Psalms	88	10	Wilt thou show wonders to the dead? Shall they that are decreased arise and praise thee? Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	88	11	Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? Or thy faithfulness in Destruction?	19
ASV	Psalms	88	12	Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? And thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?	19
ASV	Psalms	88	13	But unto thee, O Jehovah, have I cried; And in the morning shall my prayer come before thee.	19
ASV	Psalms	88	14	Jehovah, why castest thou off my soul? Why hidest thou thy face from me?	19
ASV	Psalms	88	15	I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: While I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.	19
ASV	Psalms	88	16	Thy fierce wrath is gone over me; Thy terrors have cut me off.	19
ASV	Psalms	88	17	They came round about me like water all the day long; They compassed me about together.	19
ASV	Psalms	88	18	Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, And mine acquaintance into darkness.	19
ASV	Psalms	89	1	I will sing of the lovingkindness of Jehovah for ever: With my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.	19
ASV	Psalms	89	2	For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever; Thy faithfulness wilt thou establish in the very heavens.	19
ASV	Psalms	89	3	I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant:	19
ASV	Psalms	89	4	Thy seed will I establish for ever, And build up thy throne to all generations. Selah	19
ASV	Psalms	89	5	And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Jehovah; Thy faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.	19
ASV	Psalms	89	6	For who in the skies can be compared unto Jehovah? Who among the sons of the mighty is like unto Jehovah,	19
ASV	Psalms	89	7	A God very terrible in the council of the holy ones, And to be feared above all them that are round about him?	19
ASV	Psalms	89	8	O Jehovah God of hosts, Who is a mighty one, like unto thee, O Jehovah? And thy faithfulness is round about thee.	19
ASV	Psalms	89	9	Thou rulest the pride of the sea: When the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.	19
ASV	Psalms	89	10	Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; Thou hast scattered thine enemies with the arm of thy strength.	19
ASV	Psalms	89	11	The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: The world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.	19
ASV	Psalms	89	12	The north and the south, thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon rejoice in thy name.	19
ASV	Psalms	89	13	Thou hast a mighty arm; Strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.	19
ASV	Psalms	89	14	Righteousness and justice are the foundation of thy throne: Lovingkindness and truth go before thy face.	19
ASV	Psalms	89	15	Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: They walk, O Jehovah, in the light of thy countenance.	19

ASV	Psalms	103	12	As far as the east is from the west, So far hath he removed our transgressions from us.	19
ASV	Psalms	103	13	Like as a father pitieth his children, So Jehovah pitieth them that fear him.	19
ASV	Psalms	103	14	For he knoweth our frame; He remembereth that we are dust.	19
ASV	Psalms	103	15	As for man, his days are as grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.	19
ASV	Psalms	103	16	For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; And the place thereof shall know it no more.	19
ASV	Psalms	103	17	But the lovingkindness of Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, And his righteousness unto childrens children;	19
ASV	Psalms	103	18	To such as keep his covenant, And to those that remember his precepts to do them.	19
ASV	Psalms	103	19	Jehovah hath established his throne in the heavens; And his kingdom ruleth over all.	19
ASV	Psalms	103	20	Bless Jehovah, ye his angels, That are mighty in strength, that fulfil his word, Hearkening unto the voice of his word.	19
ASV	Psalms	103	21	Bless Jehovah, all ye his hosts, Ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.	19
ASV	Psalms	103	22	Bless Jehovah, all ye his works, In all places of his dominion: Bless Jehovah, O my soul.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	1	Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, thou art very great; Thou art clothed with honor and majesty:	19
ASV	Psalms	104	2	Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain;	19
ASV	Psalms	104	3	Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; Who maketh the clouds his chariot; Who walketh upon the wings of the wind;	19
ASV	Psalms	104	4	Who maketh winds his messengers; Flames of fire his ministers;	19
ASV	Psalms	104	5	Who laid the foundations of the earth, That it should not be moved for ever.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	6	Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture; The waters stood above the mountains.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	7	At thy rebuke they fled; At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away	19
ASV	Psalms	104	8	(The mountains rose, the valleys sank down) Unto the place which thou hadst founded for them.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	9	Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; That they turn not again to cover the earth.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	10	He sendeth forth springs into the valleys; They run among the mountains;	19
ASV	Psalms	104	11	They give drink to every beast of the field; The wild asses quench their thirst.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	12	By them the birds of the heavens have their habitation; They sing among the branches.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	13	He watereth the mountains from his chambers: The earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	14	He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, And herb for the service of man; That he may bring forth food out of the earth,	19
ASV	Psalms	104	15	And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, And oil to make his face to shine, And bread that strengtheneth mans heart.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	16	The trees of Jehovah are filled with moisture, The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;	19
ASV	Psalms	104	17	Where the birds make their nests: As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	18	The high mountains are for the wild goats; The rocks are a refuge for the conies.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	19	He appointed the moon for seasons: The sun knoweth his going down.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	20	Thou makest darkness, and it is night, Wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	21	The young lions roar after their prey, And seek their food from God.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	22	The sun ariseth, they get them away, And lay them down in their dens.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	23	Man goeth forth unto his work And to his labor until the evening.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	24	O Jehovah, how manifold are thy works! In wisdom hast thou made them all: The earth is full of thy riches.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	25	Yonder is the sea, great and wide, Wherein are things creeping innumerable, Both small and great beasts.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	26	There go the ships; There is leviathan, whom thou hast formed to play therein.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	27	These wait all for thee, That thou mayest give them their food in due season.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	28	Thou givest unto them, they gather; Thou openest thy hand, they are satisfied with good.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	29	Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; Thou takest away their breath, they die, And return to their dust.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	30	Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created; And thou renewest the face of the ground.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	31	Let the glory of Jehovah endure for ever; Let Jehovah rejoice in his works:	19
ASV	Psalms	104	32	Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	33	I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.	19
ASV	Psalms	104	34	Let thy meditation be sweet unto him: I will rejoice in Jehovah.	19

ASV	Psalms	105	2	Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; Talk ye of all his marvelous works.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	3	Glory ye in his holy name: Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	4	Seek ye Jehovah and his strength; Seek his face evermore.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	5	Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,	19
ASV	Psalms	105	6	O ye seed of Abraham his servant, Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	7	He is Jehovah our God: His judgments are in all the earth.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	8	He hath remembered his covenant for ever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,	19
ASV	Psalms	105	9	The covenant which he made with Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac,	19
ASV	Psalms	105	10	And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant,	19
ASV	Psalms	105	11	Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance;	19
ASV	Psalms	105	12	When they were but a few men in number, Yea, very few, and sojourners in it.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	13	And they went about from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another people.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	14	He suffered no man to do them wrong; Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,	19
ASV	Psalms	105	15	Saying, Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	16	And he called for a famine upon the land; He brake the whole staff of bread.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	17	He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a servant:	19
ASV	Psalms	105	18	His feet they hurt with fetters: He was laid in chains of iron,	19
ASV	Psalms	105	19	Until the time that his word came to pass, The word of Jehovah tried him.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	20	The king sent and loosed him; Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	21	He made him lord of his house, And ruler of all his substance;	19
ASV	Psalms	105	22	To bind his princes at his pleasure, And teach his elders wisdom.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	23	Israel also came into Egypt; And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	24	And he increased his people greatly, And made them stronger than their adversaries.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	25	He turned their heart to hate his people, To deal subtly with his servants.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	26	He sent Moses his servant, And Aaron whom he had chosen.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	27	They set among them his signs, And wonders in the land of Ham.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	28	He sent darkness, and made it dark; And they rebelled not against his words.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	29	He turned their waters into blood, And slew their fish.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	30	Their land swarmed with frogs In the chambers of their kings.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	31	He spake, and there came swarms of flies, And lice in all their borders.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	32	He gave them hail for rain, And flaming fire in their land.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	33	He smote their vines also and their fig-trees, And brake the trees of their borders.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	34	He spake, and the locust came, And the grasshopper, and that without number,	19
ASV	Psalms	105	35	And did eat up every herb in their land, And did eat up the fruit of their ground.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	36	He smote also all the first-born in their land, The chief of all their strength.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	37	And he brought them forth with silver and gold; And there was not one feeble person among his tribes.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	38	Egypt was glad when they departed; For the fear of them had fallen upon them.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	39	He spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to give light in the night.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	40	They asked, and he brought quails, And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	41	He opened the rock, and waters gushed out; They ran in the dry places like a river.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	42	For he remembered his holy word, And Abraham his servant.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	43	And he brought forth his people with joy, And his chosen with singing.	19
ASV	Psalms	105	44	And he gave them the lands of the nations; And they took the labor of the peoples in possession:	19
ASV	Psalms	105	45	That they might keep his statutes, And observe his laws. Praise ye Jehovah.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	1	Praise ye Jehovah. Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth forever.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	2	Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah, Or show forth all his praise?	19
ASV	Psalms	106	3	Blessed are they that keep justice, And he that doeth righteousness at all times.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	4	Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor that thou bearest unto thy people; Oh visit me with thy salvation,	19
ASV	Psalms	106	5	That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen, That I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, That I may glory with thine inheritance.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	6	We have sinned with our fathers, We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	7	Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; They remembered not the multitude of thy lovingkindnesses, But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	8	Nevertheless he saved them for his names sake, That he might make his mighty power to be known.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	9	He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	10	And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	11	And the waters covered their adversaries; There was not one of them left.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	12	Then believed they his words; They sang his praise.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	13	They soon forgat his works; They waited not for his counsel,	19
ASV	Psalms	106	14	But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, And tempted God in the desert.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	15	And he gave them their request, But sent leanness into their soul.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	16	They envied Moses also in the camp, And Aaron the saint of Jehovah.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	17	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, And covered the company of Abiram.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	18	And a fire was kindled in their company; The flame burned up the wicked.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	19	They made a calf in Horeb, And worshipped a molten image.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	20	Thus they changed their glory For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	21	They forgat God their Saviour, Who had done great things in Egypt,	19
ASV	Psalms	106	22	Wondrous works in the land of Ham, And terrible things by the Red Sea.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	23	Therefore he said that he would destroy them, Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	24	Yea, they despised the pleasant land, They believed not his word,	19
ASV	Psalms	106	25	But murmured in their tents, And hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	26	Therefore he sware unto them, That he would overthrow them in the wilderness,	19
ASV	Psalms	106	27	And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, And scatter them in the lands.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	28	They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, And ate the sacrifices of the dead.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	29	Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings; And the plague brake in upon them.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	30	Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment; And so the plague was stayed.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	31	And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness, Unto all generations for evermore.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	32	They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;	19
ASV	Psalms	106	33	Because they were rebellious against his spirit, And he spake unadvisedly with his lips.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	34	They did not destroy the peoples, As Jehovah commanded them,	19
ASV	Psalms	106	35	But mingled themselves with the nations, And learned their works,	19
ASV	Psalms	106	36	And served their idols, Which became a snare unto them.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	37	Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,	19
ASV	Psalms	106	38	And shed innocent blood, Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with blood.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	39	Thus were they defiled with their works, And played the harlot in their doings.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	40	Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against his people, And he abhorred his inheritance.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	41	And he gave them into the hand of the nations; And they that hated them ruled over them.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	42	Their enemies also oppressed them, And they were brought into subjection under their hand.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	43	Many times did he deliver them; But they were rebellious in their counsel, And were brought low in their iniquity.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	44	Nevertheless he regarded their distress, When he heard their cry:	19
ASV	Psalms	106	45	And he remembered for them his covenant, And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	46	He made them also to be pitied Of all those that carried them captive.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	47	Save us, O Jehovah our God, And gather us from among the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise.	19
ASV	Psalms	106	48	Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye Jehovah.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	1	O give thanks unto Jehovah; For he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	2	Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so, Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary,	19
ASV	Psalms	107	3	And gathered out of the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the south.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	4	They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; They found no city of habitation.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	5	Hungry and thirsty, Their soul fainted in them.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	6	Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he delivered them out of their distresses,	19
ASV	Psalms	107	7	He led them also by a straight way, That they might go to a city of habitation.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	8	Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!	19
ASV	Psalms	107	9	For he satisfieth the longing soul, And the hungry soul he filleth with good.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	10	Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, Being bound in affliction and iron,	19
ASV	Psalms	107	11	Because they rebelled against the words of God, And contemned the counsel of the Most High:	19
ASV	Psalms	107	12	Therefore he brought down their heart with labor; They fell down, and there was none to help.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	13	Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saved them out of their distresses.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	14	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And brake their bonds in sunder.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	15	Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!	19
ASV	Psalms	107	16	For he hath broken the gates of brass, And cut the bars of iron in sunder.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	17	Fools because of their transgression, And because of their iniquities, are afflicted.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	18	Their soul abhorreth all manner of food; And they draw near unto the gates of death.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	19	Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saveth them out of their distresses.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	20	He sendeth his word, and healeth them, And delivereth them from their destructions.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	21	Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!	19
ASV	Psalms	107	22	And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, And declare his works with singing.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	23	They that go down to the sea in ships, That do business in great waters;	19
ASV	Psalms	107	24	These see the works of Jehovah, And his wonders in the deep.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	25	For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, Which lifteth up the waves thereof.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	26	They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths: Their soul melteth away because of trouble.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	27	They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, And are at their wits end.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	28	Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he bringeth them out of their distresses.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	29	He maketh the storm a calm, So that the waves thereof are still.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	30	Then are they glad because they are quiet; So he bringeth them unto their desired haven.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	31	Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!	19
ASV	Psalms	107	32	Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, And praise him in the seat of the elders.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	33	He turneth rivers into a wilderness, And watersprings into a thirsty ground;	19
ASV	Psalms	107	34	A fruitful land into a salt desert, For the wickedness of them that dwell therein.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	35	He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water, And a dry land into watersprings.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	36	And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, That they may prepare a city of habitation,	19
ASV	Psalms	107	37	And sow fields, and plant vineyards, And get them fruits of increase.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	38	He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; And he suffereth not their cattle to decrease.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	39	Again, they are diminished and bowed down Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	40	He poureth contempt upon princes, And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	41	Yet setteth he the needy on high from affliction, And maketh him families like a flock.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	42	The upright shall see it, and be glad; And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.	19
ASV	Psalms	107	43	Whoso is wise will give heed to these things; And they will consider the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah.	19
ASV	Psalms	108	1	My heart is fixed, O God; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises, even with my glory.	19
ASV	Psalms	108	2	Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake right early.	19
ASV	Psalms	108	3	I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the peoples; And I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.	19
ASV	Psalms	108	4	For thy lovingkindness is great above the heavens; And thy truth reacheth unto the skies.	19
ASV	Psalms	108	5	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, And thy glory above all the earth.	19
ASV	Psalms	108	6	That thy beloved may be delivered, Save with thy right hand, and answer us.	19
ASV	Psalms	108	7	God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult; I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.	19
ASV	Psalms	108	8	Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre.	19
ASV	Psalms	108	9	Moab is my washpot; Upon Edom will I cast my shoe; Over Philistia will I shout.	19
ASV	Psalms	108	10	Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who hath led me unto Edom?	19
ASV	Psalms	108	11	Hast not thou cast us off, O God? And thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts.	19
ASV	Psalms	108	12	Give us help against the adversary; For vain is the help of man.	19
ASV	Psalms	108	13	Through God we shall do valiantly: For he it is that will tread down our adversaries.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	1	Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;	19
ASV	Psalms	109	2	For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit have they opened against me: They have spoken unto me with a lying tongue.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	3	They have compassed me about also with words of hatred, And fought against me without a cause.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	4	For my love they are my adversaries: But I give myself unto prayer.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	5	And they have rewarded me evil for good, And hatred for my love.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	6	Set thou a wicked man over him; And let an adversary stand at his right hand.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	7	When he is judged, let him come forth guilty; And let his prayer be turned into sin.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	8	Let his days be few; And let another take his office.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	9	Let his children be fatherless, And his wife a widow.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	10	Let his children be vagabonds, and beg; And let them seek their bread out of their desolate places.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	11	Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; And let strangers make spoil of his labor.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	12	Let there be none to extend kindness unto him; Neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless children.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	13	Let his posterity be cut off; In the generation following let their name be blotted out.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	14	Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with Jehovah; And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	15	Let them be before Jehovah continually, That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth;	19
ASV	Psalms	109	16	Because he remembered not to show kindness, But persecuted the poor and needy man, And the broken in heart, to slay them.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	17	Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him; And he delighted not in blessing, and it was far from him.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	18	He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment, And it came into his inward parts like water, And like oil into his bones.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	19	Let it be unto him as the raiment wherewith he covereth himself, And for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	20	This is the reward of mine adversaries from Jehovah, And of them that speak evil against my soul.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	21	But deal thou with me, O Jehovah the Lord, for thy names sake: Because thy lovingkindness is good, deliver thou me;	19
ASV	Psalms	109	22	For I am poor and needy, And my heart is wounded within me.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	23	I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	24	My knees are weak through fasting; And my flesh faileth of fatness.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	25	I am become also a reproach unto them: When they see me, they shake their head.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	26	Help me, O Jehovah my God; Oh save me according to thy lovingkindness:	19
ASV	Psalms	109	27	That they may know that this is thy hand; That thou, Jehovah, hast done it.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	28	Let them curse, but bless thou: When they arise, they shall be put to shame, But thy servant shall rejoice.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	29	Let mine adversaries be clothed with dishonor, And let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	30	I will give great thanks unto Jehovah with my mouth; Yea, I will praise him among the multitude.	19
ASV	Psalms	109	31	For he will stand at the right hand of the needy, To save him from them that judge his soul.	19
ASV	Psalms	110	1	Jehovah saith unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, Until I make thine enemies thy footstool.	19
ASV	Psalms	110	2	Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.	19
ASV	Psalms	110	3	Thy people offer themselves willingly In the day of thy power, in holy array: Out of the womb of the morning Thou hast the dew of thy youth.	19
ASV	Psalms	110	4	Jehovah hath sworn, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek.	19
ASV	Psalms	110	5	The Lord at thy right hand Will strike through kings in the day of his wrath.	19

ASV	Proverbs	1	10	My son, if sinners entice thee, Consent thou not.	20

ASV	Proverbs	3	33	The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked; But he blesseth the habitation of the righteous.	20
ASV	Proverbs	3	34	Surely he scoffeth at the scoffers; But he giveth grace unto the lowly.	20

ASV	Proverbs	4	1	Hear, my sons, the instruction of a father, And attend to know understanding:	20
ASV	Proverbs	4	2	For I give you good doctrine; Forsake ye not my law.	20
ASV	Proverbs	4	3	For I was a son unto my father, Tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.	20
ASV	Proverbs	4	4	And he taught me, and said unto me: Let thy heart retain my words; Keep my commandments, and live;	20
ASV	Proverbs	4	5	Get wisdom, get understanding; Forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth;	20
ASV	Proverbs	4	6	Forsake her not, and she will preserve thee; Love her, and she will keep thee.	20
ASV	Proverbs	4	7	Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom; Yea, with all thy getting get understanding.	20
ASV	Proverbs	4	8	Exalt her, and she will promote thee; She will bring thee to honor, when thou dost embrace her.	20
ASV	Proverbs	4	9	She will give to thy head a chaplet of grace; A crown of beauty will she deliver to thee.	20
ASV	Proverbs	4	10	Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; And the years of thy life shall be many.	20
ASV	Proverbs	4	11	I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in paths of uprightness.	20
ASV	Proverbs	4	12	When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; And if thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.	20
ASV	Proverbs	4	13	Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: Keep her; for she is thy life.	20
ASV	Proverbs	4	14	Enter not into the path of the wicked, And walk not in the way of evil men.	20
ASV	Proverbs	4	15	Avoid it, pass not by it; Turn from it, and pass on.	20
ASV	Proverbs	4	16	For they sleep not, except they do evil; And their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.	20
ASV	Proverbs	4	17	For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence.	20
ASV	Proverbs	4	18	But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light, That shineth more and more unto the perfect day.	20
ASV	Proverbs	4	19	The way of the wicked is as darkness: They know not at what they stumble.	20
ASV	Proverbs	4	20	My son, attend to my words; Incline thine ear unto my sayings.	20
ASV	Proverbs	4	21	Let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep them in the midst of thy heart.	20
ASV	Proverbs	4	22	For they are life unto those that find them, And health to all their flesh.	20

ASV	Proverbs	4	25	Let thine eyes look right on, And let thine eyelids look straight before thee.	20
ASV	Proverbs	4	26	Make level the path of thy feet, And let all thy ways be established.	20
ASV	Proverbs	4	27	Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: Remove thy foot from evil.	20
ASV	Proverbs	5	1	My son, attend unto my wisdom; Incline thine ear to my understanding:	20
ASV	Proverbs	5	2	That thou mayest preserve discretion, And that thy lips may keep knowledge.	20
ASV	Proverbs	5	3	For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And her mouth is smoother than oil:	20
ASV	Proverbs	5	4	But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword.	20
ASV	Proverbs	5	5	Her feet go down to death; Her steps take hold on Sheol;	20
ASV	Proverbs	5	6	So that she findeth not the level path of life: Her ways are unstable, and she knoweth it not.	20
ASV	Proverbs	5	7	Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me, And depart not from the words of my mouth.	20
ASV	Proverbs	5	8	Remove thy way far from her, And come not nigh the door of her house;	20
ASV	Proverbs	5	9	Lest thou give thine honor unto others, And thy years unto the cruel;	20
ASV	Proverbs	5	10	Lest strangers be filled with thy strength, And thy labors be in the house of an alien,	20
ASV	Proverbs	5	11	And thou mourn at thy latter end, When thy flesh and thy body are consumed,	20
ASV	Proverbs	5	12	And say, How have I hated instruction, And my heart despised reproof;	20
ASV	Proverbs	5	13	Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!	20
ASV	Proverbs	5	14	I was well-nigh in all evil In the midst of the assembly and congregation.	20
ASV	Proverbs	5	15	Drink waters out of thine own cistern, And running waters out of thine own well.	20
ASV	Proverbs	5	16	Should thy springs be dispersed abroad, And streams of water in the streets?	20
ASV	Proverbs	5	17	Let them be for thyself alone, And not for strangers with thee.	20
ASV	Proverbs	5	18	Let thy fountain be blessed; And rejoice in the wife of thy youth.	20
ASV	Proverbs	5	19	As a loving hind and a pleasant doe, Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; And be thou ravished always with her love.	20
ASV	Proverbs	5	20	For why shouldest thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?	20
ASV	Proverbs	5	21	For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah; And he maketh level all his paths.	20
ASV	Proverbs	5	22	His own iniquities shall take the wicked, And he shall be holden with the cords of his sin.	20
ASV	Proverbs	5	23	He shall die for lack of instruction; And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	1	My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbor, If thou hast stricken thy hands for a stranger;	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	2	Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, Thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	3	Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, Seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbor: Go, humble thyself, and importune thy neighbor;	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	4	Give not sleep to thine eyes, Nor slumber to thine eyelids;	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	5	Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, And as a bird from the hand of the fowler.	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	6	Go to the ant, thou sluggard; Consider her ways, and be wise:	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	7	Which having no chief, Overseer, or ruler,	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	8	Provideth her bread in the summer, And gathereth her food in the harvest.	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	9	How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	10	Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep:	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	11	So shall thy poverty come as a robber, And thy want as an armed man.	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	12	A worthless person, a man of iniquity, Is he that walketh with a perverse mouth;	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	13	That winketh with his eyes, that speaketh with his feet, That maketh signs with his fingers;	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	14	In whose heart is perverseness, Who deviseth evil continually, Who soweth discord.	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	15	Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; On a sudden shall he be broken, and that without remedy.	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	16	There are six things which Jehovah hateth; Yea, seven which are an abomination unto him:	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	17	Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent blood;	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	18	A heart that deviseth wicked purposes, Feet that are swift in running to mischief,	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	19	A false witness that uttereth lies, And he that soweth discord among brethren.	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	20	My son, keep the commandment of thy father, And forsake not the law of thy mother:	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	21	Bind them continually upon thy heart; Tie them about thy neck.	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	22	When thou walkest, it shall lead thee; When thou sleepest, it shall watch over thee; And when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	23	For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; And reproofs of instruction are the way of life:	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	24	To keep thee from the evil woman, From the flattery of the foreigners tongue.	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	25	Lust not after her beauty in thy heart; Neither let her take thee with her eyelids.	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	26	For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a piece of bread; And the adulteress hunteth for the precious life.	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	27	Can a man take fire in his bosom, And his clothes not be burned?	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	28	Or can one walk upon hot coals, And his feet not be scorched?	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	29	So he that goeth in to his neighbors wife; Whosoever toucheth her shall not be unpunished.	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	30	Men do not despise a thief, if he steal To satisfy himself when he is hungry:	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	31	But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; He shall give all the substance of his house.	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	32	He that committeth adultery with a woman is void of understanding: He doeth it who would destroy his own soul.	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	33	Wounds and dishonor shall he get; And his reproach shall not be wiped away.	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	34	For jealousy is the rage of a man; And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.	20
ASV	Proverbs	6	35	He will not regard any ransom; Neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	1	My son, keep my words, And lay up my commandments with thee.	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	2	Keep my commandments and live; And my law as the apple of thine eye.	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	3	Bind them upon thy fingers; Write them upon the tablet of thy heart.	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	4	Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; And call understanding thy kinswoman:	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	5	That they may keep thee from the strange woman, From the foreigner that flattereth with her words.	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	6	For at the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice;	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	7	And I beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, A young man void of understanding,	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	8	Passing through the street near her corner; And he went the way to her house,	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	9	In the twilight, in the evening of the day, In the middle of the night and in the darkness.	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	10	And, behold, there met him a woman With the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart.	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	11	She is clamorous and wilful; Her feet abide not in her house:	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	12	Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, And lieth in wait at every corner.	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	13	So she caught him, and kissed him, And with an impudent face she said unto him:	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	14	Sacrifices of peace-offerings are with me; This day have I paid my vows.	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	15	Therefore came I forth to meet thee, Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	16	I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, With striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	17	I have perfumed my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	18	Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; Let us solace ourselves with loves.	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	19	For the man is not at home; He is gone a long journey:	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	20	He hath taken a bag of money with him; He will come home at the full moon.	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	21	With her much fair speech she causeth him to yield; With the flattering of her lips she forceth him along.	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	22	He goeth after her straightway, As an ox goeth to the slaughter, Or as one in fetters to the correction of the fool;	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	23	Till an arrow strike through his liver; As a bird hasteth to the snare, And knoweth not that it is for his life.	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	24	Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me, And attend to the words of my mouth.	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	25	Let not thy heart decline to her ways; Go not astray in her paths.	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	26	For she hath cast down many wounded: Yea, all her slain are a mighty host.	20
ASV	Proverbs	7	27	Her house is the way to Sheol, Going down to the chambers of death.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	1	Doth not wisdom cry, And understanding put forth her voice?	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	2	On the top of high places by the way, Where the paths meet, she standeth;	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	3	Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, At the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud:	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	4	Unto you, O men, I call; And my voice is to the sons of men.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	5	O ye simple, understand prudence; And, ye fools, be of an understanding heart.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	6	Hear, for I will speak excellent things; And the opening of my lips shall be right things.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	7	For my mouth shall utter truth; And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	8	All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	9	They are all plain to him that understandeth, And right to them that find knowledge.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	10	Receive my instruction, and not silver; And knowledge rather than choice gold.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	11	For wisdom is better than rubies; And all the things that may be desired are not to be compared unto it.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	12	I wisdom have made prudence my dwelling, And find out knowledge and discretion.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	13	The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil: Pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, And the perverse mouth, do I hate.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	14	Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge: I am understanding; I have might.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	15	By me kings reign, And princes decree justice.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	16	By me princes rule, And nobles, even all the judges of the earth.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	17	I love them that love me; And those that seek me diligently shall find me.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	18	Riches and honor are with me; Yea, durable wealth and righteousness.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	19	My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; And my revenue than choice silver.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	20	I walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice;	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	21	That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, And that I may fill their treasuries.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	22	Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way, Before his works of old.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	23	I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, Before the earth was.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	24	When there were no depths, I was brought forth, When there were no fountains abounding with water.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	25	Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills was I brought forth;	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	26	While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, Nor the beginning of the dust of the world.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	27	When he established the heavens, I was there: When he set a circle upon the face of the deep,	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	28	When he made firm the skies above, When the fountains of the deep became strong,	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	29	When he gave to the sea its bound, That the waters should not transgress his commandment, When he marked out the foundations of the earth;	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	30	Then I was by him, as a master workman; And I was daily his delight, Rejoicing always before him,	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	31	Rejoicing in his habitable earth; And my delight was with the sons of men.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	32	Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me; For blessed are they that keep my ways.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	33	Hear instruction, and be wise, And refuse it not.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	34	Blessed is the man that heareth me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at the posts of my doors.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	35	For whoso findeth me findeth life, And shall obtain favor of Jehovah.	20
ASV	Proverbs	8	36	But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: All they that hate me love death.	20
ASV	Proverbs	9	1	Wisdom hath builded her house; She hath hewn out her seven pillars:	20
ASV	Proverbs	9	2	She hath killed her beasts; She hath mingled her wine; She hath also furnished her table:	20
ASV	Proverbs	9	3	She hath sent forth her maidens; She crieth upon the highest places of the city:	20
ASV	Proverbs	9	4	Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: As for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him,	20
ASV	Proverbs	9	5	Come, eat ye of my bread, And drink of the wine which I have mingled.	20
ASV	Proverbs	9	6	Leave off, ye simple ones, and live; And walk in the way of understanding.	20

ASV	Proverbs	9	13	The foolish woman is clamorous; She is simple, and knoweth nothing.	20
ASV	Proverbs	9	14	And she sitteth at the door of her house, On a seat in the high places of the city,	20
ASV	Proverbs	9	15	To call to them that pass by, Who go right on their ways:	20
ASV	Proverbs	9	16	Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither; And as for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him,	20
ASV	Proverbs	9	17	Stolen waters are sweet, And bread eaten in secret is pleasant.	20

ASV	Proverbs	30	23	For an odious woman when she is married; And a handmaid that is heir to her mistress.	20
ASV	Proverbs	30	24	There are four things which are little upon the earth, But they are exceeding wise:	20

ASV	Proverbs	30	26	The conies are but a feeble folk, Yet make they their houses in the rocks;	20

ASV	Proverbs	30	28	The lizard taketh hold with her hands, Yet is she in kings palaces.	20
ASV	Proverbs	30	29	There are three things which are stately in their march, Yea, four which are stately in going:	20

ASV	Proverbs	30	31	The greyhound; the he-goat also; And the king against whom there is no rising up.	20
ASV	Proverbs	30	32	If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, Or if thou hast thought evil, Lay thy hand upon thy mouth.	20
ASV	Proverbs	30	33	For the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, And the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood; So the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.	20
ASV	Proverbs	31	1	The words of king Lemuel; the oracle which his mother taught him.	20
ASV	Proverbs	31	2	What, my son? and what, O son of my womb? And what, O son of my vows?	20
ASV	Proverbs	31	3	Give not thy strength unto women, Nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.	20

ASV	Proverbs	31	24	She maketh linen garments and selleth them, And delivereth girdles unto the merchant.	20

ASV	Proverbs	31	29	Many daughters have done worthily, But thou excellest them all.	20
ASV	Proverbs	31	30	Grace is deceitful, and beauty is vain; But a woman that feareth Jehovah, she shall be praised.	20
ASV	Proverbs	31	31	Give her of the fruit of her hands; And let her works praise her in the gates.	20
ASV	Ecclesiastes	1	1	The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	1	2	Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; vanity of vanities, all is vanity.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	1	3	What profit hath man of all his labor wherein he laboreth under the sun?	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	1	4	One generation goeth, and another generation cometh; but the earth abideth for ever.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	1	5	The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to its place where it ariseth.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	1	6	The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it turneth about continually in its course, and the wind returneth again to its circuits.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	1	7	All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place whither the rivers go, thither they go again.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	1	8	All things are full of weariness; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	1	9	That which hath been is that which shall be; and that which hath been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	1	10	Is there a thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been long ago, in the ages which were before us.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	1	11	There is no remembrance of the former generations; neither shall there be any remembrance of the latter generations that are to come, among those that shall come after.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	1	12	I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	1	13	And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven: it is a sore travail that God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	1	14	I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	1	15	That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	1	16	I communed with mine own hear, saying, Lo, I have gotten me great wisdom above all that were before me in Jerusalem; yea, my heart hath had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	1	17	And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also was a striving after wind.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	1	18	For in much wisdom is much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	1	I said in my heart, Come now, I will prove thee with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also was vanity.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	2	I said of laughter, It is mad; and of mirth, What doeth it?	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	3	I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart yet guiding me with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their life.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	4	I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards;	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	5	I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit;	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	6	I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared;	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	7	I bought men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all that were before me in Jerusalem;	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	8	I gathered me also silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces; I gat me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men, musical instruments, and that of all sorts.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	9	So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	10	And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor; and this was my portion from all my labor.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	11	Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	12	And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been done long ago.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	13	Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	14	The wise mans eyes are in his head, and the fool walketh in darkness: and yet I perceived that one event happeneth to them all.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	15	Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then said I in my heart, that this also is vanity.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	16	For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. And how doth the wise man die even as the fool!	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	17	So I hated life, because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	18	And I hated all my labor wherein I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	19	And who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	20	Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor wherein I had labored under the sun.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	21	For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skilfulness; yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	22	For what hath a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboreth under the sun?	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	23	For all his days are but sorrows, and his travail is grief; yea, even in the night his heart taketh no rest. This also is vanity.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	24	There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	25	For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	2	26	For to the man that pleaseth him God giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that pleaseth God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	3	1	For everything there is a season, and a time for very purpose under heaven:	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	3	2	a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	3	3	a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	3	4	a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	3	5	a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	3	6	a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	3	7	a time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	3	8	a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	3	9	What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth?	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	3	10	I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	3	11	He hath made everything beautiful in its time: also he hath set eternity in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out the work that God hath done from the beginning even to the end.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	3	12	I know that there is nothing better for them, than to rejoice, and to do good so long as they live.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	3	13	And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of God.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	3	14	I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it; and God hath done it, that men should fear before him.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	3	15	That which is hath been long ago; and that which is to be hath long ago been: and God seeketh again that which is passed away.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	3	16	And moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	3	17	I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	3	18	I said in my heart, It is because of the sons of men, that God may prove them, and that they may see that they themselves are but as beasts.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	3	19	For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; and man hath no preeminence above the beasts: for all is vanity.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	3	20	All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	3	21	Who knoweth the spirit of man, whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast, whether it goeth downward to the earth?	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	3	22	Wherefore I saw that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him back to see what shall be after him?	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	4	1	Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and, behold, the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	4	2	Wherefore I praised the dead that have been long dead more than the living that are yet alive;	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	4	3	yea, better than them both did I esteem him that hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	4	4	Then I saw all labor and every skilful work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	4	5	The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	4	6	Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and striving after wind.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	4	7	Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	4	8	There is one that is alone, and he hath not a second; yea, he hath neither son nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches. For whom then, saith he, do I labor, and deprive my soul of good? This also is va	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	4	9	Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	4	10	For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to lift him up.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	4	11	Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm alone?	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	4	12	And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	4	13	Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king, who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	4	14	For out of prison he came forth to be king; yea, even in his kingdom he was born poor.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	4	15	I saw all the living that walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the second, that stood up in his stead.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	4	16	There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was: yet they that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	5	1	Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God; for to draw nigh to hear is better than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they know not that they do evil.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	5	2	Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter anything before God; for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	5	3	For a dream cometh with a multitude of business, and a fools voice with a multitude of words.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	5	4	When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou vowest.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	5	5	Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	5	6	Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that is was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	5	7	For in the multitude of dreams there are vanities, and in many words: but fear thou God.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	5	8	If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and the violent taking away of justice and righteousness in a province, marvel not at the matter: for one higher than the high regardeth; and there are higher than they.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	5	9	Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by the field.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	5	10	He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance, with increase: this also is vanity.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	5	11	When goods increase, they are increased that eat them; and what advantage is there to the owner thereof, save the beholding of them with his eyes?	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	5	12	The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much; but the fulness of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	5	13	There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept by the owner thereof to his hurt:	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	5	14	and those riches perish by evil adventure; and if he hath begotten a son, there is nothing in his hand.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	5	15	As he came forth from his mothers womb, naked shall he go again as he came, and shall take nothing for his labor, which he may carry away in his hand.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	5	16	And this also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that he laboreth for the wind?	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	5	17	All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he is sore vexed, and hath sickness and wrath.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	5	18	Behold, that which I have seen to be good and to be comely is for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labor, wherein he laboreth under the sun, all the days of his life which God hath given him: for this is his portion.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	5	19	Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor-this is the gift of God.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	5	20	For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	6	1	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is heavy upon men:	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	6	2	a man to whom God giveth riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacketh nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but an alien eateth it; this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	6	3	If a man beget a hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul be not filled with good, and moreover he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he:	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	6	4	for it cometh in vanity, and departeth in darkness, and the name thereof is covered with darkness;	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	6	5	moreover it hath not seen the sun nor known it; this hath rest rather than the other:	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	6	6	yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, and yet enjoy no good, do not all go to one place?	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	6	7	All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	6	8	For what advantage hath the wise more than the fool? or what hath the poor man, that knoweth how to walk before the living?	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	6	9	Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this also is vanity and a striving after wind.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	6	10	Whatsoever hath been, the name thereof was given long ago; and it is know what man is; neither can he contend with him that is mightier than he.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	6	11	Seeing there are many things that increase vanity, what is man the better?	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	6	12	For who knoweth what is good for man in his life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	1	A good name is better than precious oil; and the day of death, than the day of ones birth.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	2	It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	3	Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made glad.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	4	The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	5	It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	6	For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	7	Surely extortion maketh the wise man foolish; and a bribe destroyeth the understanding.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	8	Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof; and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	9	Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry; for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	10	Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	11	Wisdom is as good as an inheritance; yea, more excellent is it for them that see the sun.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	12	For wisdom is a defence, even as money is a defence; but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom preserveth the life of him that hath it.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	13	Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	14	In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; yea, God hath made the one side by side with the other, to the end that man should not find out anything that shall be after him.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	15	All this have I seen in my days of vanity: there is a righteous man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his evil-doing.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	16	Be not righteous overmuch; neither make thyself overwise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	17	Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	18	It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from that withdraw not thy hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth from them all.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	19	Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers that are in a city.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	20	Surely there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	21	Also take not heed unto all words that are spoken, lest thou hear thy servant curse thee;	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	22	for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	23	All this have I proved in wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	24	That which is, is far off and exceeding deep; who can find it out?	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	25	I turned about, and my heart was set to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the reason of things, and to know that wickedness is folly, and that foolishness is madness.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	26	And I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and whose hands are bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	27	Behold, this have I found, saith the Preacher, laying one thing to another, to find out the account;	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	28	which my soul still seeketh, but I have not found: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	7	29	Behold, this only have I found: that God made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	8	1	Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? A mans wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the hardness of his face is changed.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	8	2	I counsel thee, Keep the kings command, and that in regard of the oath of God.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	8	3	Be not hasty to go out of his presence; persist not in an evil thing: for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	8	4	For the kings word hath power; and who may say unto him, What doest thou?	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	8	5	Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing; and a wise mans heart discerneth time and judgment:	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	8	6	for to every purpose there is a time and judgment; because the misery of man is great upon him:	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	8	7	for he knoweth not that which shall be; for who can tell him how it shall be?	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	8	8	There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power over the day of death; and there is no discharge in war: neither shall wickedness deliver him that is given to it.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	8	9	All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man hath power over another to his hurt.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	8	10	So I saw the wicked buried, and they came to the grave; and they that had done right went away from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city: this also is vanity.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	8	11	Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	8	12	Though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and prolong his days, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, that fear before him:	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	8	13	but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	8	14	There is a vanity which is done upon the earth, that there are righteous men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vani	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	8	15	Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful: for that shall abide with him in his labor all the days of his life which God hath given him under the sun.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	8	16	When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes),	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	8	17	then I beheld all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because however much a man labor to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea moreover, though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	9	1	For all this I laid to my heart, even to explore all this: that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God; whether it be love or hatred, man knoweth it not; all is before them.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	9	2	All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not; as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he th	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	9	3	This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea also, the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	9	4	For to him that is joined with all the living there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lion.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	9	5	For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not anything, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	9	6	As well their love, as their hatred and their envy, is perished long ago; neither have they any more a portion for ever in anything that is done under the sun.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	9	7	Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God hath already accepted thy works.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	9	8	Let thy garments be always white; and let not thy head lack oil.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	9	9	Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of thy life of vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all thy days of vanity: for that is thy portion in life, and in thy labor wherein thou laborest under the sun.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	9	10	Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in Sheol, whither thou goest.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	9	11	I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	9	12	For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare, even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	9	13	I have also seen wisdom under the sun on this wise, and it seemed great unto me:	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	9	14	There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	9	15	Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	9	16	Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor mans wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	9	17	The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	9	18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner destroyeth much good.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	10	1	Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to send forth an evil odor; so doth a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	10	2	A wise mans heart is at his right hand; but a fools heart at his left.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	10	3	Yea also, when the fool walketh by the way, his understanding faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	10	4	If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for gentleness allayeth great offences.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	10	5	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as it were an error which proceedeth from the ruler:	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	10	6	folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	10	7	I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking like servants upon the earth.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	10	8	He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh through a wall, a serpent shall bite him.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	10	9	Whoso heweth out stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	10	10	If the iron be blunt, and one do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	10	11	If the serpent bite before it is charmed, then is there no advantage in the charmer.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	10	12	The words of a wise mans mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	10	13	The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	10	14	A fool also multiplieth words: yet man knoweth not what shall be; and that which shall be after him, who can tell him?	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	10	15	The labor of fools wearieth every one of them; for he knoweth not how to go to the city.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	10	16	Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	10	17	Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	10	18	By slothfulness the roof sinketh in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaketh.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	10	19	A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh glad the life; and money answereth all things.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	10	20	Revile not the king, no, not in thy thought; and revile not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the heavens shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	11	1	Cast thy bread upon the waters; for thou shalt find it after many days.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	11	2	Give a portion to seven, yea, even unto eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	11	3	If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth; and if a tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there shall it be.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	11	4	He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	11	5	As thou knowest not what is the way of the wind, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child; even so thou knowest not the work of God who doeth all.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	11	6	In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand; for thou knowest not which shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	11	7	Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	11	8	Yea, if a man live many years, let him rejoice in them all; but let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	11	9	Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	11	10	Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh; for youth and the dawn of life are vanity.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	12	1	Remember also thy Creator in the days of thy youth, before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	12	2	before the sun, and the light, and the moon, and the stars, are darkened, and the clouds return after the rain;	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	12	3	in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows shall be darkened,	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	12	4	and the doors shall be shut in the street; when the sound of the grinding is low, and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	12	5	yea, they shall be afraid of that which is high, and terrors shall be in the way; and the almond-tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goeth to his everlasting home, and the mourners go about the str	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	12	6	before the silver cord is loosed, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern,	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	12	7	and the dust returneth to the earth as it was, and the spirit returneth unto God who gave it.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	12	8	Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	12	9	And further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he pondered, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	12	10	The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that which was written uprightly, even words of truth.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	12	11	The words of the wise are as goads; and as nails well fastened are the words of the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	12	12	And furthermore, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	12	13	This is the end of the matter; all hath been heard: fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man.	21
ASV	Ecclesiastes	12	14	For God will bring every work into judgment, with every hidden thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.	21
ASV	Song of Solomon	1	1	The Song of songs, which is Solomons.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	1	2	Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; For thy love is better than wine.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	1	3	Thine oils have a goodly fragrance; Thy name is as oil poured forth; Therefore do the virgins love thee.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	1	4	Draw me; we will run after thee: The king hath brought me into his chambers; We will be glad and rejoice in thee; We will make mention of thy love more than of wine: Rightly do they love thee.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	1	5	I am black, but comely, Oh ye daughters of Jerusalem, As the tents of Kedar, As the curtains of Solomon.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	1	6	Look not upon me, because I am swarthy, Because the sun hath scorched me. My mothers sons were incensed against me; They made me keeper of the vineyards; But mine own vineyard have I not kept.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	1	7	Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, Where thou feedest thy flock, Where thou makest it to rest at noon: For why should I be as one that is veiled Beside the flocks of thy companions?	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	1	8	If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, And feed thy kids beside the shepherds tents.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	1	9	I have compared thee, O my love, To a steed in Pharaohs chariots.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	1	10	Thy cheeks are comely with plaits of hair, Thy neck with strings of jewels.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	1	11	We will make thee plaits of gold With studs of silver.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	1	12	While the king sat at his table, My spikenard sent forth its fragrance.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	1	13	My beloved is unto me as a bundle of myrrh, That lieth betwixt my breasts.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	1	14	My beloved is unto me as a cluster of henna-flowers In the vineyards of En-gedi.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	1	15	Behold, thou art fair, my love; Behold thou art fair; Thine eyes are as doves.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	1	16	Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: Also our couch is green.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	1	17	The beams of our house are cedars, And our rafters are firs.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	2	1	I am a rose of Sharon, A lily of the valleys.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	2	2	As a lily among thorns, So is my love among the daughters.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	2	3	As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, So is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, And his fruit was sweet to my taste.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	2	4	He brought me to the banqueting-house, And his banner over me was love.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	2	5	Stay ye me with raisins, refresh me with apples; For I am sick from love.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	2	6	His left hand is under my head, And his right hand doth embrace me.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	2	7	I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes, or by the hinds of the field, That ye stir not up, nor awake my love, Until he please.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	2	8	The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh, Leaping upon the mountains, Skipping upon the hills.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	2	9	My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: Behold, he standeth behind our wall; He looketh in at the windows; He glanceth through the lattice.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	2	10	My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	2	11	For, lo, the winter is past; The rain is over and gone;	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	2	12	The flowers appear on the earth; The time of the singing of birds is come, And the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land;	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	2	13	The fig-tree ripeneth her green figs, And the vines are in blossom; They give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	2	14	O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, In the covert of the steep place, Let me see thy countenance, Let me hear thy voice; For sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	2	15	Take us the foxes, the little foxes, That spoil the vineyards; For our vineyards are in blossom.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	2	16	My beloved is mine, and I am his: He feedeth his flock among the lilies.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	2	17	Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart Upon the mountains of Bether.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	3	1	By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	3	2	I said, I will rise now, and go about the city; In the streets and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	3	3	The watchmen that go about the city found me; To whom I said, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	3	4	It was but a little that I passed from them, When I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, Until I had brought him into my mothers house, And into the chamber of her that conceived me.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	3	5	I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes, or by the hinds of the field, That ye stir not up, nor awake my love, Until he please.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	3	6	Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all powders of the merchant?	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	3	7	Behold, it is the litter of Solomon; Threescore mighty men are about it, Of the mighty men of Israel.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	3	8	They all handle the sword, and are expert in war: Every man hath his sword upon his thigh, Because of fear in the night.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	3	9	King Solomon made himself a palanquin Of the wood of Lebanon.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	3	10	He made the pillars thereof of silver, The bottom thereof of gold, the seat of it of purple, The midst thereof being paved with love, From the daughters of Jerusalem.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	3	11	Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon, With the crown wherewith his mother hath crowned him In the day of his espousals, And in the day of the gladness of his heart.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	4	1	Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; Thine eyes are as doves behind thy veil. Thy hair is as a flock of goats, That lie along the side of mount Gilead.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	4	2	Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes that are newly shorn, Which are come up from the washing, Whereof every one hath twins, And none is bereaved among them.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	4	3	Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, And thy mouth is comely. Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate Behind thy veil.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	4	4	Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armory, Whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, All the shields of the mighty men.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	4	5	Thy two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a roe, Which feed among the lilies.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	4	6	Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, And to the hill of frankincense.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	4	7	Thou art all fair, my love; And there is no spot in thee.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	4	8	Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, With me from Lebanon: Look from the top of Amana, From the top of Senir and Hermon, From the lions dens, From the mountains of the leopards.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	4	9	Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my bride; Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, With one chain of thy neck.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	4	10	How fair is thy love, my sister, my bride! How much better is thy love than wine! And the fragrance of thine oils than all manner of spices!	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	4	11	Thy lips, O my bride, drop as the honeycomb: Honey and milk are under thy tongue; And the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	4	12	A garden shut up is my sister, my bride; A spring shut up, a fountain sealed.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	4	13	Thy shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits; Henna with spikenard plants,	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	4	14	Spikenard and saffron, Calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	4	15	Thou art a fountain of gardens, A well of living waters, And flowing streams from Lebanon.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	4	16	Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; Blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, And eat his precious fruits.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	5	1	I am come into my garden, my sister, my bride: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends; Drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	5	2	I was asleep, but my heart waked: It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; For my head is filled with dew, My locks with the drops of the night.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	5	3	I have put off my garment; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	5	4	My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, And my heart was moved for him.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	5	5	I rose up to open to my beloved; And my hands droppeth with myrrh, And my fingers with liquid myrrh, Upon the handles of the bolt.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	5	6	I opened to my beloved; But my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone. My soul had failed me when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	5	7	The watchmen that go about the city found me, They smote me, they wounded me; The keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	5	8	I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, If ye find my beloved, That ye tell him, that I am sick from love.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	5	9	What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? What is thy beloved more than another beloved, That thou dost so adjure us?	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	5	10	My beloved is white and ruddy, The chiefest among ten thousand.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	5	11	His head is as the most fine gold; His locks are bushy, and black as a raven.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	5	12	His eyes are like doves beside the water-brooks, Washed with milk, and fitly set.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	5	13	His cheeks are as a bed of spices, As banks of sweet herbs: His lips are as lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	5	14	His hands are as rings of gold set with beryl: His body is as ivory work overlaid with sapphires.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	5	15	His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: His aspect is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	5	16	His mouth is most sweet; Yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	6	1	Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? Whither hath thy beloved turned him, That we may seek him with thee?	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	6	2	My beloved is gone down to his garden, To the beds of spices, To feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	6	3	I am my beloveds, and my beloved is mine; He feedeth his flock among the lilies,	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	6	4	Thou art fair, O my love, as Tirzah, Comely as Jerusalem, Terrible as an army with banners.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	6	5	Turn away thine eyes from me, For they have overcome me. Thy hair is as a flock of goats, That lie along the side of Gilead.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	6	6	Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes, Which are come up from the washing; Whereof every one hath twins, And none is bereaved among them.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	6	7	Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate Behind thy veil.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	6	8	There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, And virgins without number.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	6	9	My dove, my undefiled, is but one; She is the only one of her mother; She is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and called her blessed; Yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	6	10	Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, Fair as the moon, Clear as the sun, Terrible as an army with banners?	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	6	11	I went down into the garden of nuts, To see the green plants of the valley, To see whether the vine budded, And the pomegranates were in flower.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	6	12	Before I was aware, my soul set me Among the chariots of my princely people.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	6	13	Return, return, O Shulammite; Return, return, that we may look upon thee. Why will ye look upon the Shulammite, As upon the dance of Mahanaim?	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	7	1	How beautiful are thy feet in sandals, O princes daughter! Thy rounded thighs are like jewels, The work of the hands of a skilful workman.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	7	2	Thy body is like a round goblet, Wherein no mingled wine is wanting: Thy waist is like a heap of wheat Set about with lilies.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	7	3	Thy two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a roe.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	7	4	Thy neck is like the tower of ivory; Thine eyes as the pools in Heshbon, By the gate of Bath-rabbim; Thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon Which looketh toward Damascus.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	7	5	Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, And the hair of thy head like purple; The king is held captive in the tresses thereof.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	7	6	How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	7	7	This thy stature is like to a palm-tree, And thy breasts to its clusters.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	7	8	I said, I will climb up into the palm-tree, I will take hold of the branches thereof: Let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine, And the smell of thy breath like apples,	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	7	9	And thy mouth like the best wine, That goeth down smoothly for my beloved, Gliding through the lips of those that are asleep.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	7	10	I am my beloveds; And his desire is toward me.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	7	11	Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; Let us lodge in the villages.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	7	12	Let us get up early to the vineyards; Let us see whether the vine hath budded, And its blossom is open, And the pomegranates are in flower: There will I give thee my love.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	7	13	The mandrakes give forth fragrance; And at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and old, Which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	8	1	Oh that thou wert as my brother, That sucked the breasts of my mother! When I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; Yea, and none would despise me.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	8	2	I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mothers house, Who would instruct me; I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine, Of the juice of my pomegranate.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	8	3	His left hand should be under my head, And his right hand should embrace me.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	8	4	I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, That ye stir not up, nor awake my love, Until he please.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	8	5	Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, Leaning upon her beloved? Under the apple-tree I awakened thee: There thy mother was in travail with thee, There was she in travail that brought thee forth.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	8	6	Set me as a seal upon thy heart, As a seal upon thine arm: For love is strong as death; Jealousy is cruel as Sheol; The flashes thereof are flashes of fire, A very flame of Jehovah.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	8	7	Many waters cannot quench love, Neither can floods drown it: If a man would give all the substance of his house for love, He would utterly be contemned.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	8	8	We have a little sister, And she hath no breasts: What shall we do for our sister In the day when she shall be spoken for?	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	8	9	If she be a wall, We will build upon her a turret of silver: And if she be a door, We will inclose her with boards of cedar.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	8	10	I am a wall, and my breasts like the towers thereof Then was I in his eyes as one that found peace.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	8	11	Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; He let out the vineyard unto keepers; Every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	8	12	My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: Thou, O Solomon, shalt have the thousand, And those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	8	13	Thou that dwellest in the gardens, The companions hearken for thy voice: Cause me to hear it.	22
ASV	Song of Solomon	8	14	Make haste, my beloved, And be thou like to a roe or to a young hart Upon the mountains of spices.	22
ASV	Isaiah	1	1	The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	2	Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for Jehovah hath spoken: I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	3	The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his masters crib; but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	4	Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, children that deal corruptly! they have forsaken Jehovah, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they are estranged and gone backward.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	5	Why will ye be still stricken, that ye revolt more and more? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	6	From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and fresh stripes: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with oil.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	7	Your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	8	And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	9	Except Jehovah of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	10	Hear the word of Jehovah, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	11	What unto me is the multitude of your sacrifices? saith Jehovah: I have had enough of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	12	When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample my courts?	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	13	Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; new moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies,- I cannot away with iniquity and the solemn meeting.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	14	Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth; they are a trouble unto me; I am weary of bearing them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	15	And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	16	Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	17	learn to do well; seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	18	Come now, and let us reason together, saith Jehovah: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	19	If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	20	but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	21	How is the faithful city become a harlot! she that was full of justice! righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	22	Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	23	Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves; every one loveth bribes, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	24	Therefore saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies;	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	25	and I will turn my hand upon thee, and thoroughly purge away thy dross, and will take away all thy tin;	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	26	and I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called The city of righteousness, a faithful town.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	27	Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her converts with righteousness.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	28	But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together, and they that forsake Jehovah shall be consumed.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	29	For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	30	For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.	23
ASV	Isaiah	1	31	And the strong shall be as tow, and his work as a spark; and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	2	1	The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.	23
ASV	Isaiah	2	2	And it shall come to pass in the latter days, that the mountain of Jehovahs house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	2	3	And many peoples shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah fro	23
ASV	Isaiah	2	4	And he will judge between the nations, and will decide concerning many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.	23
ASV	Isaiah	2	5	O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of Jehovah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	2	6	For thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they are filled with customs from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they strike hands with the children of foreigners.	23
ASV	Isaiah	2	7	And their land is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land also is full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots.	23
ASV	Isaiah	2	8	Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.	23
ASV	Isaiah	2	9	And the mean man is bowed down, and the great man is brought low: therefore forgive them not.	23
ASV	Isaiah	2	10	Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty.	23
ASV	Isaiah	2	11	The lofty looks of man shall be brought low, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.	23
ASV	Isaiah	2	12	For there shall be a day of Jehovah of hosts upon all that is proud and haughty, and upon all that is lifted up; and it shall be brought low;	23
ASV	Isaiah	2	13	and upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,	23
ASV	Isaiah	2	14	and upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up,	23
ASV	Isaiah	2	15	and upon every lofty tower, and upon every fortified wall,	23
ASV	Isaiah	2	16	and upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant imagery.	23
ASV	Isaiah	2	17	And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low; and Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.	23
ASV	Isaiah	2	18	And the idols shall utterly pass away.	23
ASV	Isaiah	2	19	And men shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes of the earth, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake mightily the earth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	2	20	In that day men shall cast away their idols of silver, and their idols of gold, which have been made for them to worship, to the moles and to the bats;	23
ASV	Isaiah	2	21	to go into the caverns of the rocks, and into the clefts of the ragged rocks, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake mightily the earth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	2	22	Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein is he to be accounted of?	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	1	For, behold, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah stay and staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water;	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	2	the mighty man, and the man of war; the judge, and the prophet, and the diviner, and the elder;	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	3	the captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counsellor, and the expert artificer, and the skilful enchanter.	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	4	And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	5	And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbor: the child shall behave himself proudly against the old man, and the base against the honorable.	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	6	When a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand;	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	7	in that day shall he lift up his voice, saying, I will not be a healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: ye shall not make me ruler of the people.	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	8	For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; because their tongue and their doings are against Jehovah, to provoke the eyes of his glory.	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	9	The show of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have done evil unto themselves.	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	10	Say ye of the righteous, that it shall be well with him; for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	11	Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him; for what his hands have done shall be done unto him.	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	12	As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they that lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	13	Jehovah standeth up to contend, and standeth to judge the peoples.	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	14	Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, and the princes thereof: It is ye that have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses:	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	15	what mean ye that ye crush my people, and grind the face of the poor? saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	16	Moreover Jehovah said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet;	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	17	therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and Jehovah will lay bare their secret parts.	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	18	In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, and the cauls, and the crescents;	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	19	the pendants, and the bracelets, and the mufflers;	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	20	the headtires, and the ankle chains, and the sashes, and the perfume-boxes, and the amulets;	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	21	the rings, and the nose-jewels;	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	22	the festival robes, and the mantles, and the shawls, and the satchels;	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	23	the hand-mirrors, and the fine linen, and the turbans, and the veils.	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	24	And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet spices there shall be rottenness; and instead of a girdle, a rope; and instead of well set hair, baldness; and instead of a robe, a girding of sackcloth; branding instead of beauty.	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	25	Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.	23
ASV	Isaiah	3	26	And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall be desolate and sit upon the ground.	23
ASV	Isaiah	4	1	And seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name; take thou away our reproach.	23
ASV	Isaiah	4	2	In that day shall the branch of Jehovah be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.	23
ASV	Isaiah	4	3	And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem;	23
ASV	Isaiah	4	4	when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof, by the spirit of justice, and by the spirit of burning.	23
ASV	Isaiah	4	5	And Jehovah will create over the whole habitation of mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be spread a covering.	23
ASV	Isaiah	4	6	And there shall be a pavilion for a shade in the day-time from the heat, and for a refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain.	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	1	Let me sing for my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	2	and he digged it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	3	And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	4	What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	5	And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; I will break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	6	and I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor hoed; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	7	For the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for justice, but, behold, oppression; for righteousness, but, behold, a cry.	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	8	Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no room, and ye be made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	9	In mine ears saith Jehovah of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	10	For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield but an ephah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	11	Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that tarry late into the night, till wine inflame them!	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	12	And the harp and the lute, the tabret and the pipe, and wine, are in their feasts; but they regard not the work of Jehovah, neither have they considered the operation of his hands.	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	13	Therefore my people are gone into captivity for lack of knowledge; and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude are parched with thirst.	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	14	Therefore Sheol hath enlarged its desire, and opened its mouth without measure; and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth among them, descend into it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	15	And the mean man is bowed down, and the great man is humbled, and the eyes of the lofty are humbled:	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	16	but Jehovah of hosts is exalted in justice, and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	17	Then shall the lambs feed as in their pasture, and the waste places of the fat ones shall wanderers eat.	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	18	Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, and sin as it were with a cart rope;	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	19	that say, Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	20	Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	21	Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	22	Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink;	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	23	that justify the wicked for a bribe, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	24	Therefore as the tongue of fire devoureth the stubble, and as the dry grass sinketh down in the flame, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust; because they have rejected the law of Jehovah of hosts, and despised the wo	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	25	Therefore is the anger of Jehovah kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them; and the mountains tremble, and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is n	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	26	And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss for them from the end of the earth; and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly.	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	27	None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	28	whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses hoofs shall be accounted as flint, and their wheels as a whirlwind:	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	29	their roaring shall be like a lioness, they shall roar like young lions; yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and there shall be none to deliver.	23
ASV	Isaiah	5	30	And they shall roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold, darkness and distress; and the light is darkened in the clouds thereof.	23
ASV	Isaiah	6	1	In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.	23
ASV	Isaiah	6	2	Above him stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.	23
ASV	Isaiah	6	3	And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.	23
ASV	Isaiah	6	4	And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.	23
ASV	Isaiah	6	5	Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts.	23
ASV	Isaiah	6	6	Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:	23
ASV	Isaiah	6	7	and he touched my mouth with it, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin forgiven.	23
ASV	Isaiah	6	8	And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I; send me.	23
ASV	Isaiah	6	9	And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.	23
ASV	Isaiah	6	10	Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they sea with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed.	23
ASV	Isaiah	6	11	Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste,	23
ASV	Isaiah	6	12	and Jehovah have removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land.	23
ASV	Isaiah	6	13	And if there be yet a tenth in it, it also shall in turn be eaten up: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remaineth, when they are felled; so the holy seed is the stock thereof.	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	1	And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	2	And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	3	Then said Jehovah unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fullers field;	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	4	and say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither let thy heart be faint, because of these two tails of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	5	Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have purposed evil against thee, saying,	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	6	Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set up a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeel;	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	7	thus saith the Lord Jehovah, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	8	For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken in pieces, so that is shall not be a people:	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	9	and the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliahs son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	10	And Jehovah spake again unto Ahaz, saying,	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	11	Ask thee a sign of Jehovah thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	12	But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt Jehovah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	13	And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David: Is it a small thing for you to weary men, that ye will weary my God also?	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	14	Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	15	Butter and honey shall he eat, when he knoweth to refuse the evil, and choose the good.	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	16	For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land whose two kings thou abhorrest shall be forsaken.	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	17	Jehovah will bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy fathers house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah-even the king of Assyria.	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	18	And it shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah will hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	19	And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the clefts of the rocks, and upon all thorn-hedges, and upon all pastures.	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	20	In that day will the Lord shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River, even with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also consume the beard.	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	21	And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall keep alive a young cow, and two sheep;	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	22	and it shall come to pass, that because of the abundance of milk which they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the midst of the land.	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	23	And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, shall be for briers and thorns.	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	24	With arrows and with bow shall one come thither, because all the land shall be briers and thorns.	23
ASV	Isaiah	7	25	And all the hills that were digged with the mattock, thou shalt not come thither for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of sheep.	23
ASV	Isaiah	8	1	And Jehovah said unto me, Take thee a great tablet, and write upon it with the pen of a man, For Maher-shalal-hash-baz;	23
ASV	Isaiah	8	2	and I will take unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	8	3	And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said Jehovah unto me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz.	23
ASV	Isaiah	8	4	For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and, My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be carried away before the king of Assyria.	23
ASV	Isaiah	8	5	And Jehovah spake unto me yet again, saying,	23
ASV	Isaiah	8	6	Forasmuch as this people have refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliahs son;	23
ASV	Isaiah	8	7	now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the River, strong and many, even the king of Assyria and all his glory: and it shall come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks;	23
ASV	Isaiah	8	8	and it shall sweep onward into Judah; it shall overflow and pass through; it shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of its wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.	23
ASV	Isaiah	8	9	Make an uproar, O ye peoples, and be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and be broken in pieces.	23
ASV	Isaiah	8	10	Take counsel together, and it shall be brought to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.	23
ASV	Isaiah	8	11	For Jehovah spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,	23
ASV	Isaiah	8	12	Say ye not, A conspiracy, concerning all whereof this people shall say, A conspiracy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be in dread thereof.	23
ASV	Isaiah	8	13	Jehovah of hosts, him shall ye sanctify; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.	23
ASV	Isaiah	8	14	And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.	23
ASV	Isaiah	8	15	And many shall stumble thereon, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.	23
ASV	Isaiah	8	16	Bind thou up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.	23
ASV	Isaiah	8	17	And I will wait for Jehovah, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.	23
ASV	Isaiah	8	18	Behold, I and the children whom Jehovah hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Jehovah of hosts, who dwelleth in mount Zion.	23
ASV	Isaiah	8	19	And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits and unto the wizards, that chirp and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? on behalf of the living should they seek unto the dead?	23
ASV	Isaiah	8	20	To the law and to the testimony! if they speak not according to this word, surely there is no morning for them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	8	21	And they shall pass through it, sore distressed and hungry; and it shall come to pass that, when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse by their king and by their God, and turn their faces upward:	23
ASV	Isaiah	8	22	and they shall look unto the earth, and behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish; and into thick darkness they shall be driven away.	23
ASV	Isaiah	9	1	But there shall be no gloom to her that was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali; but in the latter time hath he made it glorious, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nat	23
ASV	Isaiah	9	2	The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.	23
ASV	Isaiah	9	3	Thou hast multiplied the nation, thou hast increased their joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.	23
ASV	Isaiah	9	4	For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, thou hast broken as in the day of Midian.	23
ASV	Isaiah	9	5	For all the armor of the armed man in the tumult, and the garments rolled in blood, shall be for burning, for fuel of fire.	23
ASV	Isaiah	9	6	For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.	23
ASV	Isaiah	9	7	Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will pe	23
ASV	Isaiah	9	8	The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.	23
ASV	Isaiah	9	9	And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in pride and in stoutness of heart,	23
ASV	Isaiah	9	10	The bricks are fallen, but we will build with hewn stone; the sycomores are cut down, but we will put cedars in their place.	23
ASV	Isaiah	9	11	Therefore Jehovah will set up on high against him the adversaries of Rezin, and will stir up his enemies,	23
ASV	Isaiah	9	12	the Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.	23
ASV	Isaiah	9	13	Yet the people have not turned unto him that smote them, neither have they sought Jehovah of hosts.	23
ASV	Isaiah	9	14	Therefore Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, palm-branch and rush, in one day.	23
ASV	Isaiah	9	15	The elder and the honorable man, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.	23
ASV	Isaiah	9	16	For they that lead this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.	23
ASV	Isaiah	9	17	Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men, neither will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows; for every one is profane and an evil-doer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is	23
ASV	Isaiah	9	18	For wickedness burneth as the fire; it devoureth the briers and thorns; yea, it kindleth in the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in a column of smoke.	23
ASV	Isaiah	9	19	Through the wrath of Jehovah of hosts is the land burnt up; and the people are as the fuel of fire: no man spareth his brother.	23
ASV	Isaiah	9	20	And one shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:	23
ASV	Isaiah	9	21	Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	1	Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and to the writers that write perverseness;	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	2	to turn aside the needy from justice, and to rob the poor of my people of their right, that widows may be their spoil, and that they may make the fatherless their prey!	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	3	And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	4	They shall only bow down under the prisoners, and shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	5	Ho Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, the staff in whose hand is mine indignation!	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	6	I will send him against a profane nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	7	Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few.	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	8	For he saith, Are not my princes all of them kings?	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	9	Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	10	As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	11	shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	12	Wherefore it shall come to pass, that, when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	13	For he hath said, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I have understanding: and I have removed the bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures, and like a valiant man I have brought down them that sit on thrones:	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	14	and my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the peoples; and as one gathereth eggs that are forsaken, have I gathered all the earth: and there was none that moved the wing, or that opened the mouth, or chirped.	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	15	Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? shall the saw magnify itself against him that wieldeth it? as if a rod should wield them that lift it up, or as if a staff should lift up him that is not wood.	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	16	Therefore will the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory there shall be kindled a burning like the burning of fire.	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	17	And the light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame; and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day.	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	18	And he will consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and it shall be as when a standard-bearer fainteth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	19	And the remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few, so that a child may write them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	20	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and they that are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again lean upon him that smote them, but shall lean upon Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	21	A remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	22	For though thy people, Israel, be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them shall return: a destruction is determined, overflowing with righteousness.	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	23	For a full end, and that determined, will the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, make in the midst of all the earth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	24	Therefore thus saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian, though he smite thee with the rod, and lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	25	For yet a very little while, and the indignation against thee shall be accomplished, and mine anger shall be directed to his destruction.	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	26	And Jehovah of hosts will stir up against him a scourge, as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and his rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it up after the manner of Egypt.	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	27	And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall depart from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed by reason of fatness.	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	28	He is come to Aiath, he is passed through Migron; at Michmash he layeth up his baggage;	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	29	they are gone over the pass; they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah trembleth; Gibeah of Saul is fled.	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	30	Cry aloud with thy voice, O daughter of Gallim! hearken, O Laishah! O thou poor Anathoth!	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	31	Madmenah is a fugitive; the inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	32	This very day shall he halt at Nob: he shaketh his hand at the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	33	Behold, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, will lop the boughs with terror: and the high of stature shall be hewn down, and the lofty shall be brought low.	23
ASV	Isaiah	10	34	And he will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.	23
ASV	Isaiah	11	1	And there shall come forth a shoot out of the stock of Jesse, and a branch out of his roots shall bear fruit.	23
ASV	Isaiah	11	2	And the Spirit of Jehovah shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	11	3	And his delight shall be in the fear of Jehovah; and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither decide after the hearing of his ears;	23
ASV	Isaiah	11	4	but with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth; and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.	23
ASV	Isaiah	11	5	And righteousness shall be the girdle of his waist, and faithfulness the girdle of his loins.	23
ASV	Isaiah	11	6	And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	11	7	And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.	23
ASV	Isaiah	11	8	And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adders den.	23
ASV	Isaiah	11	9	They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.	23
ASV	Isaiah	11	10	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the root of Jesse, that standeth for an ensign of the peoples, unto him shall the nations seek; and his resting-place shall be glorious.	23
ASV	Isaiah	11	11	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord will set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, that shall remain, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from H	23
ASV	Isaiah	11	12	And he will set up an ensign for the nations, and will assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	11	13	The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and they that vex Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim.	23
ASV	Isaiah	11	14	And they shall fly down upon the shoulder of the Philistines on the west; together shall they despoil the children of the east: they shall put forth their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	11	15	And Jehovah will utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his scorching wind will he wave his hand over the River, and will smite it into seven streams, and cause men to march over dryshod.	23
ASV	Isaiah	11	16	And there shall be a highway for the remnant of his people, that shall remain, from Assyria; like as there was for Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.	23
ASV	Isaiah	12	1	And in that day thou shalt say, I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah; for though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away and thou comfortest me.	23
ASV	Isaiah	12	2	Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid; for Jehovah, even Jehovah, is my strength and song; and he is become my salvation.	23
ASV	Isaiah	12	3	Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.	23
ASV	Isaiah	12	4	And in that day shall ye say, Give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name, declare his doings among the peoples, make mention that his name is exalted.	23
ASV	Isaiah	12	5	Sing unto Jehovah; for he hath done excellent things: let this be known in all the earth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	12	6	Cry aloud and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion; for great in the midst of thee is the Holy One of Israel.	23
ASV	Isaiah	13	1	The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.	23
ASV	Isaiah	13	2	Set ye up an ensign upon the bare mountain, lift up the voice unto them, wave the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.	23
ASV	Isaiah	13	3	I have commanded my consecrated ones, yea, I have called my mighty men for mine anger, even my proudly exulting ones.	23
ASV	Isaiah	13	4	The noise of a multitude in the mountains, as of a great people! the noise of a tumult of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together! Jehovah of hosts is mustering the host for the battle.	23
ASV	Isaiah	13	5	They come from a far country, from the uttermost part of heaven, even Jehovah, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.	23
ASV	Isaiah	13	6	Wail ye; for the day of Jehovah is at hand; as destruction from the Almighty shall it come.	23
ASV	Isaiah	13	7	Therefore shall all hands be feeble, and every heart of man shall melt:	23
ASV	Isaiah	13	8	and they shall be dismayed; pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman in travail: they shall look in amazement one at another; their faces shall be faces of flame.	23
ASV	Isaiah	13	9	Behold, the day of Jehovah cometh, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger; to make the land a desolation, and to destroy the sinners thereof out of it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	13	10	For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light; the sun shall be darkened in its going forth, and the moon shall not cause its light to shine.	23
ASV	Isaiah	13	11	And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity: and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.	23
ASV	Isaiah	13	12	I will make a man more rare than fine gold, even a man than the pure gold of Ophir.	23
ASV	Isaiah	13	13	Therefore I will make the heavens to tremble, and the earth shall be shaken out of its place, in the wrath of Jehovah of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.	23
ASV	Isaiah	13	14	And it shall come to pass, that as the chased roe, and as sheep that no man gathereth, they shall turn every man to his own people, and shall flee every man to his own land.	23
ASV	Isaiah	13	15	Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is taken shall fall by the sword.	23
ASV	Isaiah	13	16	Their infants also shall be dashed in pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be rifled, and their wives ravished.	23
ASV	Isaiah	13	17	Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who shall not regard silver, and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	13	18	And their bows shall dash the young men in pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children.	23
ASV	Isaiah	13	19	And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans pride, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	13	20	It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall shepherds make their flocks to lie down there.	23
ASV	Isaiah	13	21	But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and ostriches shall dwell there, and wild goats shall dance there.	23
ASV	Isaiah	13	22	And wolves shall cry in their castles, and jackals in the pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	1	For Jehovah will have compassion on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land: and the sojourner shall join himself with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	2	And the peoples shall take them, and bring them to their place; and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of Jehovah for servants and for handmaids: and they shall take them captive whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their opp	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	3	And it shall come to pass in the day that Jehovah shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy trouble, and from the hard service wherein thou wast made to serve,	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	4	that thou shalt take up this parable against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	5	Jehovah hath broken the staff of the wicked, the sceptre of the rulers;	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	6	that smote the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke, that ruled the nations in anger, with a persecution that none restrained.	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	7	The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing.	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	8	Yea, the fir-trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since thou art laid low, no hewer is come up against us.	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	9	Sheol from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming; it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	10	All they shall answer and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	11	Thy pomp is brought down to Sheol, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and worms cover thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	12	How art thou fallen from heaven, O day-star, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, that didst lay low the nations!	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	13	And thou saidst in thy heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; and I will sit upon the mount of congregation, in the uttermost parts of the north;	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	14	I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	15	Yet thou shalt be brought down to Sheol, to the uttermost parts of the pit.	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	16	They that see thee shall gaze at thee, they shall consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms;	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	17	that made the world as a wilderness, and overthrew the cities thereof; that let not loose his prisoners to their home?	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	18	All the kings of the nations, all of them, sleep in glory, every one in his own house.	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	19	But thou art cast forth away from thy sepulchre like an abominable branch, clothed with the slain, that are thrust through with the sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a dead body trodden under foot.	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	20	Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, thou hast slain thy people; the seed of evil-doers shall not be named for ever.	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	21	Prepare ye slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers, that they rise not up, and possess the earth, and fill the face of the world with cities.	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	22	And I will rise up against them, saith Jehovah of hosts, and cut off from Babylon name and remnant, and son and sons son, saith Jehovah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	23	I will also make it a possession for the porcupine, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith Jehovah of hosts.	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	24	Jehovah of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely, as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand:	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	25	that I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulder.	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	26	This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth; and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	27	For Jehovah of hosts hath purposed, and who shall annul it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	28	In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	29	Rejoice not, O Philistia, all of thee, because the rod that smote thee is broken; for out of the serpents root shall come forth an adder, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	30	And the first-born of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety; and I will kill thy root with famine, and thy remnant shall be slain.	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	31	Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou art melted away, O Philistia, all of thee; for there cometh a smoke out of the north, and there is no straggler in his ranks.	23
ASV	Isaiah	14	32	What then shall one answer the messengers of the nation? That Jehovah hath founded Zion, and in her shall the afflicted of his people take refuge.	23
ASV	Isaiah	15	1	The burden of Moab. For in a night Ar of Moab is laid waste, and brought to nought; for in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to nought.	23
ASV	Isaiah	15	2	They are gone up to Bayith, and to Dibon, to the high places, to weep: Moab waileth over Nebo, and over Medeba; on all their heads is baldness, every beard is cut off.	23
ASV	Isaiah	15	3	In their streets they gird themselves with sackcloth; on their housetops, and in their broad places, every one waileth, weeping abundantly.	23
ASV	Isaiah	15	4	And Heshbon crieth out, and Elealeh; their voice is heard even unto Jahaz: therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud; his soul trembleth within him.	23
ASV	Isaiah	15	5	My heart crieth out for Moab; her nobles flee unto Zoar, to Eglath-shelishi-yah: for by the ascent of Luhith with weeping they go up; for in the way of Horonaim they raise up a cry of destruction.	23
ASV	Isaiah	15	6	For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate; for the grass is withered away, the tender grass faileth, there is no green thing.	23
ASV	Isaiah	15	7	Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away over the brook of the willows.	23
ASV	Isaiah	15	8	For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the wailing thereof unto Eglaim, and the wailing thereof unto Beer-elim.	23
ASV	Isaiah	15	9	For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; for I will bring yet more upon Dimon, a lion upon them of Moab that escape, and upon the remnant of the land.	23
ASV	Isaiah	16	1	Send ye the lambs for the ruler of the land from Selah to the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.	23
ASV	Isaiah	16	2	For it shall be that, as wandering birds, as a scattered nest, so shall the daughters of Moab be at the fords of the Arnon.	23
ASV	Isaiah	16	3	Give counsel, execute justice; make thy shade as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; betray not the fugitive.	23
ASV	Isaiah	16	4	Let mine outcasts dwell with thee; as for Moab, be thou a covert to him from the face of the destroyer. For the extortioner is brought to nought, destruction ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.	23
ASV	Isaiah	16	5	And a throne shall be established in lovingkindness; and one shall sit thereon in truth, in the tent of David, judging, and seeking justice, and swift to do righteousness.	23
ASV	Isaiah	16	6	We have heard of the pride of Moab, that he is very proud; even of his arrogancy, and his pride, and his wrath; his boastings are nought.	23
ASV	Isaiah	16	7	Therefore shall Moab wail for Moab, every one shall wail: for the raisin-cakes of Kir-hareseth shall ye mourn, utterly stricken.	23
ASV	Isaiah	16	8	For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah; the lords of the nations have broken down the choice branches thereof, which reached even unto Jazer, which wandered into the wilderness; its shoots were spread abroad, they passed over the sea.	23
ASV	Isaiah	16	9	Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah; I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for upon thy summer fruits and upon thy harvest the battle shout is fallen.	23
ASV	Isaiah	16	10	And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the fruitful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither joyful noise: no treader shall tread out wine in the presses; I have made the vintage shout to cease.	23
ASV	Isaiah	16	11	Wherefore my heart soundeth like a harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kir-heres.	23
ASV	Isaiah	16	12	And it shall come to pass, when Moab presenteth himself, when he wearieth himself upon the high place, and shall come to his sanctuary to pray, that he shall not prevail.	23
ASV	Isaiah	16	13	This is the word that Jehovah spake concerning Moab in time past.	23
ASV	Isaiah	16	14	But now Jehovah hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of a hireling, the glory of Moab shall be brought into contempt, with all his great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and of no account.	23
ASV	Isaiah	17	1	The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.	23
ASV	Isaiah	17	2	The cities of Aroer are forsaken; they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.	23
ASV	Isaiah	17	3	And the fortress shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria; they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith Jehovah of hosts.	23
ASV	Isaiah	17	4	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the glory of Jacob shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean.	23
ASV	Isaiah	17	5	And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the standing grain, and his arm reapeth the ears; yea, it shall be as when one gleaneth ears in the valley of Rephaim.	23
ASV	Isaiah	17	6	Yet there shall be left therein gleanings, as the shaking of an olive-tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outmost branches of a fruitful tree, saith Jehovah, the God of Israel.	23
ASV	Isaiah	17	7	In that day shall men look unto their Maker, and their eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel.	23
ASV	Isaiah	17	8	And they shall not look to the altars, the work of their hands; neither shall they have respect to that which their fingers have made, either the Asherim, or the sun-images.	23
ASV	Isaiah	17	9	In that day shall their strong cities be as the forsaken places in the wood and on the mountain top, which were forsaken from before the children of Israel; and it shall be a desolation.	23
ASV	Isaiah	17	10	For thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength; therefore thou plantest pleasant plants, and settest it with strange slips.	23
ASV	Isaiah	17	11	In the day of thy planting thou hedgest it in, and in the morning thou makest thy seed to blossom; but the harvest fleeth away in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.	23
ASV	Isaiah	17	12	Ah, the uproar of many peoples, that roar like the roaring of the seas; and the rushing of nations, that rush like the rushing of mighty waters!	23
ASV	Isaiah	17	13	The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but he shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like the whirling dust before the storm.	23
ASV	Isaiah	17	14	At eventide, behold, terror; and before the morning they are not. This is the portion of them that despoil us, and the lot of them that rob us.	23
ASV	Isaiah	18	1	Ah, the land of the rustling of wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia;	23
ASV	Isaiah	18	2	that sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of papyrus upon the waters, saying, Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, to a people terrible from their beginning onward, a nation that meteth out and treadeth down, whose land the riv	23
ASV	Isaiah	18	3	All ye inhabitants of the world, and ye dwellers on the earth, when an ensign is lifted up on the mountains, see ye; and when the trumpet is blown, hear ye.	23
ASV	Isaiah	18	4	For thus hath Jehovah said unto me, I will be still, and I will behold in my dwelling-place, like clear heat in sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.	23
ASV	Isaiah	18	5	For before the harvest, when the blossom is over, and the flower becometh a ripening grape, he will cut off the sprigs with pruning-hooks, and the spreading branches will he take away and cut down.	23
ASV	Isaiah	18	6	They shall be left together unto the ravenous birds of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth; and the ravenous birds shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	18	7	In that time shall a present be brought unto Jehovah of hosts from a people tall and smooth, even from a people terrible from their beginning onward, a nation that meteth out and treadeth down, whose land the rivers divide, to the place of the name of Jeh	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	1	The burden of Egypt. Behold, Jehovah rideth upon a swift cloud, and cometh unto Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall tremble at his presence; and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	2	And I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbor; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	3	And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst of it; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek unto the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	4	And I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	5	And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and become dry.	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	6	And the rivers shall become foul; the streams of Egypt shall be diminished and dried up; the reeds and flags shall wither away.	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	7	The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all the sown fields of the Nile, shall become dry, be driven away, and be no more.	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	8	And the fishers shall lament, and all they that cast angle into the Nile shall mourn, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	9	Moreover they that work in combed flax, and they that weave white cloth, shall be confounded.	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	10	And the pillars of Egypt shall be broken in pieces; all they that work for hire shall be grieved in soul.	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	11	The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish; the counsel of the wisest counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	12	Where then are thy wise men? and let them tell thee now; and let them know what Jehovah of hosts hath purposed concerning Egypt.	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	13	The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Memphis are deceived; they have caused Egypt to go astray, that are the corner-stone of her tribes.	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	14	Jehovah hath mingled a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her; and they have caused Egypt to go astray in every work thereof, as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit.	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	15	Neither shall there be for Egypt any work, which head or tail, palm-branch or rush, may do.	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	16	In that day shall the Egyptians be like unto women; and they shall tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Jehovah of hosts, which he shaketh over them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	17	And the land of Judah shall become a terror unto Egypt; every one to whom mention is made thereof shall be afraid, because of the purpose of Jehovah of hosts, which he purposeth against it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	18	In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and swear to Jehovah of hosts; one shall be called The city of destruction.	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	19	In that day shall there be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to Jehovah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	20	And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto Jehovah of hosts in the land of Egypt; for they shall cry unto Jehovah because of oppressors, and he will send them a saviour, and a defender, and he will deliver them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	21	And Jehovah shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know Jehovah in that day; yea, they shall worship with sacrifice and oblation, and shall vow a vow unto Jehovah, and shall perform it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	22	And Jehovah will smite Egypt, smiting and healing; and they shall return unto Jehovah, and he will be entreated of them, and will heal them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	23	In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians shall worship with the Assyrians.	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	24	In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth;	23
ASV	Isaiah	19	25	for that Jehovah of hosts hath blessed them, saying, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance.	23
ASV	Isaiah	20	1	In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and took it;	23
ASV	Isaiah	20	2	at that time Jehovah spake by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go, and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put thy shoe from off thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.	23
ASV	Isaiah	20	3	And Jehovah said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder concerning Egypt and concerning Ethiopia;	23
ASV	Isaiah	20	4	so shall the king of Assyria lead away the captives of Egypt, and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.	23
ASV	Isaiah	20	5	And they shall be dismayed and confounded, because of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.	23
ASV	Isaiah	20	6	And the inhabitant of this coast-land shall say in that day, Behold, such is our expectation, whither we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria: and we, how shall we escape?	23
ASV	Isaiah	21	1	The burden of the wilderness of the sea. As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it cometh from the wilderness, from a terrible land.	23
ASV	Isaiah	21	2	A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous man dealeth treacherously, and the destroyer destroyeth. Go up, O Elam; besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.	23
ASV	Isaiah	21	3	Therefore are my loins filled with anguish; pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman in travail: I am pained so that I cannot hear; I am dismayed so that I cannot see.	23
ASV	Isaiah	21	4	My heart fluttereth, horror hath affrighted me; the twilight that I desired hath been turned into trembling unto me.	23
ASV	Isaiah	21	5	They prepare the table, they set the watch, they eat, they drink: rise up, ye princes, anoint the shield.	23
ASV	Isaiah	21	6	For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman: let him declare what he seeth:	23
ASV	Isaiah	21	7	and when he seeth a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of asses, a troop of camels, he shall hearken diligently with much heed.	23
ASV	Isaiah	21	8	And he cried as a lion: O Lord, I stand continually upon the watch-tower in the day-time, and am set in my ward whole nights;	23
ASV	Isaiah	21	9	and, behold, here cometh a troop of men, horsemen in pairs. And he answered and said, Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the graven images of her gods are broken unto the ground.	23
ASV	Isaiah	21	10	O thou my threshing, and the grain of my floor! that which I have heard from Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.	23
ASV	Isaiah	21	11	The burden of Dumah. One calleth unto me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?	23
ASV	Isaiah	21	12	The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will inquire, inquire ye: turn ye, come.	23
ASV	Isaiah	21	13	The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye caravans of Dedanites.	23
ASV	Isaiah	21	14	Unto him that was thirsty they brought water; the inhabitants of the land of Tema did meet the fugitives with their bread.	23
ASV	Isaiah	21	15	For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.	23
ASV	Isaiah	21	16	For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, all the glory of Kedar shall fail;	23
ASV	Isaiah	21	17	and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be few; for Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath spoken it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	1	The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops?	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	2	O thou that art full of shoutings, a tumultuous city, a joyous town; thy slain are not slain with the sword, neither are they dead in battle.	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	3	All thy rulers fled away together, they were bound by the archers; all that were found of thee were bound together; they fled afar off.	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	4	Therefore said I, Look away from me, I will weep bitterly; labor not to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people.	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	5	For it is a day of discomfiture, and of treading down, and of perplexity, from the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, in the valley of vision; a breaking down of the walls, and a crying to the mountains.	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	6	And Elam bare the quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen; and Kir uncovered the shield.	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	7	And it came to pass, that thy choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate.	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	8	And he took away the covering of Judah; and thou didst look in that day to the armor in the house of the forest.	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	9	And ye saw the breaches of the city of David, that they were many; and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool;	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	10	and ye numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and ye brake down the houses to fortify the wall;	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	11	ye made also a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But ye looked not unto him that had done this, neither had ye respect unto him that purposed it long ago.	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	12	And in that day did the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	13	and behold, joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine: let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we shall die.	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	14	And Jehovah of hosts revealed himself in mine ears, Surely this iniquity shall not be forgiven you till ye die, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	15	Thus saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, Go, get thee unto this treasurer, even unto Shebna, who is over the house, and say,	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	16	What doest thou here? and whom has thou here, that thou hast hewed thee out here a sepulchre? hewing him out a sepulchre on high, graving a habitation for himself in the rock!	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	17	Behold, Jehovah, like a strong man, will hurl thee away violently; yea, he will wrap thee up closely.	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	18	He will surely wind thee round and round, and toss thee like a ball into a large country; there shalt thou die, and there shall be the chariots of thy glory, thou shame of thy lords house.	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	19	And I will thrust thee from thine office; and from thy station shalt thou be pulled down.	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	20	And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	21	and I will cloth him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand; and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	22	And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; and he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	23	And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a throne of glory to his fathers house.	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	24	And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his fathers house, the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups even to all the flagons.	23
ASV	Isaiah	22	25	In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, shall the nail that was fastened in a sure place give way; and it shall be hewn down, and fall; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off; for Jehovah hath spoken it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	23	1	The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of Kittim it is revealed to them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	23	2	Be still, ye inhabitants of the coast, thou whom the merchants of Sidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.	23
ASV	Isaiah	23	3	And on great waters the seed of the Shihor, the harvest of the Nile, was her revenue; and she was the mart of nations.	23
ASV	Isaiah	23	4	Be thou ashamed, O Sidon; for the sea hath spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, I have not travailed, nor brought forth, neither have I nourished young men, nor brought up virgins.	23
ASV	Isaiah	23	5	When the report cometh to Egypt, they shall be sorely pained at the report of Tyre.	23
ASV	Isaiah	23	6	Pass ye over to Tarshish; wail, ye inhabitants of the coast.	23
ASV	Isaiah	23	7	Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days, whose feet carried her afar off to sojourn?	23
ASV	Isaiah	23	8	Who hath purposed this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth?	23
ASV	Isaiah	23	9	Jehovah of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	23	10	Pass through thy land as the Nile, O daughter of Tarshish; there is no restraint any more.	23
ASV	Isaiah	23	11	He hath stretched out his hand over the sea, he hath shaken the kingdoms: Jehovah hath given commandment concerning Canaan, to destroy the strongholds thereof.	23
ASV	Isaiah	23	12	And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon: arise, pass over to Kittim; even there shalt thou have no rest.	23
ASV	Isaiah	23	13	Behold, the land of the Chaldeans: this people was not; the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness; they set up their towers; they overthrew the palaces thereof; they made it a ruin.	23
ASV	Isaiah	23	14	Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for your stronghold is laid waste.	23
ASV	Isaiah	23	15	And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of seventy years it shall be unto Tyre as in the song of the harlot.	23
ASV	Isaiah	23	16	Take a harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered.	23
ASV	Isaiah	23	17	And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that Jehovah will visit Tyre, and she shall return to her hire, and shall play the harlot with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	23	18	And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to Jehovah: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before Jehovah, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.	23
ASV	Isaiah	24	1	Behold, Jehovah maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.	23
ASV	Isaiah	24	2	And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the creditor, so with the debtor; as with the taker of interest, so wi	23
ASV	Isaiah	24	3	The earth shall be utterly emptied, and utterly laid waste; for Jehovah hath spoken this word.	23
ASV	Isaiah	24	4	The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the lofty people of the earth do languish.	23
ASV	Isaiah	24	5	The earth also is polluted under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, broken the everlasting covenant.	23
ASV	Isaiah	24	6	Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are found guilty: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.	23
ASV	Isaiah	24	7	The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merry-hearted do sigh.	23
ASV	Isaiah	24	8	The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	24	9	They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	24	10	The waste city is broken down; every house is shut up, that no man may come in.	23
ASV	Isaiah	24	11	There is a crying in the streets because of the wine; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.	23
ASV	Isaiah	24	12	In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.	23
ASV	Isaiah	24	13	For thus shall it be in the midst of the earth among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive-tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done.	23
ASV	Isaiah	24	14	These shall lift up their voice, they shall shout; for the majesty of Jehovah they cry aloud from the sea.	23
ASV	Isaiah	24	15	Wherefore glorify ye Jehovah in the east, even the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the isles of the sea.	23
ASV	Isaiah	24	16	From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs: Glory to the righteous. But I said, I pine away, I pine away, woe is me! the treacherous have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously.	23
ASV	Isaiah	24	17	Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	24	18	And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.	23
ASV	Isaiah	24	19	The earth is utterly broken, the earth is rent asunder, the earth is shaken violently.	23
ASV	Isaiah	24	20	The earth shall stagger like a drunken man, and shall sway to and fro like a hammock; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it, and it shall fall, and not rise again.	23
ASV	Isaiah	24	21	And it shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah will punish the host of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	24	22	And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison; and after many days shall they be visited.	23
ASV	Isaiah	24	23	Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for Jehovah of hosts will reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem; and before his elders shall be glory.	23
ASV	Isaiah	25	1	O Jehovah, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things, even counsels of old, in faithfulness and truth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	25	2	For thou hast made of a city a heap, of a fortified city a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.	23
ASV	Isaiah	25	3	Therefore shall a strong people glorify thee; a city of terrible nations shall fear thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	25	4	For thou hast been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.	23
ASV	Isaiah	25	5	As the heat in a dry place wilt thou bring down the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the terrible ones shall be brought low.	23
ASV	Isaiah	25	6	And in this mountain will Jehovah of hosts make unto all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.	23
ASV	Isaiah	25	7	And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering that covereth all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations.	23
ASV	Isaiah	25	8	He hath swallowed up death for ever; and the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the reproach of his people will he take away from off all the earth: for Jehovah hath spoken it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	25	9	And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is Jehovah; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.	23
ASV	Isaiah	25	10	For in this mountain will the hand of Jehovah rest; and Moab shall be trodden down in his place, even as straw is trodden down in the water of the dung-hill.	23
ASV	Isaiah	25	11	And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst thereof, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim; but Jehovah will lay low his pride together with the craft of his hands.	23
ASV	Isaiah	25	12	And the high fortress of thy walls hath he brought down, laid low, and brought to the ground, even to the dust.	23
ASV	Isaiah	26	1	In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah: we have a strong city; salvation will he appoint for walls and bulwarks.	23
ASV	Isaiah	26	2	Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth faith may enter in.	23
ASV	Isaiah	26	3	Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee; because he trusteth in thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	26	4	Trust ye in Jehovah for ever; for in Jehovah, even Jehovah, is an everlasting rock.	23
ASV	Isaiah	26	5	For he hath brought down them that dwell on high, the lofty city: he layeth it low, he layeth it low even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust.	23
ASV	Isaiah	26	6	The foot shall tread it down; even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.	23
ASV	Isaiah	26	7	The way of the just is uprightness: thou that art upright dost direct the path of the just.	23
ASV	Isaiah	26	8	Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O Jehovah, have we waited for thee; to thy name, even to thy memorial name, is the desire of our soul.	23
ASV	Isaiah	26	9	With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee earnestly: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.	23
ASV	Isaiah	26	10	Let favor be showed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness will he deal wrongfully, and will not behold the majesty of Jehovah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	26	11	Jehovah, thy hand is lifted up, yet they see not: but they shall see thy zeal for the people, and be put to shame; yea, fire shall devour thine adversaries.	23
ASV	Isaiah	26	12	Jehovah, thou wilt ordain peace for us; for thou hast also wrought all our works for us.	23
ASV	Isaiah	26	13	O Jehovah our God, other lords besides thee have had dominion over us; but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.	23
ASV	Isaiah	26	14	They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all remembrance of them to perish.	23
ASV	Isaiah	26	15	Thou hast increased the nation, O Jehovah, thou hast increased the nation; thou art glorified; thou hast enlarged all the borders of the land.	23
ASV	Isaiah	26	16	Jehovah, in trouble have they visited thee; they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	26	17	Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain and crieth out in her pangs; so we have been before thee, O Jehovah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	26	18	We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.	23
ASV	Isaiah	26	19	Thy dead shall live; my dead bodies shall arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust; for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast forth the dead.	23
ASV	Isaiah	26	20	Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.	23
ASV	Isaiah	26	21	For, behold, Jehovah cometh forth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.	23
ASV	Isaiah	27	1	In that day Jehovah with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan the swift serpent, and leviathan the crooked serpent; and he will slay the monster that is in the sea.	23
ASV	Isaiah	27	2	In that day: A vineyard of wine, sing ye unto it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	27	3	I Jehovah am its keeper; I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.	23
ASV	Isaiah	27	4	Wrath is not in me: would that the briers and thorns were against me in battle! I would march upon them, I would burn them together.	23
ASV	Isaiah	27	5	Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; yea, let him make peace with me.	23
ASV	Isaiah	27	6	In days to come shall Jacob take root; Israel shall blossom and bud; and they shall fill the face of the world with fruit.	23
ASV	Isaiah	27	7	Hath he smitten them as he smote those that smote them? or are they slain according to the slaughter of them that were slain by them?	23
ASV	Isaiah	27	8	In measure, when thou sendest them away, thou dost content with them; he hath removed them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind.	23
ASV	Isaiah	27	9	Therefore by this shall the iniquity of Jacob be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: that he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, so that the Asherim and the sun-images shall rise no more.	23
ASV	Isaiah	27	10	For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness: there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof.	23
ASV	Isaiah	27	11	When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off; the women shall come, and set them on fire; for it is a people of no understanding: therefore he that made them will not have compassion upon them, and he that formed them will show them no f	23
ASV	Isaiah	27	12	And it shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah will beat off his fruit from the flood of the River unto the brook of Egypt; and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel.	23
ASV	Isaiah	27	13	And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great trumpet shall be blown; and they shall come that were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and they that were outcasts in the land of Egypt; and they shall worship Jehovah in the holy mountain at Jeru	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	1	Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley of them that are overcome with wine!	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	2	Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one; as a tempest of hail, a destroying storm, as a tempest of mighty waters overflowing, will he cast down to the earth with the hand.	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	3	The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trodden under foot:	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	4	and the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be as the first-ripe fig before the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	5	In that day will Jehovah of hosts become a crown of glory, and a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people;	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	6	and a spirit of justice to him that sitteth in judgment, and strength to them that turn back the battle at the gate.	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	7	And even these reel with wine, and stagger with strong drink; the priest and the prophet reel with strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they stagger with strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	8	For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean.	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	9	Whom will he teach knowledge? and whom will he make to understand the message? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts?	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	10	For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little.	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	11	Nay, but by men of strange lips and with another tongue will he speak to this people;	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	12	to whom he said, This is the rest, give ye rest to him that is weary; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	13	Therefore shall the word of Jehovah be unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little; that they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	14	Wherefore hear the word of Jehovah, ye scoffers, that rule this people that is in Jerusalem:	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	15	Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with Sheol are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	16	therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner -stone of sure foundation: he that believeth shall not be in haste.	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	17	And I will make justice the line, and righteousness the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place.	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	18	And your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	19	As often as it passeth though, it shall take you; for morning by morning shall it pass through, by day and by night: and it shall be nought but terror to understand the message.	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	20	For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it; and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	21	For Jehovah will rise up as in mount Perazim, he will be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may do his work, his strange work, and bring to pass his act, his strange act.	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	22	Now therefore be ye not scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong; for a decree of destruction have I heard from the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, upon the whole earth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	23	Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	24	Doth he that ploweth to sow plow continually? doth he continually open and harrow his ground?	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	25	When he hath levelled the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and put in the wheat in rows, and the barley in the appointed place, and the spelt in the border thereof?	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	26	For his God doth instruct him aright, and doth teach him.	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	27	For the fitches are not threshed with a sharp threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	28	Bread grain is ground; for he will not be always threshing it: and though the wheel of his cart and his horses scatter it, he doth not grind it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	28	29	This also cometh forth from Jehovah of hosts, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	1	Ho Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped! add ye year to year; let the feasts come round:	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	2	then will I distress Ariel, and there shall be mourning and lamentation; and she shall be unto me as Ariel.	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	3	And I will encamp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with posted troops, and I will raise siege works against thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	4	And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust; and thy voice shall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	5	But the multitude of thy foes shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones as chaff that passeth away: yea, it shall be in an instant suddenly.	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	6	She shall be visited of Jehovah of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	7	And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her stronghold, and that distress her, shall be as a dream, a vision of the night.	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	8	And it shall be as when a hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the m	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	9	Tarry ye and wonder; take your pleasure and be blind: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	10	For Jehovah hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes, the prophets; and your heads, the seers, hath he covered.	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	11	And all vision is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I cannot, for it is sealed:	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	12	and the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I am not learned.	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	13	And the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw nigh unto me, and with their mouth and with their lips to honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment of men which hath been taught them;	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	14	therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	15	Woe unto them that hide deep their counsel from Jehovah, and whose works are in the dark, and that say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	16	Ye turn things upside down! Shall the potter be esteemed as clay; that the thing made should say of him that made it, He made me not; or the thing formed say of him that formed it, He hath no understanding?	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	17	Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	18	And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	19	The meek also shall increase their joy in Jehovah, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	20	For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scoffer ceaseth, and all they that watch for iniquity are cut off;	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	21	that make a man an offender in his cause, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just with a thing of nought.	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	22	Therefore thus saith Jehovah, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	23	But when he seeth his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name; yea, they shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall stand in awe of the God of Israel.	23
ASV	Isaiah	29	24	They also that err in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmur shall receive instruction.	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	1	Woe to the rebellious children, saith Jehovah, that take counsel, but not of me; and that make a league, but not of my Spirit, that they may add sin to sin,	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	2	that set out to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt!	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	3	Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	4	For their princes are at Zoan, and their ambassadors are come to Hanes.	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	5	They shall all be ashamed because of a people that cannot profit them, that are not a help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	6	The burden of the beasts of the South. Through the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the humps of	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	7	For Egypt helpeth in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I called her Rahab that sitteth still.	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	8	Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever.	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	9	For it is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of Jehovah;	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	10	that say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits,	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	11	get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	12	Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rely thereon;	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	13	therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly in an instant.	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	14	And he shall break it as a potters vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing; so that there shall not be found among the pieces thereof a sherd wherewith to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern.	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	15	For thus said the Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength. And ye would not:	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	16	but ye said, No, for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	17	One thousand shall flee at the threat of one; at the threat of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on a hill.	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	18	And therefore will Jehovah wait, that he may be gracious unto you; and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for Jehovah is a God of justice; blessed are all they that wait for him.	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	19	For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem; thou shalt weep no more; he will surely be gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear, he will answer thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	20	And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be hidden anymore, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers;	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	21	and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it; when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	22	And ye shall defile the overlaying of thy graven images of silver, and the plating of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as an unclean thing; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	23	And he will give the rain for thy seed, wherewith thou shalt sow the ground; and bread of the increase of the ground, and it shall be fat and plenteous. In that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures;	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	24	the oxen likewise and the young asses that till the ground shall eat savory provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork.	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	25	And there shall be upon every lofty mountain, and upon every high hill, brooks and streams of waters, in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	26	Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that Jehovah bindeth up the hurt of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	27	Behold, the name of Jehovah cometh from far, burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue is as a devouring fire;	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	28	and his breath is as an overflowing stream, that reacheth even unto the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction: and a bridle that causeth to err shall be in the jaws of the peoples.	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	29	Ye shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come unto the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel.	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	30	And Jehovah will cause his glorious voice to be heard, and will show the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast, and tempest, and hailstones.	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	31	For through the voice of Jehovah shall the Assyrian be dismayed; with his rod will he smite him.	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	32	And every stroke of the appointed staff, which Jehovah shall lay upon him, shall be with the sound of tabrets and harps; and in battles with the brandishing of his arm will he fight with them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	30	33	For a Topheth is prepared of old; yea, for the king it is made ready; he hath made it deep and large; the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of Jehovah, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	31	1	Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, and rely on horses, and trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are very strong, but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek Jehovah!	23
ASV	Isaiah	31	2	Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evil-doers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.	23
ASV	Isaiah	31	3	Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit: and when Jehovah shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall stumble, and he that is helped shall fall, and they all shall be consumed together.	23
ASV	Isaiah	31	4	For thus saith Jehovah unto me, As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey, if a multitude of shepherds be called forth against him, will not be dismayed at their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so will Jehovah of hosts come dow	23
ASV	Isaiah	31	5	As birds hovering, so will Jehovah of hosts protect Jerusalem; he will protect and deliver it, he will pass over and preserve it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	31	6	Turn ye unto him from whom ye have deeply revolted, O children of Israel.	23
ASV	Isaiah	31	7	For in that day they shall cast away every man his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a sin.	23
ASV	Isaiah	31	8	And the Assyrian shall fall by the sword, not of man; and the sword, not of men, shall devour him; and he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall become subject to taskwork.	23
ASV	Isaiah	31	9	And his rock shall pass away by reason of terror, and his princes shall be dismayed at the ensign, saith Jehovah, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.	23
ASV	Isaiah	32	1	Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in justice.	23
ASV	Isaiah	32	2	And a man shall be as a hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest, as streams of water in a dry place, as the shade of a great rock in a weary land.	23
ASV	Isaiah	32	3	And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.	23
ASV	Isaiah	32	4	And the heart of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.	23
ASV	Isaiah	32	5	The fool shall be no more called noble, nor the churl said to be bountiful.	23
ASV	Isaiah	32	6	For the fool will speak folly, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise profaneness, and to utter error against Jehovah, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and to cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.	23
ASV	Isaiah	32	7	And the instruments of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the meek with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right.	23
ASV	Isaiah	32	8	But the noble deviseth noble things; and in noble things shall he continue.	23
ASV	Isaiah	32	9	Rise up, ye women that are at ease, and hear my voice; ye careless daughters, give ear unto my speech.	23
ASV	Isaiah	32	10	For days beyond a year shall ye be troubled, ye careless women; for the vintage shall fail, the ingathering shall not come.	23
ASV	Isaiah	32	11	Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones; strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon your loins.	23
ASV	Isaiah	32	12	They shall smite upon the breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.	23
ASV	Isaiah	32	13	Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city.	23
ASV	Isaiah	32	14	For the palace shall be forsaken; the populous city shall be deserted; the hill and the watch-tower shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;	23
ASV	Isaiah	32	15	until the Spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be esteemed as a forest.	23
ASV	Isaiah	32	16	Then justice shall dwell in the wilderness; and righteousness shall abide in the fruitful field.	23
ASV	Isaiah	32	17	And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness, quietness and confidence for ever.	23
ASV	Isaiah	32	18	And my people shall abide in a peaceable habitation, and in safe dwellings, and in quiet resting-places.	23
ASV	Isaiah	32	19	But it shall hail in the downfall of the forest; and the city shall be utterly laid low.	23
ASV	Isaiah	32	20	Blessed are yet that sow beside all waters, that send forth the feet of the ox and the ass.	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	1	Woe to thee that destroyest, and thou wast not destroyed; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! When thou hast ceased to destroy, thou shalt be destroyed; and when thou hast made an end of dealing treacherously, they shall	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	2	O Jehovah, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou our arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	3	At the noise of the tumult the peoples are fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations are scattered.	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	4	And your spoil shall be gathered as the caterpillar gathereth: as locusts leap shall men leap upon it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	5	Jehovah is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with justice and righteousness.	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	6	And there shall be stability in thy times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge: the fear of Jehovah is thy treasure.	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	7	Behold, their valiant ones cry without; the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	8	The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: the enemy hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth not man.	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	9	The land mourneth and languisheth; Lebanon is confounded and withereth away; Sharon is like a desert; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their leaves.	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	10	Now will I arise, saith Jehovah; now will I lift up myself; now will I be exalted.	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	11	Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath is a fire that shall devour you.	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	12	And the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime, as thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire.	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	13	Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might.	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	14	The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling hath seized the godless ones: Who among us can dwell with the devouring fire? who among us can dwell with everlasting burnings?	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	15	He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from taking a bribe, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil:	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	16	He shall dwell on high; his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks; his bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	17	Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold a land that reacheth afar.	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	18	Thy heart shall muse on the terror: Where is he that counted, where is he that weighed the tribute? where is he that counted the towers?	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	19	Thou shalt not see the fierce people, a people of a deep speech that thou canst not comprehend, of a strange tongue that thou canst not understand.	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	20	Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tent that shall not be removed, the stakes whereof shall never be plucked up, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	21	But there Jehovah will be with us in majesty, a place of broad rivers and streams, wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	22	For Jehovah is our judge, Jehovah is our lawgiver, Jehovah is our king; he will save us.	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	23	Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not strengthen the foot of their mast, they could not spread the sail: then was the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame took the prey.	23
ASV	Isaiah	33	24	And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.	23
ASV	Isaiah	34	1	Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye peoples: let the earth hear, and the fulness thereof; the world, and all things that come forth from it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	34	2	For Jehovah hath indignation against all the nations, and wrath against all their host: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.	23
ASV	Isaiah	34	3	Their slain also shall be cast out, and the stench of their dead bodies shall come up; and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.	23
ASV	Isaiah	34	4	And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll; and all their host shall fade away, as the leaf fadeth from off the vine, and as a fading leaf from the fig-tree.	23
ASV	Isaiah	34	5	For my sword hath drunk its fill in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.	23
ASV	Isaiah	34	6	The sword of Jehovah is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for Jehovah hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.	23
ASV	Isaiah	34	7	And the wild-oxen shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls: and their land shall be drunken with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.	23
ASV	Isaiah	34	8	For Jehovah hath a day of vengeance, a year of recompense for the cause of Zion.	23
ASV	Isaiah	34	9	And the streams of Edom shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.	23
ASV	Isaiah	34	10	It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever; from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.	23
ASV	Isaiah	34	11	But the pelican and the porcupine shall possess it; and the owl and the raven shall dwell therein: and he will stretch over it the line of confusion, and the plummet of emptiness.	23
ASV	Isaiah	34	12	They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none shall be there; and all its princes shall be nothing.	23
ASV	Isaiah	34	13	And thorns shall come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles in the fortresses thereof; and it shall be a habitation of jackals, a court for ostriches.	23
ASV	Isaiah	34	14	And the wild beasts of the desert shall meet with the wolves, and the wild goat shall cry to his fellow; yea, the night-monster shall settle there, and shall find her a place of rest.	23
ASV	Isaiah	34	15	There shall the dart-snake make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shade; yea, there shall the kites be gathered, every one with her mate.	23
ASV	Isaiah	34	16	Seek ye out of the book of Jehovah, and read: no one of these shall be missing, none shall want her mate; for my mouth, it hath commanded, and his Spirit, it hath gathered them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	34	17	And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever; from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.	23
ASV	Isaiah	35	1	The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.	23
ASV	Isaiah	35	2	It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing; the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon: they shall see the glory of Jehovah, the excellency of our God.	23
ASV	Isaiah	35	3	Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.	23
ASV	Isaiah	35	4	Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, with the recompense of God; he will come and save you.	23
ASV	Isaiah	35	5	Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.	23
ASV	Isaiah	35	6	Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.	23
ASV	Isaiah	35	7	And the glowing sand shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water: in the habitation of jackals, where they lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.	23
ASV	Isaiah	35	8	And a highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but is shall be for the redeemed: the wayfaring men, yea fools, shall not err therein.	23
ASV	Isaiah	35	9	No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast go up thereon; they shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there:	23
ASV	Isaiah	35	10	and the ransomed of Jehovah shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.	23
ASV	Isaiah	36	1	Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	36	2	And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fullers field.	23
ASV	Isaiah	36	3	Then came forth unto him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder.	23
ASV	Isaiah	36	4	And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?	23
ASV	Isaiah	36	5	I say, thy counsel and strength for the war are but vain words: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled against me?	23
ASV	Isaiah	36	6	Behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him.	23
ASV	Isaiah	36	7	But if thou say unto me, We trust in Jehovah our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?	23
ASV	Isaiah	36	8	Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	36	9	How then canst thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my masters servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?	23
ASV	Isaiah	36	10	And am I now come up without Jehovah against this land to destroy it? Jehovah said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	36	11	Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.	23
ASV	Isaiah	36	12	But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?	23
ASV	Isaiah	36	13	Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.	23
ASV	Isaiah	36	14	Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you:	23
ASV	Isaiah	36	15	neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us; this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.	23
ASV	Isaiah	36	16	Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;	23
ASV	Isaiah	36	17	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.	23
ASV	Isaiah	36	18	Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?	23
ASV	Isaiah	36	19	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?	23
ASV	Isaiah	36	20	Who are they among all the gods of these countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?	23
ASV	Isaiah	36	21	But they held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the kings commandment was, saying, Answer him not.	23
ASV	Isaiah	36	22	Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	1	And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	2	And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	3	And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	4	It may be Jehovah thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Jehovah thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	5	So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	6	And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith Jehovah, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	7	Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear tidings, and shall return unto his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	8	So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	9	And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come out to fight against thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	10	Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	11	Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	12	Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar?	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	13	Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	14	And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	15	And Hezekiah prayed unto Jehovah, saying,	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	16	O Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, that sittest above the cherubim, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	17	Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to defy the living God.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	18	Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries, and their land,	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	19	and have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of mens hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	20	Now therefore, O Jehovah our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art Jehovah, even thou only.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	21	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	22	this is the word which Jehovah hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	23	Whom hast thou defied and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	24	By thy servants hast thou defied the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir-trees thereof; and	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	25	I have digged and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	26	Hast thou not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that it should be thine to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	27	Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as a field of grain before it is grown up.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	28	But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	29	Because of thy raging against me, and because thine arrogancy is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	30	And this shall be the sign unto thee: ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	31	And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	32	For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	33	Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	34	By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith Jehovah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	35	For I will defend this city to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant Davids sake.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	36	And the angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	37	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.	23
ASV	Isaiah	37	38	And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.	23
ASV	Isaiah	38	1	In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.	23
ASV	Isaiah	38	2	Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto Jehovah,	23
ASV	Isaiah	38	3	and said, Remember now, O Jehovah, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.	23
ASV	Isaiah	38	4	Then came the word of Jehovah to Isaiah, saying,	23
ASV	Isaiah	38	5	Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.	23
ASV	Isaiah	38	6	And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city.	23
ASV	Isaiah	38	7	And this shall be the sign unto thee from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do this thing that he hath spoken:	23
ASV	Isaiah	38	8	behold, I will cause the shadow on the steps, which is gone down on the dial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps. So the sun returned ten steps on the dial whereon it was gone down.	23
ASV	Isaiah	38	9	The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness.	23
ASV	Isaiah	38	10	I said, In the noontide of my days I shall go into the gates of Sheol: I am deprived of the residue of my years.	23
ASV	Isaiah	38	11	I said, I shall not see Jehovah, even Jehovah in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.	23
ASV	Isaiah	38	12	My dwelling is removed, and is carried away from me as a shepherds tent: I have rolled up, like a weaver, my life; he will cut me off from the loom: From day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.	23
ASV	Isaiah	38	13	I quieted myself until morning; as a lion, so he breaketh all my bones: From day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.	23
ASV	Isaiah	38	14	Like a swallow or a crane, so did I chatter; I did moan as a dove; mine eyes fail with looking upward: O Lord, I am oppressed, be thou my surety.	23
ASV	Isaiah	38	15	What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.	23
ASV	Isaiah	38	16	O Lord, by these things men live; And wholly therein is the life of my spirit: Wherefore recover thou me, and make me to live.	23
ASV	Isaiah	38	17	Behold, it was for my peace that I had great bitterness: But thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption; For thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.	23
ASV	Isaiah	38	18	For Sheol cannot praise thee, death cannot celebrate thee: They that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	38	19	The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: The father to the children shall make known thy truth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	38	20	Jehovah is ready to save me: Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments All the days of our life in the house of Jehovah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	38	21	Now Isaiah had said, Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the boil, and he shall recover.	23
ASV	Isaiah	38	22	Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of Jehovah?	23
ASV	Isaiah	39	1	At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.	23
ASV	Isaiah	39	2	And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor i	23
ASV	Isaiah	39	3	Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from Babylon.	23
ASV	Isaiah	39	4	Then said he, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	39	5	Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah of hosts:	23
ASV	Isaiah	39	6	Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith Jehovah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	39	7	And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.	23
ASV	Isaiah	39	8	Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of Jehovah which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	1	Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	2	Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem; and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she hath received of Jehovahs hand double for all her sins.	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	3	The voice of one that crieth, Prepare ye in the wilderness the way of Jehovah; make level in the desert a highway for our God.	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	4	Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the uneven shall be made level, and the rough places a plain:	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	5	and the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	6	The voice of one saying, Cry. And one said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field.	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	7	The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, because the breath of Jehovah bloweth upon it; surely the people is grass.	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	8	The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our God shall stand forever.	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	9	O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion, get thee up on a high mountain; O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold, your God!	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	10	Behold, the Lord Jehovah will come as a mighty one, and his arm will rule for him: Behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	11	He will feed his flock like a shepherd, he will gather the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and will gently lead those that have their young.	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	12	Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	13	Who hath directed the Spirit of Jehovah, or being his counsellor hath taught him?	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	14	With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding?	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	15	Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are accounted as the small dust of the balance: Behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	16	And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt-offering.	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	17	All the nations are as nothing before him; they are accounted by him as less than nothing, and vanity.	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	18	To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	19	The image, a workman hath cast it, and the goldsmith overlayeth it with gold, and casteth for it silver chains.	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	20	He that is too impoverished for such an oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a skilful workman to set up a graven image, that shall not be moved.	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	21	Have ye not known? have yet not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	22	It is he that sitteth above the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in;	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	23	that bringeth princes to nothing; that maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	24	Yea, they have not been planted; yea, they have not been sown; yea, their stock hath not taken root in the earth: moreover he bloweth upon them, and they wither, and the whirlwind taketh them away as stubble.	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	25	To whom then will ye liken me, that I should be equal to him? saith the Holy One.	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	26	Lift up your eyes on high, and see who hath created these, that bringeth out their host by number; he calleth them all by name; by the greatness of his might, and for that he is strong in power, not one is lacking.	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	27	Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from Jehovah, and the justice due to me is passed away from my God?	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	28	Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard? The everlasting God, Jehovah, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary; there is no searching of his understanding.	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	29	He giveth power to the faint; and to him that hath no might he increaseth strength.	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	30	Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:	23
ASV	Isaiah	40	31	but they that wait for Jehovah shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not faint.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	1	Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the peoples renew their strength: let them come near; then let them speak; let us come near together to judgment.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	2	Who hath raised up one from the east, whom he calleth in righteousness to his foot? he giveth nations before him, and maketh him rule over kings; he giveth them as the dust to his sword, as the driven stubble to his bow.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	3	He pursueth them, and passeth on safely, even by a way that he had not gone with his feet.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	4	Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I, Jehovah, the first, and with the last, I am he.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	5	The isles have seen, and fear; the ends of the earth tremble; they draw near, and come.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	6	They help every one his neighbor; and every one saith to his brother, Be of good courage.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	7	So the carpenter encourageth the goldsmith, and he that smootheth with the hammer him that smiteth the anvil, saying of the soldering, It is good; and he fasteneth it with nails, that is should not be moved.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	8	But thou, Israel, my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend,	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	9	thou whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth, and called from the corners thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art my servant, I have chosen thee and not cast thee away;	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	10	Fear thou not, for I am with thee; be not dismayed, for I am thy God; I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	11	Behold, all they that are incensed against thee shall be put to shame and confounded: they that strive with thee shall be as nothing, and shall perish.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	12	Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that contend with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	13	For I, Jehovah thy God, will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	14	Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith Jehovah, and thy Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	15	Behold, I have made thee to be a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth; thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	16	Thou shalt winnow them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them; and thou shalt rejoice in Jehovah, thou shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	17	The poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst; I, Jehovah, will answer them, I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	18	I will open rivers on the bare heights, and fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	19	I will put in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia, and the myrtle, and the oil-tree; I will set in the desert the fir-tree, the pine, and the box-tree together:	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	20	that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of Jehovah hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	21	Produce your cause, saith Jehovah; bring forth your strong reasons, saith the King of Jacob.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	22	Let them bring forth, and declare unto us what shall happen: declare ye the former things, what they are, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or show us things to come.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	23	Declare the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	24	Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work is of nought; an abomination is he that chooseth you.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	25	I have raised up one from the north, and he is come; from the rising of the sun one that calleth upon my name: and he shall come upon rulers as upon mortar, and as the potter treadeth clay.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	26	Who hath declared it from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, He is right? yea, there is none that declareth, yea, there is none that showeth, yea, there is none that heareth your words.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	27	I am the first that saith unto Zion, Behold, behold them; and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	28	And when I look, there is no man: even among them there is no counsellor, that, when I ask of them, can answer a word.	23
ASV	Isaiah	41	29	Behold, all of them, their works are vanity and nought; their molten images are wind and confusion.	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	1	Behold, my servant, whom I uphold; my chosen, in whom my soul delighteth: I have put my Spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the Gentiles.	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	2	He will not cry, nor lift up his voice, nor cause it to be heard in the street.	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	3	A bruised reed will he not break, and a dimly burning wick will he not quench: he will bring forth justice in truth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	4	He will not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set justice in the earth; and the isles shall wait for his law.	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	5	Thus saith God Jehovah, he that created the heavens, and stretched them forth; he that spread abroad the earth and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	6	I, Jehovah, have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thy hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	7	to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house.	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	8	I am Jehovah, that is my name; and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise unto graven images.	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	9	Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare; before they spring forth I tell you of them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	10	Sing unto Jehovah a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth; ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein, the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	11	Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit; let the inhabitants of Sela sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	12	Let them give glory unto Jehovah, and declare his praise in the islands.	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	13	Jehovah will go forth as a mighty man; he will stir up his zeal like a man of war: he will cry, yea, he will shout aloud; he will do mightily against his enemies.	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	14	I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: now will I cry out like a travailing woman; I will gasp and pant together.	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	15	I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and will dry up the pools.	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	16	And I will bring the blind by a way that they know not; in paths that they know not will I lead them; I will make darkness light before them, and crooked places straight. These things will I do, and I will not forsake them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	17	They shall be turned back, they shall be utterly put to shame, that trust in graven images, that say unto molten images, Ye are our gods.	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	18	Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	19	Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I send? who is blind as he that is at peace with me, and blind as Jehovahs servant?	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	20	Thou seest many things, but thou observest not; his ears are open, but he heareth not.	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	21	It pleased Jehovah, for his righteousness sake, to magnify the law, and make it honorable.	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	22	But this is a people robbed and plundered; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison-houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	23	Who is there among you that will give ear to this? that will hearken and hear for the time to come?	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	24	Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not Jehovah? he against whom we have sinned, and in whose ways they would not walk, neither were they obedient unto his law.	23
ASV	Isaiah	42	25	Therefore he poured upon him the fierceness of his anger, and the strength of battle; and it set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	1	But now thus saith Jehovah that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel: Fear not, for I have redeemed thee; I have called thee by thy name, thou art mine.	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	2	When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	3	For I am Jehovah thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour; I have given Egypt as thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in thy stead.	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	4	Since thou hast been precious in my sight, and honorable, and I have loved thee; therefore will I give men in thy stead, and peoples instead of thy life.	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	5	Fear not; for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	6	I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back; bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the end of the earth;	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	7	every one that is called by my name, and whom I have created for my glory, whom I have formed, yea, whom I have made.	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	8	Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	9	Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the peoples be assembled: who among them can declare this, and show us former things? let them bring their witnesses, that they may be justified; or let them hear, and say, It is truth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	10	Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	11	I, even I, am Jehovah; and besides me there is no saviour.	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	12	I have declared, and I have saved, and I have showed; and there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and I am God.	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	13	Yea, since the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who can hinder it?	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	14	Thus saith Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and I will bring down all of them as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, in the ships of their rejoicing.	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	15	I am Jehovah, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	16	Thus saith Jehovah, who maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	17	who bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the mighty man (they lie down together, they shall not rise; they are extinct, they are quenched as a wick):	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	18	Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	19	Behold, I will do a new thing; now shall it spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	20	The beasts of the field shall honor me, the jackals and the ostriches; because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen,	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	21	the people which I formed for myself, that they might set forth my praise.	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	22	Yet thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	23	Thou hast not brought me of thy sheep for burnt-offerings; neither hast thou honored me with thy sacrifices. I have not burdened thee with offerings, nor wearied thee with frankincense.	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	24	Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices; but thou hast burdened me with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	25	I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake; and I will not remember thy sins.	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	26	Put me in remembrance; let us plead together: set thou forth thy cause, that thou mayest be justified.	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	27	Thy first father sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.	23
ASV	Isaiah	43	28	Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary; and I will make Jacob a curse, and Israel a reviling.	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	1	Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant, and Israel, who I have chosen:	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	2	Thus saith Jehovah that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, who will help thee: Fear not, O Jacob my servant; and thou, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	3	For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and streams upon the dry ground; I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	4	and they shall spring up among the grass, as willows by the watercourses.	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	5	One shall say, I am Jehovahs; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto Jehovah, and surname himself by the name of Israel.	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	6	Thus saith Jehovah, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts: I am the first, and I am the last; and besides me there is no God.	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	7	And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I established the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and that shall come to pass, let them declare.	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	8	Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have I not declared unto thee of old, and showed it? and ye are my witnesses. Is there a God besides me? yea, there is no Rock; I know not any.	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	9	They that fashion a graven image are all of them vanity; and the things that they delight in shall not profit; and their own witnesses see not, nor know: that they may be put to shame.	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	10	Who hath fashioned a god, or molten an image that is profitable for nothing?	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	11	Behold, all his fellows shall be put to shame; and the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; they shall fear, they shall be put to shame together.	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	12	The smith maketh an axe, and worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with his strong arm: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth; he drinketh no water, and is faint.	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	13	The carpenter stretcheth out a line; he marketh it out with a pencil; he shapeth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compasses, and shapeth it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man, to dwell in a house.	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	14	He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the holm-tree and the oak, and strengtheneth for himself one among the trees of the forest: he planteth a fir-tree, and the rain doth nourish it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	15	Then shall it be for a man to burn; and he taketh thereof, and warmeth himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread: yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	16	He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied; yea, he warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire.	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	17	And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image; he falleth down unto it and worshippeth, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	18	They know not, neither do they consider: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand.	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	19	And none calleth to mind, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abominatio	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	20	He feedeth on ashes; a deceived heart hath turned him aside; and he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	21	Remember these things, O Jacob, and Israel; for thou art my servant: I have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me.	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	22	I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	23	Sing, O ye heavens, for Jehovah hath done it; shout, ye lower parts of the earth; break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob, and will glorify himself in Israel.	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	24	Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb: I am Jehovah, that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth (who is with me?);	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	25	that frustrateth the signs of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	26	that confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith of Jerusalem, She shall be inhabited; and of the cities of Judah, They shall be built, and I will raise up the waste places thereof;	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	27	that saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers;	23
ASV	Isaiah	44	28	That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure, even saying of Jerusalem, She shall be built; and of the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	1	Thus saith Jehovah to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him, and I will loose the loins of kings; to open the doors before him, and the gates shall not be shut:	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	2	I will go before thee, and make the rough places smooth; I will break in pieces the doors of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron;	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	3	and I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that it is I, Jehovah, who call thee by thy name, even the God of Israel.	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	4	For Jacob my servants sake, and Israel my chosen, I have called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	5	I am Jehovah, and there is none else; besides me there is no God. I will gird thee, though thou hast not known me;	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	6	that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none besides me: I am Jehovah, and there is none else.	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	7	I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil. I am Jehovah, that doeth all these things.	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	8	Distil, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, that it may bring forth salvation, and let it cause righteousness to spring up together; I, Jehovah, have created it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	9	Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! a potsherd among the potsherds of the earth! Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	10	Woe unto him that saith unto a father, What begettest thou? or to a woman, With what travailest thou?	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	11	Thus saith Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: Ask me of the things that are to come; concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands, command ye me.	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	12	I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens; and all their host have I commanded.	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	13	I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will make straight all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let my exiles go free, not for price nor reward, saith Jehovah of hosts.	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	14	Thus saith Jehovah, The labor of Egypt, and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall go after thee, in chains they shall come over; and they shall fall down unto thee, the	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	15	Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	16	They shall be put to shame, yea, confounded, all of them; they shall go into confusion together that are makers of idols.	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	17	But Israel shall be saved by Jehovah with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be put to shame nor confounded world without end.	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	18	For thus saith Jehovah that created the heavens, the God that formed the earth and made it, that established it and created it not a waste, that formed it to be inhabited: I am Jehovah; and there is none else.	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	19	I have not spoken in secret, in a place of the land of darkness; I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I, Jehovah, speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	20	Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	21	Declare ye, and bring it forth; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath showed this from ancient time? who hath declared it of old? have not I, Jehovah? and there is no God else besides me, a just God and a Saviour; there is none besides me.	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	22	Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else.	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	23	By myself have I sworn, the word is gone forth from my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, that unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	24	Only in Jehovah, it is said of me, is righteousness and strength; even to him shall men come; and all they that were incensed against him shall be put to shame.	23
ASV	Isaiah	45	25	In Jehovah shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.	23
ASV	Isaiah	46	1	Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth; their idols are upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: the things that ye carried about are made a load, a burden to the weary beast.	23
ASV	Isaiah	46	2	They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.	23
ASV	Isaiah	46	3	Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, that have been borne by me from their birth, that have been carried from the womb;	23
ASV	Isaiah	46	4	and even to old age I am he, and even to hoar hairs will I carry you; I have made, and I will bear; yea, I will carry, and will deliver.	23
ASV	Isaiah	46	5	To whom will ye like me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?	23
ASV	Isaiah	46	6	Such as lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, they hire a goldsmith, and he maketh it a god; they fall down, yea, they worship.	23
ASV	Isaiah	46	7	They bear it upon the shoulder, they carry it, and set it in its place, and it standeth, from its place shall it not remove: yea, one may cry unto it, yet can it not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.	23
ASV	Isaiah	46	8	Remember this, and show yourselves men; bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors.	23
ASV	Isaiah	46	9	Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me;	23
ASV	Isaiah	46	10	declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not yet done; saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure;	23
ASV	Isaiah	46	11	calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country; yea, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed, I will also do it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	46	12	Hearken unto me, ye stout-hearted, that are far from righteousness:	23
ASV	Isaiah	46	13	I bring near my righteousness, it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry; and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.	23
ASV	Isaiah	47	1	Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.	23
ASV	Isaiah	47	2	Take the millstones, and grind meal; remove thy veil, strip off the train, uncover the leg, pass through the rivers.	23
ASV	Isaiah	47	3	Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and will spare no man.	23
ASV	Isaiah	47	4	Our Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel.	23
ASV	Isaiah	47	5	Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for thou shalt no more be called The mistress of kingdoms.	23
ASV	Isaiah	47	6	I was wroth with my people, I profaned mine inheritance, and gave them into thy hand: thou didst show them no mercy; upon the aged hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.	23
ASV	Isaiah	47	7	And thou saidst, I shall be mistress for ever; so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end thereof.	23
ASV	Isaiah	47	8	Now therefore hear this, thou that art given to pleasures, that sittest securely, that sayest in thy heart, I am, and there is none else besides me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:	23
ASV	Isaiah	47	9	but these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood; in their full measure shall they come upon thee, in the multitude of thy sorceries, and the great abundance of thine enchantments.	23
ASV	Isaiah	47	10	For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness; thou hast said, None seeth me; thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee, and thou hast said in thy heart, I am, and there is none else besides me.	23
ASV	Isaiah	47	11	Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know the dawning thereof: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it away: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou knowest not.	23
ASV	Isaiah	47	12	Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast labored from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.	23
ASV	Isaiah	47	13	Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels: let now the astrologers, the star-gazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from the things that shall come upon thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	47	14	Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: it shall not be a coal to warm at, nor a fire to sit before.	23
ASV	Isaiah	47	15	Thus shall the things be unto thee wherein thou hast labored: they that have trafficked with thee from thy youth shall wander every one to his quarter; there shall be none to save thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	48	1	Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah; who swear by the name of Jehovah, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness.	23
ASV	Isaiah	48	2	(for they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; Jehovah of hosts is his name):	23
ASV	Isaiah	48	3	I have declared the former things from of old; yea, they went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them: suddenly I did them, and they came to pass.	23
ASV	Isaiah	48	4	Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;	23
ASV	Isaiah	48	5	therefore I have declared it to thee from of old; before it came to pass I showed it thee; lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	48	6	Thou hast heard it; behold all this; and ye, will ye not declare it? I have showed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, which thou hast not known.	23
ASV	Isaiah	48	7	They are created now, and not from of old; and before this day thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	48	8	Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from of old thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou didst deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.	23
ASV	Isaiah	48	9	For my names sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.	23
ASV	Isaiah	48	10	Behold, I have refined thee, but not as silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.	23
ASV	Isaiah	48	11	For mine own sake, for mine own sake, will I do it; for how should my name be profaned? and my glory will I not give to another.	23
ASV	Isaiah	48	12	Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and Israel my called: I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.	23
ASV	Isaiah	48	13	Yea, my hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spread out the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together.	23
ASV	Isaiah	48	14	Assemble yourselves, all ye, and hear; who among them hath declared these things? He whom Jehovah loveth shall perform his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.	23
ASV	Isaiah	48	15	I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him; I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.	23
ASV	Isaiah	48	16	Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; from the beginning I have not spoken in secret; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord Jehovah hath sent me, and his Spirit.	23
ASV	Isaiah	48	17	Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am Jehovah thy God, who teacheth thee to profit, who leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.	23
ASV	Isaiah	48	18	Oh that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:	23
ASV	Isaiah	48	19	thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the grains thereof: his name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before me.	23
ASV	Isaiah	48	20	Go ye forth from Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans; with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth: say ye, Jehovah hath redeemed his servant Jacob.	23
ASV	Isaiah	48	21	And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.	23
ASV	Isaiah	48	22	There is no peace, saith Jehovah, to the wicked.	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	1	Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye peoples, from far: Jehovah hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name:	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	2	and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me: and he hath made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he kept me close:	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	3	and he said unto me, Thou art my servant; Israel, in whom I will be glorified.	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	4	But I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nought and vanity; yet surely the justice due to me is with Jehovah, and my recompense with my God.	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	5	And now saith Jehovah that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, and that Israel be gathered unto him (for I am honorable in the eyes of Jehovah, and my God is become my strength);	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	6	yea, he saith, It is too light a thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	7	Thus saith Jehovah, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers: Kings shall see and arise; princes, and they shall worship; because of Jehovah that is faithful, even the Ho	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	8	Thus saith Jehovah, In an acceptable time have I answered thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee; and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to raise up the land, to make them inherit the desolate heritages:	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	9	saying to them that are bound, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and on all bare heights shall be their pasture.	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	10	They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them will lead them, even by springs of water will he guide them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	11	And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	12	Lo, these shall come from far; and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	13	Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for Jehovah hath comforted his people, and will have compassion upon his afflicted.	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	14	But Zion said, Jehovah hath forsaken me, and the Lord hath forgotten me.	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	15	Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, these may forget, yet will not I forget thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	16	Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	17	Thy children make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth from thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	18	Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith Jehovah, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all as with an ornament, and gird thyself with them, like a bride.	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	19	For, as for thy waste and thy desolate places, and thy land that hath been destroyed, surely now shalt thou be too strait for the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	20	The children of thy bereavement shall yet say in thine ears, The place is too strait for me; give place to me that I may dwell.	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	21	Then shalt thou say in thy heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have been bereaved of my children, and am solitary, an exile, and wandering to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where were they?	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	22	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations, and set up my ensign to the peoples; and they shall bring thy sons in their bosom, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	23	And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their faces to the earth, and lick the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah; and they that wait for me shall not be put to sh	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	24	Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captives be delivered?	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	25	But thus saith Jehovah, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered; for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.	23
ASV	Isaiah	49	26	And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I, Jehovah, am thy Saviour, and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.	23
ASV	Isaiah	50	1	Thus saith Jehovah, Where is the bill of your mothers divorcement, wherewith I have put her away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities were ye sold, and for your transgressions was your mother put away.	23
ASV	Isaiah	50	2	Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stink,	23
ASV	Isaiah	50	3	I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.	23
ASV	Isaiah	50	4	The Lord Jehovah hath given me the tongue of them that are taught, that I may know how to sustain with words him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as they that are taught.	23
ASV	Isaiah	50	5	The Lord Jehovah hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away backward.	23
ASV	Isaiah	50	6	I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; I hid not my face from shame and spitting.	23
ASV	Isaiah	50	7	For the Lord Jehovah will help me; therefore have I not been confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame.	23
ASV	Isaiah	50	8	He is near that justifieth me; who will content with me? let us stand up together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to me.	23
ASV	Isaiah	50	9	Behold, the Lord Jehovah will help me; who is he that shall condemn me? behold, all they shall wax old as a garment, the moth shall eat them up.	23
ASV	Isaiah	50	10	Who is among you that feareth Jehovah, that obeyeth the voice of his servant? he that walketh in darkness, and hath no light, let him trust in the name of Jehovah, and rely upon his God.	23
ASV	Isaiah	50	11	Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that gird yourselves about with firebrands; walk ye in the flame of your fire, and among the brands that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of my hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.	23
ASV	Isaiah	51	1	Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek Jehovah: look unto the rock whence ye were hewn, and to the hold of the pit whence ye were digged.	23
ASV	Isaiah	51	2	Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you; for when he was but one I called him, and I blessed him, and made him many.	23
ASV	Isaiah	51	3	For Jehovah hath comforted Zion; he hath comforted all her waste places, and hath made her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of Jehovah; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.	23
ASV	Isaiah	51	4	Attend unto me, O my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall go forth from me, and I will establish my justice for a light of the peoples.	23
ASV	Isaiah	51	5	My righteousness is near, my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the peoples; the isles shall wait for me, and on mine arm shall they trust.	23
ASV	Isaiah	51	6	Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment; and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my r	23
ASV	Isaiah	51	7	Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye dismayed at their revilings.	23
ASV	Isaiah	51	8	For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool; but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation unto all generations.	23
ASV	Isaiah	51	9	Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of Jehovah; awake, as in the days of old, the generations of ancient times. Is it not thou that didst cut Rahab in pieces, that didst pierce the monster?	23
ASV	Isaiah	51	10	Is it not thou that driedst up the sea, the waters of the great deep; that madest the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?	23
ASV	Isaiah	51	11	And the ransomed of Jehovah shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.	23
ASV	Isaiah	51	12	I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou art afraid of man that shall die, and of the son of man that shall be made as grass;	23
ASV	Isaiah	51	13	and hast forgotten Jehovah thy Maker, that stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and fearest continually all the day because of the fury of the oppressor, when he maketh ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppresso	23
ASV	Isaiah	51	14	The captive exile shall speedily be loosed; and he shall not die and go down into the pit, neither shall his bread fail.	23
ASV	Isaiah	51	15	For I am Jehovah thy God, who stirreth up the sea, so that the waves thereof roar: Jehovah of hosts is his name.	23
ASV	Isaiah	51	16	And I have put my words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shadow of my hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.	23
ASV	Isaiah	51	17	Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, that hast drunk at the hand of Jehovah the cup of his wrath; thou hast drunken the bowl of the cup of staggering, and drained it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	51	18	There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand among all the sons that she hath brought up.	23
ASV	Isaiah	51	19	These two things are befallen thee, who shall bemoan thee? desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword; how shall I comfort thee?	23
ASV	Isaiah	51	20	Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as an antelope in a net; they are full of the wrath of Jehovah, the rebuke of thy God.	23
ASV	Isaiah	51	21	Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but now with wine:	23
ASV	Isaiah	51	22	Thus saith thy Lord Jehovah, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thy hand the cup of staggering, even the bowl of the cup of my wrath; thou shalt no more drink it again:	23
ASV	Isaiah	51	23	and I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee, that have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over; and thou hast laid thy back as the ground, and as the street, to them that go over.	23
ASV	Isaiah	52	1	Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.	23
ASV	Isaiah	52	2	Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit on thy throne, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bonds of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.	23
ASV	Isaiah	52	3	For thus saith Jehovah, Ye were sold for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money.	23
ASV	Isaiah	52	4	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah, My people went down at the first into Egypt to sojourn there: and the Assyrian hath oppressed them without cause.	23
ASV	Isaiah	52	5	Now therefore, what do I here, saith Jehovah, seeing that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them do howl, saith Jehovah, and my name continually all the day is blasphemed.	23
ASV	Isaiah	52	6	Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak; behold, it is I.	23
ASV	Isaiah	52	7	How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace, that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation, that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!	23
ASV	Isaiah	52	8	The voice of thy watchmen! they lift up the voice, together do they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when Jehovah returneth to Zion.	23
ASV	Isaiah	52	9	Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem; for Jehovah hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.	23
ASV	Isaiah	52	10	Jehovah hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.	23
ASV	Isaiah	52	11	Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; cleanse yourselves, ye that bear the vessels of Jehovah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	52	12	For ye shall not go out in haste, neither shall ye go by flight: for Jehovah will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rearward.	23
ASV	Isaiah	52	13	Behold, my servant shall deal wisely, he shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high.	23
ASV	Isaiah	52	14	Like as many were astonished at thee (his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men),	23
ASV	Isaiah	52	15	so shall he sprinkle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they understand.	23
ASV	Isaiah	53	1	Who hath believed our message? and to whom hath the arm of Jehovah been revealed?	23
ASV	Isaiah	53	2	For he grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.	23
ASV	Isaiah	53	3	He was despised, and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and as one from whom men hide their face he was despised; and we esteemed him not.	23
ASV	Isaiah	53	4	Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.	23
ASV	Isaiah	53	5	But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.	23
ASV	Isaiah	53	6	All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and Jehovah hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.	23
ASV	Isaiah	53	7	He was oppressed, yet when he was afflicted he opened not his mouth; as a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that before its shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	53	8	By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who among them considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people to whom the stroke was due?	23
ASV	Isaiah	53	9	And they made his grave with the wicked, and with a rich man in his death; although he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	53	10	Yet it pleased Jehovah to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand.	23
ASV	Isaiah	53	11	He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by the knowledge of himself shall my righteous servant justify many; and he shall bear their iniquities.	23
ASV	Isaiah	53	12	Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured out his soul unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors: yet he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgresso	23
ASV	Isaiah	54	1	Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith Jehovah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	54	2	Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations; spare not: lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes.	23
ASV	Isaiah	54	3	For thou shalt spread aboard on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall possess the nations, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.	23
ASV	Isaiah	54	4	Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth; and the reproach of thy widowhood shalt thou remember no more.	23
ASV	Isaiah	54	5	For thy Maker is thy husband; Jehovah of hosts is his name: and the Holy One of Israel is thy Redeemer; the God of the whole earth shall he be called.	23
ASV	Isaiah	54	6	For Jehovah hath called thee as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, even a wife of youth, when she is cast off, saith thy God.	23
ASV	Isaiah	54	7	For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	54	8	In overflowing wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting lovingkindness will I have mercy on thee, saith Jehovah thy Redeemer.	23
ASV	Isaiah	54	9	For this is as the waters of Noah unto me; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I will not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	54	10	For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed; but my lovingkindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall my covenant of peace be removed, saith Jehovah that hath mercy on thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	54	11	O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will set thy stones in fair colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.	23
ASV	Isaiah	54	12	And I will make thy pinnacles of rubies, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy border of precious stones.	23
ASV	Isaiah	54	13	And all thy children shall be taught of Jehovah; and great shall be the peace of thy children.	23
ASV	Isaiah	54	14	In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression, for thou shalt not fear; and from terror, for it shall not come near thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	54	15	Behold, they may gather together, but not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall because of thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	54	16	Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the fire of coals, and bringeth forth a weapon for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.	23
ASV	Isaiah	54	17	No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of Jehovah, and their righteousness which is of me, saith Jehovah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	55	1	Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.	23
ASV	Isaiah	55	2	Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labor for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.	23
ASV	Isaiah	55	3	Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear, and your soul shall live: and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.	23
ASV	Isaiah	55	4	Behold, I have given him for a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander to the peoples.	23
ASV	Isaiah	55	5	Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not; and a nation that knew not thee shall run unto thee, because of Jehovah thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	55	6	Seek ye Jehovah while he may be found; call ye upon him while he is near:	23
ASV	Isaiah	55	7	let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto Jehovah, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.	23
ASV	Isaiah	55	8	For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith Jehovah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	55	9	For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.	23
ASV	Isaiah	55	10	For as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, and giveth seed to the sower and bread to the eater;	23
ASV	Isaiah	55	11	so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	55	12	For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing; and all the trees of the fields shall clap their hands.	23
ASV	Isaiah	55	13	Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir-tree; and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle-tree: and it shall be to Jehovah for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.	23
ASV	Isaiah	56	1	Thus saith Jehovah, Keep ye justice, and do righteousness; for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.	23
ASV	Isaiah	56	2	Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that holdeth it fast; that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.	23
ASV	Isaiah	56	3	Neither let the foreigner, that hath joined himself to Jehovah, speak, saying, Jehovah will surely separate me from his people; neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.	23
ASV	Isaiah	56	4	For thus saith Jehovah of the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and hold fast my covenant:	23
ASV	Isaiah	56	5	Unto them will I give in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters; I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.	23
ASV	Isaiah	56	6	Also the foreigners that join themselves to Jehovah, to minister unto him, and to love the name of Jehovah, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it, and holdeth fast my covenant;	23
ASV	Isaiah	56	7	even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.	23
ASV	Isaiah	56	8	The Lord Jehovah, who gathereth the outcasts of Israel, saith, Yet will I gather others to him, besides his own that are gathered.	23
ASV	Isaiah	56	9	All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all ye beasts in the forest.	23
ASV	Isaiah	56	10	His watchmen are blind, they are all without knowledge; they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.	23
ASV	Isaiah	56	11	Yea, the dogs are greedy, they can never have enough; and these are shepherds that cannot understand: they have all turned to their own way, each one to his gain, from every quarter.	23
ASV	Isaiah	56	12	Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to-morrow shall be as this day, a day great beyond measure.	23
ASV	Isaiah	57	1	The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.	23
ASV	Isaiah	57	2	He entereth into peace; they rest in their beds, each one that walketh in his uprightness.	23
ASV	Isaiah	57	3	But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the harlot.	23
ASV	Isaiah	57	4	Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, and put out the tongue? are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,	23
ASV	Isaiah	57	5	ye that inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree; that slay the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?	23
ASV	Isaiah	57	6	Among the smooth stones of the valley is thy portion; they, they are thy lot; even to them hast thou poured a drink-offering, thou hast offered an oblation. Shall I be appeased for these things?	23
ASV	Isaiah	57	7	Upon a high and lofty mountain hast thou set thy bed; thither also wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.	23
ASV	Isaiah	57	8	And behind the doors and the posts hast thou set up thy memorial: for thou hast uncovered thyself to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them: thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	57	9	And thou wentest to the king with oil, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thine ambassadors far off, and didst debase thyself even unto Sheol.	23
ASV	Isaiah	57	10	Thou wast wearied with the length of thy way; yet saidst thou not, It is in vain: thou didst find a quickening of thy strength; therefore thou wast not faint.	23
ASV	Isaiah	57	11	And of whom hast thou been afraid and in fear, that thou liest, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of long time, and thou fearest me not?	23
ASV	Isaiah	57	12	I will declare thy righteousness; and as for thy works, they shall not profit thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	57	13	When thou criest, let them that thou hast gathered deliver thee; but the wind shall take them, a breath shall carry them all away: but he that taketh refuge in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain.	23
ASV	Isaiah	57	14	And he will say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.	23
ASV	Isaiah	57	15	For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.	23
ASV	Isaiah	57	16	For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth; for the spirit would faint before me, and the souls that I have made.	23
ASV	Isaiah	57	17	For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him; I hid my face and was wroth; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.	23
ASV	Isaiah	57	18	I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.	23
ASV	Isaiah	57	19	I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near, saith Jehovah; and I will heal him.	23
ASV	Isaiah	57	20	But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it cannot rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.	23
ASV	Isaiah	57	21	There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.	23
ASV	Isaiah	58	1	Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and declare unto my people their transgression, and to the house of Jacob their sins.	23
ASV	Isaiah	58	2	Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways: as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God, they ask of me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near unto God.	23
ASV	Isaiah	58	3	Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find your own pleasure, and exact all your labors.	23
ASV	Isaiah	58	4	Behold, ye fast for strife and contention, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye fast not this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high.	23
ASV	Isaiah	58	5	Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to Jehovah?	23
ASV	Isaiah	58	6	Is not this the fast that I have chosen: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?	23
ASV	Isaiah	58	7	Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?	23
ASV	Isaiah	58	8	Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy healing shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of Jehovah shall by thy rearward.	23
ASV	Isaiah	58	9	Then shalt thou call, and Jehovah will answer; thou shalt cry, and he will say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedly;	23
ASV	Isaiah	58	10	and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul: then shall thy light rise in darkness, and thine obscurity be as the noonday;	23
ASV	Isaiah	58	11	and Jehovah will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in dry places, and make strong thy bones; and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.	23
ASV	Isaiah	58	12	And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places; thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.	23
ASV	Isaiah	58	13	If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, and the holy of Jehovah honorable; and shalt honor it, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own wo	23
ASV	Isaiah	58	14	then shalt thou delight thyself in Jehovah; and I will make thee to ride upon the high places of the earth; and I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.	23
ASV	Isaiah	59	1	Behold, Jehovahs hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:	23
ASV	Isaiah	59	2	but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, so that he will not hear.	23
ASV	Isaiah	59	3	For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue muttereth wickedness.	23
ASV	Isaiah	59	4	None sueth in righteousness, and none pleadeth in truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.	23
ASV	Isaiah	59	5	They hatch adders eggs, and weave the spiders web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth; and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.	23
ASV	Isaiah	59	6	Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.	23
ASV	Isaiah	59	7	Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; desolation and destruction are in their paths.	23
ASV	Isaiah	59	8	The way of peace they know not; and there is no justice in their goings: they have made them crooked paths; whosoever goeth therein doth not know peace.	23
ASV	Isaiah	59	9	Therefore is justice far from us, neither doth righteousness overtake us: we look for light, but, behold, darkness; for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.	23
ASV	Isaiah	59	10	We grope for the wall like the blind; yea, we grope as they that have no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the twilight; among them that are lusty we are as dead men.	23
ASV	Isaiah	59	11	We roar all like bears, and moan sore like doves: we look for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.	23
ASV	Isaiah	59	12	For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know them:	23
ASV	Isaiah	59	13	transgressing and denying Jehovah, and turning away from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.	23
ASV	Isaiah	59	14	And justice is turned away backward, and righteousness standeth afar off; for truth is fallen in the street, and uprightness cannot enter.	23
ASV	Isaiah	59	15	Yea, truth is lacking; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey. And Jehovah saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.	23
ASV	Isaiah	59	16	And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his own arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it upheld him.	23
ASV	Isaiah	59	17	And he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle.	23
ASV	Isaiah	59	18	According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompense.	23
ASV	Isaiah	59	19	So shall they fear the name of Jehovah from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he will come as a rushing stream, which the breath of Jehovah driveth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	59	20	And a Redeemer will come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith Jehovah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	59	21	And as for me, this is my covenant with them, saith Jehovah: my Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seed, saith Jehova	23
ASV	Isaiah	60	1	Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of Jehovah is risen upon thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	60	2	For, behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the peoples; but Jehovah will arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	60	3	And nations shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.	23
ASV	Isaiah	60	4	Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: they all gather themselves together, they come to thee; thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be carried in the arms.	23
ASV	Isaiah	60	5	Then thou shalt see and be radiant, and thy heart shall thrill and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be turned unto thee, the wealth of the nations shall come unto thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	60	6	The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come; they shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall proclaim the praises of Jehovah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	60	7	All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee; they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar; and I will glorify the house of my glory.	23
ASV	Isaiah	60	8	Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?	23
ASV	Isaiah	60	9	Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, for the name of Jehovah thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	60	10	And foreigners shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favor have I had mercy on thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	60	11	Thy gates also shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the wealth of the nations, and their kings led captive.	23
ASV	Isaiah	60	12	For that nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.	23
ASV	Isaiah	60	13	The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir-tree, the pine, and the box-tree together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.	23
ASV	Isaiah	60	14	And the sons of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee The city of Jehovah, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.	23
ASV	Isaiah	60	15	Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man passed through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations.	23
ASV	Isaiah	60	16	Thou shalt also suck the milk of the nations, and shalt suck the breast of kings; and thou shalt know that I, Jehovah, am thy Saviour, and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.	23
ASV	Isaiah	60	17	For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron. I will also make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness.	23
ASV	Isaiah	60	18	Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, desolation nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.	23
ASV	Isaiah	60	19	The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but Jehovah will be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.	23
ASV	Isaiah	60	20	Thy sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon withdraw itself; for Jehovah will be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.	23
ASV	Isaiah	60	21	Thy people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.	23
ASV	Isaiah	60	22	The little one shall become a thousand, and the small one a strong nation; I, Jehovah, will hasten it in its time.	23
ASV	Isaiah	61	1	The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me; because Jehovah hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;	23
ASV	Isaiah	61	2	to proclaim the year of Jehovahs favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;	23
ASV	Isaiah	61	3	to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called trees of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah, that he may be glorifi	23
ASV	Isaiah	61	4	And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.	23
ASV	Isaiah	61	5	And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vine-dressers.	23
ASV	Isaiah	61	6	But ye shall be named the priests of Jehovah; men shall call you the ministers of our God: ye shall eat the wealth of the nations, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.	23
ASV	Isaiah	61	7	Instead of your shame ye shall have double; and instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess double; everlasting joy shall be unto them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	61	8	For I, Jehovah, love justice, I hate robbery with iniquity; and I will give them their recompense in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	61	9	And their seed shall be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples; all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which Jehovah hath blessed.	23
ASV	Isaiah	61	10	I will greatly rejoice in Jehovah, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with a garland, and as a bride adorneth herself	23
ASV	Isaiah	61	11	For as the earth bringeth forth its bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord Jehovah will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.	23
ASV	Isaiah	62	1	For Zions sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalems sake I will not rest, until her righteousness go forth as brightness, and her salvation as a lamp that burneth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	62	2	And the nations shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory, and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of Jehovah shall name.	23
ASV	Isaiah	62	3	Thou shalt also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Jehovah, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.	23
ASV	Isaiah	62	4	Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah; for Jehovah delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.	23
ASV	Isaiah	62	5	For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee; and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.	23
ASV	Isaiah	62	6	I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem; they shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that are Jehovahs remembrancers, take ye no rest,	23
ASV	Isaiah	62	7	and give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	62	8	Jehovah hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy grain to be food for thine enemies; and foreigners shall not drink thy new wine, for which thou hast labored:	23
ASV	Isaiah	62	9	but they that have garnered it shall eat it, and praise Jehovah; and they that have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.	23
ASV	Isaiah	62	10	Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up an ensign for the peoples.	23
ASV	Isaiah	62	11	Behold, Jehovah hath proclaimed unto the end of the earth, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.	23
ASV	Isaiah	62	12	And they shall call them The holy people, The redeemed of Jehovah: and thou shalt be called Sought out, A city not forsaken.	23
ASV	Isaiah	63	1	Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, marching in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.	23
ASV	Isaiah	63	2	Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winevat?	23
ASV	Isaiah	63	3	I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the peoples there was no man with me: yea, I trod them in mine anger, and trampled them in my wrath; and their lifeblood is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have stained all my raiment.	23
ASV	Isaiah	63	4	For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.	23
ASV	Isaiah	63	5	And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my wrath, it upheld me.	23
ASV	Isaiah	63	6	And I trod down the peoples in mine anger, and made them drunk in my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.	23
ASV	Isaiah	63	7	I will make mention of the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah, and the praises of Jehovah, according to all that Jehovah hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and accordin	23
ASV	Isaiah	63	8	For he said, Surely, they are my people, children that will not deal falsely: so he was their Saviour.	23
ASV	Isaiah	63	9	In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.	23
ASV	Isaiah	63	10	But they rebelled, and grieved his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and himself fought against them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	63	11	Then he remembered the days of old, Moses and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit in the midst of them?	23
ASV	Isaiah	63	12	that caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses? that divided the waters before them, to make himself an everlasting name?	23
ASV	Isaiah	63	13	that led them through the depths, as a horse in the wilderness, so that they stumbled not?	23
ASV	Isaiah	63	14	As the cattle that go down into the valley, the Spirit of Jehovah caused them to rest; so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.	23
ASV	Isaiah	63	15	Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where are thy zeal and thy mighty acts? the yearning of thy heart and thy compassions are restrained toward me.	23
ASV	Isaiah	63	16	For thou art our Father, though Abraham knoweth us not, and Israel doth not acknowledge us: thou, O Jehovah, art our Father; our Redeemer from everlasting is thy name.	23
ASV	Isaiah	63	17	O Jehovah, why dost thou make us to err from thy ways, and hardenest our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.	23
ASV	Isaiah	63	18	Thy holy people possessed it but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.	23
ASV	Isaiah	63	19	We are become as they over whom thou never barest rule, as they that were not called by thy name.	23
ASV	Isaiah	64	1	Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might quake at thy presence,	23
ASV	Isaiah	64	2	as when fire kindleth the brushwood, and the fire causeth the waters to boil; to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!	23
ASV	Isaiah	64	3	When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains quaked at thy presence.	23
ASV	Isaiah	64	4	For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen a God besides thee, who worketh for him that waiteth for him.	23
ASV	Isaiah	64	5	Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou wast wroth, and we sinned: in them have we been of long time; and shall we be saved?	23
ASV	Isaiah	64	6	For we are all become as one that is unclean, and all our righteousnesses are as a polluted garment: and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.	23
ASV	Isaiah	64	7	And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee; for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us by means of our iniquities.	23
ASV	Isaiah	64	8	But now, O Jehovah, thou art our Father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.	23
ASV	Isaiah	64	9	Be not wroth very sore, O Jehovah, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, look, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.	23
ASV	Isaiah	64	10	Thy holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.	23
ASV	Isaiah	64	11	Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned with fire; and all our pleasant places are laid waste.	23
ASV	Isaiah	64	12	Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O Jehovah? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	1	I am inquired of by them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	2	I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, that walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	3	a people that provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense upon bricks;	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	4	that sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places; that eat swines flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	5	that say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	6	Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, yea, I will recompense into their bosom,	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	7	your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith Jehovah, that have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills; therefore will I first measure their work into their bosom.	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	8	Thus saith Jehovah, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants sake, that I may not destroy them all.	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	9	And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	10	And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	11	But ye that forsake Jehovah, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for Fortune, and that fill up mingled wine unto Destiny;	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	12	I will destine you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but ye did that which was evil in mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delighted not.	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	13	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be put to shame;	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	14	behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit.	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	15	And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen; and the Lord Jehovah will slay thee; and he will call his servants by another name:	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	16	so that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	17	For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	18	But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	19	And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying.	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	20	There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days; for the child shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	21	And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	22	They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	23	They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity; for they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them.	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	24	And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.	23
ASV	Isaiah	65	25	The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpents food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith Jehovah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	1	Thus saith Jehovah, Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: what manner of house will ye build unto me? and what place shall be my rest?	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	2	For all these things hath my hand made, and so all these things came to be, saith Jehovah: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and that trembleth at my word.	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	3	He that killeth an ox is as he that slayeth a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as he that breaketh a dogs neck; he that offereth an oblation, as he that offereth swines blood; he that burneth frankincense, as he that blesseth an idol. Yea, they have chose	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	4	I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did that which was evil in mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delighted not.	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	5	Hear the word of Jehovah, ye that tremble at his word: Your brethren that hate you, that cast you out for my names sake, have said, Let Jehovah be glorified, that we may see your joy; but it is they that shall be put to shame.	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	6	A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of Jehovah that rendereth recompense to his enemies.	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	7	Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man-child.	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	8	Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? shall a nation be brought forth at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	9	Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith Jehovah: shall I that cause to bring forth shut the womb? saith thy God.	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	10	Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn over her;	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	11	that ye may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	12	For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream: and ye shall suck thereof; ye shall be borne upon the side, and shall be dandled upon the knees.	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	13	As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	14	And ye shall see it, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass: and the hand of Jehovah shall be known toward his servants; and he will have indignation against his enemies.	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	15	For, behold, Jehovah will come with fire, and his chariots shall be like the whirlwind; to render his anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with flames of fire.	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	16	For by fire will Jehovah execute judgment, and by his sword, upon all flesh; and the slain of Jehovah shall be many.	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	17	They that sanctify themselves and purify themselves to go unto the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating swines flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, they shall come to an end together, saith Jehovah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	18	For I know their works and their thoughts: the time cometh, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and shall see my glory.	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	19	And I will set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall dec	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	20	And they shall bring all your brethren out of all the nations for an oblation unto Jehovah, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith Jehovah, as the children of Israel bring t	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	21	And of them also will I take for priests and for Levites, saith Jehovah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	22	For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith Jehovah, so shall your seed and your name remain.	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	23	And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith Jehovah.	23
ASV	Isaiah	66	24	And they shall go forth, and look upon the dead bodies of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.	23
ASV	Jeremiah	1	1	The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	1	2	to whom the word of Jehovah came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	1	3	It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	1	4	Now the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	1	5	Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee, and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee; I have appointed thee a prophet unto the nations.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	1	6	Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! behold, I know not how to speak; for I am a child.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	1	7	But Jehovah said unto me, Say not, I am a child; for to whomsoever I shall send thee thou shalt go, and whatsoever I shall command thee thou shalt speak.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	1	8	Be not afraid because of them; for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	1	9	Then Jehovah put forth his hand, and touched my mouth; and Jehovah said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	1	10	see, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	1	11	Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond-tree.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	1	12	Then said Jehovah unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I watch over my word to perform it.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	1	13	And the word of Jehovah came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a boiling caldron; and the face thereof is from the north.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	1	14	Then Jehovah said unto me, Out of the north evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	1	15	For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith Jehovah; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the c	24
ASV	Jeremiah	1	16	And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	1	17	Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at them, lest I dismay thee before them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	1	18	For, behold, I have made thee this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	1	19	And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee, saith Jehovah, to deliver thee.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	1	And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	2	Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals; how thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	3	Israel was holiness unto Jehovah, the first-fruits of his increase: all that devour him shall be held guilty; evil shall come upon them, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	4	Hear ye the word of Jehovah, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	5	thus saith Jehovah, What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	6	Neither said they, Where is Jehovah that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought and of the shadow of death, through a land that none passed through, and	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	7	And I brought you into a plentiful land, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	8	The priests said not, Where is Jehovah? and they that handle the law knew me not: the rulers also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	9	Wherefore I will yet contend with you, saith Jehovah, and with your childrens children will I contend.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	10	For pass over to the isles of Kittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently; and see if there hath been such a thing.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	11	Hath a nation changed its gods, which yet are no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	12	Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	13	For my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	14	Is Israel a servant? is he a home-born slave? why is he become a prey?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	15	The young lions have roared upon him, and yelled; and they have made his land waste: his cities are burned up, without inhabitant.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	16	The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of thy head.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	17	Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken Jehovah thy God, when he led thee by the way?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	18	And now what hast thou to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor? or what hast thou to do in the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	19	Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and a bitter, that thou hast forsaken Jehovah thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	20	For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bonds; and thou saidst, I will not serve; for upon every high hill and under every green tree thou didst bow thyself, playing the harlot.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	21	Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine unto me?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	22	For though thou wash thee with lye, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	23	How canst thou say, I am not defiled, I have not gone after the Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	24	a wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind in her desire; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	25	Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, It is in vain; no, for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	26	As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	27	who say to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	28	But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	29	Wherefore will ye contend with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	30	In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	31	O generation, see ye the word of Jehovah. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? or a land of thick darkness? wherefore say my people, We are broken loose; we will come no more unto thee?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	32	Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	33	How trimmest thou thy way to seek love! therefore even the wicked women hast thou taught thy ways.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	34	Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor: thou didst not find them breaking in; but it is because of all these things.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	35	Yet thou saidst, I am innocent; surely his anger is turned away from me. Behold, I will enter into judgment with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	36	Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt also, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	2	37	From thence also shalt thou go forth, with thy hands upon thy head: for Jehovah hath rejected those in whom thou trustest, and thou shalt not prosper with them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	1	They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another mans, will he return unto her again? will not that land be greatly polluted? But thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	2	Lift up thine eyes unto the bare heights, and see; where hast thou not been lain with? By the ways hast thou sat for them, as an Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	3	Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; yet thou hast a harlots forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	4	Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My Father, thou art the guide of my youth?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	5	Will he retain his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and hast done evil things, and hast had thy way.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	6	Moreover Jehovah said unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	7	And I said after she had done all these things, She will return unto me; but she returned not: and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	8	And I saw, when, for this very cause that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorcement, yet treacherous Judah her sister feared not; but she also went and played the harlot.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	9	And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	10	And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not returned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	11	And Jehovah said unto me, Backsliding Israel hath showed herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	12	Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith Jehovah; I will not look in anger upon you; for I am merciful, saith Jehovah, I will not keep anger for ever.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	13	Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against Jehovah thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	14	Return, O backsliding children, saith Jehovah; for I am a husband unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	15	and I will give you shepherds according to my heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	16	And it shall come to pass, when ye are multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith Jehovah, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of Jehovah; neither shall it come to mind; neither shall they remember it; neither shall they miss i	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	17	At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of Jehovah, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	18	In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance unto your fathers.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	19	But I said, How I will put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of the nations! and I said, Ye shall call me My Father, and shall not turn away from following me.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	20	Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	21	A voice is heard upon the bare heights, the weeping and the supplications of the children of Israel; because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten Jehovah their God.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	22	Return, ye backsliding children, I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we are come unto thee; for thou art Jehovah our God.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	23	Truly in vain is the help that is looked for from the hills, the tumult on the mountains: truly in Jehovah our God is the salvation of Israel.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	24	But the shameful thing hath devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	3	25	Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us; for we have sinned against Jehovah our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day; and we have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	1	If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith Jehovah, if thou wilt return unto me, and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight; then shalt thou not be removed;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	2	and thou shalt swear, As Jehovah liveth, in truth, in justice, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	3	For thus saith Jehovah to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	4	Circumcise yourselves to Jehovah, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	5	Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry aloud and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	6	Set up a standard toward Zion: flee for safety, stay not; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	7	A lion is gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations; he is on his way, he is gone forth from his place, to make thy land desolate, that thy cities be laid waste, without inhabitant.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	8	For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of Jehovah is not turned back from us.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	9	And it shall come to pass at that day, saith Jehovah, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	10	Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the life.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	11	At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	12	a full wind from these shall come for me: now will I also utter judgments against them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	13	Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as the whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are ruined.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	14	O Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thine evil thoughts lodge within thee?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	15	For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth evil from the hills of Ephraim:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	16	make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	17	As keepers of a field are they against her round about, because she hath been rebellious against me, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	18	Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness; for it is bitter, for it reacheth unto thy heart.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	19	My anguish, my anguish! I am pained at my very heart; my heart is disquieted in me; I cannot hold my peace; because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	20	Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is laid waste: suddenly are my tents destroyed, and my curtains in a moment.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	21	How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	22	For my people are foolish, they know me not; they are sottish children, and they have no understanding; they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	23	I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was waste and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	24	I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved to and fro.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	25	I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	26	I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of Jehovah, and before his fierce anger.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	27	For thus saith Jehovah, The whole land shall be a desolation; yet will I not make a full end.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	28	For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and I have not repented, neither will I turn back from it.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	29	Every city fleeth for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they go into the thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city is forsaken, and not a man dwelleth therein.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	30	And thou, when thou art made desolate, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with scarlet, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou enlargest thine eyes with paint, in vain dost thou make thyself fair; thy lovers despise thee	24
ASV	Jeremiah	4	31	For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that gaspeth for breath, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul fainteth before the murd	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	1	Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that doeth justly, that seeketh truth; and I will pardon her.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	2	And though they say, As Jehovah liveth; surely they swear falsely.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	3	O Jehovah, do not thine eyes look upon truth? thou hast stricken them, but they were not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	4	Then I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish; for they know not the way of Jehovah, nor the law of their God:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	5	I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they know the way of Jehovah, and the law of their God. But these with one accord have broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	6	Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, a wolf of the evenings shall destroy them, a leopard shall watch against their cities; every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces; because their transgressions are many, and their backslidin	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	7	How can I pardon thee? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they committed adultery, and assembled themselves in troops at the harlots houses.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	8	They were as fed horses roaming at large; every one neighed after his neighbors wife.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	9	Shall I not visit for these things? saith Jehovah; and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	10	Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her branches; for they are not Jehovahs.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	11	For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	12	They have denied Jehovah, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	13	and the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	14	Wherefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	15	Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith Jehovah: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	16	Their quiver is an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	17	And they shall eat up thy harvest, and thy bread, which thy sons and thy daughters should eat; they shall eat up thy flocks and thy herds; they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig-trees; they shall beat down thy fortified cities, wherein thou trustest, wit	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	18	But even in those days, saith Jehovah, I will not make a full end with you.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	19	And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore hath Jehovah our God done all these things unto us? then shalt thou say unto them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served foreign gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	20	Declare ye this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	21	Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; that have eyes, and see not; that have ears, and hear not:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	22	Fear ye not me? saith Jehovah: will ye not tremble at my presence, who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea, by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it? and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	23	But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	24	Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear Jehovah our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in its season; that preserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	25	Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withholden good from you.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	26	For among my people are found wicked men: they watch, as fowlers lie in wait; they set a trap, they catch men.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	27	As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxed rich.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	28	They are waxed fat, they shine: yea, they overpass in deeds of wickedness; they plead not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, that they may prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	29	Shall I not visit for these things? saith Jehovah; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	30	A wonderful and horrible thing is come to pass in the land:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	5	31	the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	1	Flee for safety, ye children of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise up a signal on Beth-haccherem; for evil looketh forth from the north, and a great destruction.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	2	The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, will I cut off.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	3	Shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	4	Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day declineth, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	5	Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	6	For thus hath Jehovah of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	7	As a well casteth forth its waters, so she casteth forth her wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually is sickness and wounds.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	8	Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from thee; lest I make thee a desolation, a land not inhabited.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	9	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn again thy hand as a grape-gatherer into the baskets.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	10	To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of Jehovah is become unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	11	Therefore I am full of the wrath of Jehovah; I am weary with holding in: pour it out upon the children in the street, and upon the assembly of young men together; for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	12	And their houses shall be turned unto others, their fields and their wives together; for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	13	For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	14	They have healed also the hurt of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	15	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall; at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	16	Thus saith Jehovah, Stand ye in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way; and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls: but they said, We will not walk therein.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	17	And I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet; but they said, We will not hearken.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	18	Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	19	Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	20	To what purpose cometh there to me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt-offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing unto me.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	21	Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people; and the fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	22	Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, a people cometh from the north country; and a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	23	They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea, and they ride upon horses, every one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Zion.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	24	We have heard the report thereof; our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, and pangs as of a woman in travail.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	25	Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy, and terror, are on every side.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	26	O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	27	I have made thee a trier and a fortress among my people; that thou mayest know and try their way.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	28	They are all grievous revolters, going about with slanders; they are brass and iron: they all of them deal corruptly.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	29	The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire: in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are not plucked away.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	6	30	Refuse silver shall men them, because Jehovah hath rejected them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	1	The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	2	Stand in the gate of Jehovahs house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of Jehovah, all ye of Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	3	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	4	Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, are these.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	5	For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbor;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	6	if ye oppress not the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your own hurt:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	7	then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, from of old even for evermore.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	8	Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	9	Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods that ye have not known,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	10	and come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered; that ye may do all these abominations?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	11	Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I, even I, have seen it, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	12	But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	13	And now, because ye have done all these works, saith Jehovah, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	14	therefore will I do unto the house which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	15	And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	16	Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me; for I will not hear thee.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	17	Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	18	The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	19	Do they provoke me to anger? saith Jehovah; do they not provoke themselves, to the confusion of their own faces?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	20	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, mine anger and my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	21	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Add your burnt-offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat ye flesh.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	22	For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	23	but this thing I commanded them, saying, Hearken unto my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people; and walk ye in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	24	But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in their own counsels and in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	25	Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day, I have sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	26	yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff: they did worse than their fathers.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	27	And thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	28	And thou shalt say unto them, This is the nation that hath not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah their God, nor received instruction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	29	Cut off thy hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on the bare heights; for Jehovah hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	30	For the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight, saith Jehovah: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	31	And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded not, neither came it into my mind.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	32	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that it shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter: for they shall bury in Topheth, till there be no place to bury.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	33	And the dead bodies of this people shall be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall frighten them away.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	7	34	Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land shall become a waste.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	8	1	At that time, saith Jehovah, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	8	2	and they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, which they have loved, and which they have served, and after which they have walked, and which they have sought, and which they have worshipped: they shall not be gathere	24
ASV	Jeremiah	8	3	And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family, that remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith Jehovah of hosts.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	8	4	Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah: Shall men fall, and not rise up again? Shall one turn away, and not return?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	8	5	Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	8	6	I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repenteth him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turneth to his course, as a horse that rusheth headlong in the battle.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	8	7	Yea, the stork in the heavens knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle-dove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the law of Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	8	8	How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of Jehovah is with us? But, behold, the false pen of the scribes hath wrought falsely.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	8	9	The wise men are put to shame, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of Jehovah; and what manner of wisdom is in them?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	8	10	Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that shall possess them: for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness; from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	8	11	And they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	8	12	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall; in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	8	13	I will utterly consume them, saith Jehovah: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig-tree, and the leaf shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	8	14	Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us be silent there; for Jehovah our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	8	15	We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and, behold, dismay!	24
ASV	Jeremiah	8	16	The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan: at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones the whole land trembleth; for they are come, and have devoured the land and all that is in it; the city and those that dwell therein.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	8	17	For, behold, I will send serpents, adders, among you, which will not be charmed; and they shall bite you, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	8	18	Oh that I could comfort myself against sorrow! my heart is faint within me.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	8	19	Behold, the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land that is very far off: is not Jehovah in Zion? is not her King in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with foreign vanities?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	8	20	The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	8	21	For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt: I mourn; dismay hath taken hold on me.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	8	22	Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	1	Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	2	Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging-place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	3	And they bend their tongue, as it were their bow, for falsehood; and they are grown strong in the land, but not for truth: for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	4	Take ye heed every one of his neighbor, and trust ye not in any brother; for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbor will go about with slanders.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	5	And they will deceive every one his neighbor, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies; they weary themselves to commit iniquity.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	6	Thy habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	7	Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how else should I do, because of the daughter of my people?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	8	Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in his heart he layeth wait for him.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	9	Shall I not visit them for these things? saith Jehovah; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	10	For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none passeth through; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the birds of the heavens and the bea	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	11	And I will make Jerusalem heaps, a dwelling-place of jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	12	Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken, that he may declare it? wherefore is the land perished and burned up like a wilderness, so that none passeth through?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	13	And Jehovah saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	14	but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Baalim, which their fathers taught them;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	15	therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	16	I will scatter them also among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	17	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for the skilful women, that they may come:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	18	and let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	19	For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we ruined! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because they have cast down our dwellings.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	20	Yet hear the word of Jehovah, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth; and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbor lamentation.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	21	For death is come up into our windows, it is entered into our palaces; to cut off the children from without, and the young men from the streets.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	22	Speak, Thus saith Jehovah, The dead bodies of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman; and none shall gather them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	23	Thus saith Jehovah, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	24	but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he hath understanding, and knoweth me, that I am Jehovah who exerciseth lovingkindness, justice, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	25	Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will punish all them that are circumcised in their uncircumcision:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	9	26	Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that have the corners of their hair cut off, that dwell in the wilderness; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	1	Hear ye the word which Jehovah speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	2	thus saith Jehovah, Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the nations are dismayed at them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	3	For the customs of the peoples are vanity; for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the axe.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	4	They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	5	They are like a palm-tree, of turned work, and speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	6	There is none like unto thee, O Jehovah; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	7	Who should not fear thee, O King of the nations? for to thee doth it appertain; forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like unto thee.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	8	But they are together brutish and foolish: the instruction of idols! it is but a stock.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	9	There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing; they are all the work of skilful men.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	10	But Jehovah is the true God; he is the living God, and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth trembleth, and the nations are not able to abide his indignation.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	11	Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	12	He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	13	when he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	14	Every man is become brutish and is without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his graven image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	15	They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	16	The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: Jehovah of hosts is his name.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	17	Gather up thy wares out of the land, O thou that abidest in the siege.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	18	For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may feel it.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	19	Woe is me because of my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is my grief, and I must bear it.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	20	My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth from me, and they are not: there is none to spread my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	21	For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired of Jehovah: therefore they have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	22	The voice of tidings, behold, it cometh, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling-place of jackals.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	23	O Jehovah, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	24	O Jehovah, correct me, but in measure: not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	10	25	Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have devoured Jacob, yea, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	11	1	The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	11	2	Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	11	3	and say thou unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Cursed be the man that heareth not the words of this covenant,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	11	4	which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	11	5	that I may establish the oath which I sware unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day. Then answered I, and said, Amen, O Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	11	6	And Jehovah said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	11	7	For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	11	8	Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the stubbornness of their evil heart: therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did them not.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	11	9	And Jehovah said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	11	10	They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words; and they are gone after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	11	11	Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and they shall cry unto me, but I will not hearken unto them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	11	12	Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto which they offer incense: but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	11	13	For according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	11	14	Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me because of their trouble.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	11	15	What hath my beloved to do in my house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	11	16	Jehovah called thy name, A green olive-tree, fair with goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	11	17	For Jehovah of hosts, who planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have wrought for themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense unto Baal.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	11	18	And Jehovah gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it: then thou showedst me their doings.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	11	19	But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more re	24
ASV	Jeremiah	11	20	But, O Jehovah of hosts, who judgest righteously, who triest the heart and the mind, I shall see thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I revealed my cause.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	11	21	Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of Jehovah, that thou die not by our hand;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	11	22	therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	11	23	and there shall be no remnant unto them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	12	1	Righteous art thou, O Jehovah, when I contend with thee; yet would I reason the cause with thee: wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they at ease that deal very treacherously?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	12	2	Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root; they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their heart.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	12	3	But thou, O Jehovah, knowest me; thou seest me, and triest my heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	12	4	How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole country wither? for the wickedness of them that dwell therein, the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our latter end.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	12	5	If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and though in a land of peace thou art secure, yet how wilt thou do in the pride of the Jordan?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	12	6	For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; even they have cried aloud after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	12	7	I have forsaken my house, I have cast off my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	12	8	My heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest: she hath uttered her voice against me; therefore I have hated her.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	12	9	Is my heritage unto me as a speckled bird of prey? are the birds of prey against her round about? go ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, bring them to devour.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	12	10	Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	12	11	They have made it a desolation; it mourneth unto me, being desolate; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	12	12	Destroyers are come upon all the bare heights in the wilderness; for the sword of Jehovah devoureth from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh hath peace.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	12	13	They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns; they have put themselves to pain, and profit nothing: and ye shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	12	14	Thus saith Jehovah against all mine evil neighbors, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	12	15	And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them; and I will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	12	16	And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, As Jehovah liveth; even as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built up in the midst of my people.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	12	17	But if they will not hear, then will I pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	1	Thus saith Jehovah unto me, Go, and buy thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	2	So I bought a girdle according to the word of Jehovah, and put it upon my loins.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	3	And the word of Jehovah came unto me the second time, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	4	Take the girdle that thou hast bought, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	5	So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as Jehovah commanded me.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	6	And it came to pass after many days, that Jehovah said unto me, Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	7	Then I went to the Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it; and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	8	Then the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	9	Thus saith Jehovah, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	10	This evil people, that refuse to hear my words, that walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and are gone after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is profitable for nothing.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	11	For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith Jehovah; that they may be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	12	Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word: Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	13	Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon Davids throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	14	And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith Jehovah: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have compassion, that I should not destroy them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	15	Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud; for Jehovah hath spoken.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	16	Give glory to Jehovah your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	17	But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because Jehovahs flock is taken captive.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	18	Say thou unto the king and to the queen-mother, Humble yourselves, sit down; for your headtires are come down, even the crown of your glory.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	19	The cities of the South are shut up, and there is none to open them: Judah is carried away captive, all of it; it is wholly carried away captive.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	20	Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	21	What wilt thou say, when he shall set over thee as head those whom thou hast thyself taught to be friends to thee? shall not sorrows take hold of thee, as of a woman in travail?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	22	And if thou say in thy heart, Wherefore are these things come upon me? for the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts uncovered, and thy heels suffer violence.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	23	Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	24	Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that passeth away, by the wind of the wilderness.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	25	This is thy lot, the portion measured unto thee from me, saith Jehovah; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	26	Therefore will I also uncover thy skirts upon thy face, and thy shame shall appear.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	13	27	I have seen thine abominations, even thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, on the hills in the field. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! thou wilt not be made clean; how long shall it yet be?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	14	1	The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	14	2	Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish, they sit in black upon the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	14	3	And their nobles send their little ones to the waters: they come to the cisterns, and find no water; they return with their vessels empty; they are put to shame and confounded, and cover their heads.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	14	4	Because of the ground which is cracked, for that no rain hath been in the land, the plowmen are put to shame, they cover their heads.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	14	5	Yea, the hind also in the field calveth, and forsaketh her young, because there is no grass.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	14	6	And the wild asses stand on the bare heights, they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail, because there is no herbage.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	14	7	Though our iniquities testify against us, work thou for thy names sake, O Jehovah; for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	14	8	O thou hope of Israel, the Saviour thereof in the time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a sojourner in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	14	9	Why shouldest thou be as a man affrighted, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet thou, O Jehovah, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	14	10	Thus saith Jehovah unto this people, Even so have they loved to wander; they have not refrained their feet: therefore Jehovah doth not accept them; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	14	11	And Jehovah said unto me, Pray not for this people for their good.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	14	12	When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt-offering and meal-offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	14	13	Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	14	14	Then Jehovah said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name; I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake I unto them: they prophesy unto you a lying vision, and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their own heart.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	14	15	Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land: By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	14	16	And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them-them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon the	24
ASV	Jeremiah	14	17	And thou shalt say this word unto them, Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous wound.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	14	18	If I go forth into the field, then, behold, the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then, behold, they that are sick with famine! for both the prophet and the priest go about in the land, and have no knowledge.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	14	19	Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul loathed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and, behold, dismay!	24
ASV	Jeremiah	14	20	We acknowledge, O Jehovah, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against thee.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	14	21	Do not abhor us, for thy names sake; do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	14	22	Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O Jehovah our God? therefore we will wait for thee; for thou hast made all these things.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	15	1	Then said Jehovah unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind would not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	15	2	And it shall come to pass, when they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith Jehovah: Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and	24
ASV	Jeremiah	15	3	And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith Jehovah: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and to destroy.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	15	4	And I will cause them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	15	5	For who will have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who will bemoan thee? or who will turn aside to ask of thy welfare?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	15	6	Thou hast rejected me, saith Jehovah, thou art gone backward: therefore have I stretched out my hand against thee, and destroyed thee; I am weary with repenting.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	15	7	And I have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land; I have bereaved them of children, I have destroyed my people; they returned not from their ways.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	15	8	Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas; I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a destroyer at noonday: I have caused anguish and terrors to fall upon her suddenly.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	15	9	She that hath borne seven languisheth; she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day; she hath been put to shame and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	15	10	Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have not lent, neither have men lent to me; yet every one of them doth curse me.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	15	11	Jehovah said, Verily I will strengthen thee for good; verily I will cause the enemy to make supplication unto thee in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	15	12	Can one break iron, even iron from the north, and brass?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	15	13	Thy substance and thy treasures will I give for a spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	15	14	And I will make them to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not; for a fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	15	15	O Jehovah, thou knowest; remember me, and visit me, and avenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered reproach.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	15	16	Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy words were unto me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by thy name, O Jehovah, God of hosts.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	15	17	I sat not in the assembly of them that make merry, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand; for thou hast filled me with indignation.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	15	18	Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? wilt thou indeed be unto me as a deceitful brook, as waters that fail?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	15	19	Therefore thus saith Jehovah, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, that thou mayest stand before me; and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: they shall return unto thee, but thou shalt not return unto them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	15	20	And I will make thee unto this people a fortified brazen wall; and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	15	21	And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	16	1	The word of Jehovah came also unto me, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	16	2	Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters, in this place.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	16	3	For thus saith Jehovah concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	16	4	They shall die grievous deaths: they shall not be lamented, neither shall they be buried; they shall be as dung upon the face of the ground; and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the h	24
ASV	Jeremiah	16	5	For thus saith Jehovah, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament, neither bemoan them; for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith Jehovah, even lovingkindness and tender mercies.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	16	6	Both great and small shall die in this land; they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	16	7	neither shall men break bread for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	16	8	And thou shalt not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and to drink.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	16	9	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	16	10	And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt show this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath Jehovah pronounced all this great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or what is our sin that we have committed against Jehovah	24
ASV	Jeremiah	16	11	Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith Jehovah, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	16	12	and ye have done evil more than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart, so that ye hearken not unto me:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	16	13	therefore will I cast you forth out of this land into the land that ye have not known, neither ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; for I will show you no favor.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	16	14	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that it shall no more be said, As Jehovah liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	16	15	but, As Jehovah liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the countries whither he had driven them. And I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	16	16	Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith Jehovah, and they shall fish them up; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	16	17	For mine eyes are upon all their ways; they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity concealed from mine eyes.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	16	18	And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable things, and have filled mine inheritance with their abominations.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	16	19	O Jehovah, my strength, and my stronghold, and my refuge in the day of affliction, unto thee shall the nations come from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Our fathers have inherited nought but lies, even vanity and things wherein there is no profit.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	16	20	Shall a man make unto himself gods, which yet are no gods?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	16	21	Therefore, behold, I will cause them to know, this once will I cause them to know my hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	1	The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond: it is graven upon the tablet of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	2	whilst their children remember their altars and their Asherim by the green trees upon the high hills.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	3	O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and all thy treasures for a spoil, and thy high places, because of sin, throughout all thy borders.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	4	And thou, even of thyself, shalt discontinue from thy heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger which shall burn for ever.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	5	Thus saith Jehovah: Cursed is the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	6	For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh, but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, a salt land and not inhabited.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	7	Blessed is the man that trusteth in Jehovah, and whose trust Jehovah is.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	8	For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, that spreadeth out its roots by the river, and shall not fear when heat cometh, but its leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	9	The heart is deceitful above all things, and it is exceedingly corrupt: who can know it?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	10	I, Jehovah, search the mind, I try the heart, even to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his doings.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	11	As the partridge that sitteth on eggs which she hath not laid, so is he that getteth riches, and not by right; in the midst of his days they shall leave him, and at his end he shall be a fool.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	12	A glorious throne, set on high from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	13	O Jehovah, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be put to shame. They that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken Jehovah, the fountain of living waters.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	14	Heal me, O Jehovah, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for thou art my praise.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	15	Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of Jehovah? let it come now.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	16	As for me, I have not hastened from being a shepherd after thee; neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that which came out of my lips was before thy face.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	17	Be not a terror unto me: thou art my refuge in the day of evil.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	18	Let them be put to shame that persecute me, but let not me be put to shame; let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed; bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	19	Thus said Jehovah unto me: Go, and stand in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	20	and say unto them, Hear ye the word of Jehovah, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	21	Thus saith Jehovah, Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	22	neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work: but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	23	But they hearkened not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, and might not receive instruction.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	24	And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith Jehovah, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but to hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	25	then shall there enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city shall remain for ever.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	26	And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places round about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the lowland, and from the hill-country, and from the South, bringing burnt-offerings, and sacrifices, and meal-offerings, and	24
ASV	Jeremiah	17	27	But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall no	24
ASV	Jeremiah	18	1	The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	18	2	Arise, and go down to the potters house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	18	3	Then I went down to the potters house, and, behold, he was making a work on the wheels.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	18	4	And when the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the potter, he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	18	5	Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	18	6	O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith Jehovah. Behold, as the clay in the potters hand, so are ye in my hand, O house of Israel.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	18	7	At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	18	8	if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	18	9	And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	18	10	if they do that which is evil in my sight, that they obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	18	11	Now therefore, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and amend your ways and your doings.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	18	12	But they say, It is in vain; for we will walk after our own devices, and we will do every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	18	13	Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Ask ye now among the nations, who hath heard such things; the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	18	14	Shall the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field? or shall the cold waters that flow down from afar be dried up?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	18	15	For my people have forgotten me, they have burned incense to false gods; and they have been made to stumble in their ways, in the ancient paths, to walk in bypaths, in a way not cast up;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	18	16	to make their land an astonishment, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and shake his head.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	18	17	I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	18	18	Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his wo	24
ASV	Jeremiah	18	19	Give heed to me, O Jehovah, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	18	20	Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember how I stood before thee to speak good for them, to turn away thy wrath from them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	18	21	Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and give them over to the power of the sword; and let their wives become childless, and widows; and let their men be slain of death, and their young men smitten of the sword in battle.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	18	22	Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them; for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	18	23	Yet, Jehovah, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me; forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight; but let them be overthrown before thee; deal thou with them in the time of thine anger.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	19	1	Thus said Jehovah, Go, and buy a potters earthen bottle, and take of the elders of the people, and of the elders of the priests;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	19	2	and go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the gate Harsith, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	19	3	and say, Hear ye the word of Jehovah, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem: thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	19	4	Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, that they knew not, they and their fathers and the kings of Judah; and have filled this place with the blood of innocents,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	19	5	and have built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons in the fire for burnt-offerings unto Baal; which I commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	19	6	therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that this place shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	19	7	And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies will I give to be food for the birds of the heavens	24
ASV	Jeremiah	19	8	And I will make this city an astonishment, and a hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	19	9	And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters; and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend, in the siege and in the distress, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their life, shall distress them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	19	10	Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	19	11	and shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a potters vessel, that cannot be made whole again; and they shall bury in Topheth, till there be no place to bury.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	19	12	Thus will I do unto this place, saith Jehovah, and to the inhabitants thereof, even making this city as Topheth:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	19	13	and the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, which are defiled, shall be as the place of Topheth, even all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink-offerings unto oth	24
ASV	Jeremiah	19	14	Then came Jeremiah from Topheth, whither Jehovah had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of Jehovahs house, and said to all the people:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	19	15	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all its towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it; because they have made their neck stiff, that they may not hear my words.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	20	1	Now Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in the house of Jehovah, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	20	2	Then Pashhur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in the house of Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	20	3	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashhur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, Jehovah hath not called thy name Pashhur, but Magor-missabib.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	20	4	For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall c	24
ASV	Jeremiah	20	5	Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all the gains thereof, and all the precious things thereof, yea, all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies; and they shall make them a prey, and take them, and	24
ASV	Jeremiah	20	6	And thou, Pashhur, and all that dwell in thy house shall go into captivity; and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and there shalt thou be buried, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied falsely.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	20	7	O Jehovah, thou hast persuaded me, and I was persuaded; thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am become a laughing-stock all the day, every one mocketh me.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	20	8	For as often as I speak, I cry out; I cry, Violence and destruction! because the word of Jehovah is made a reproach unto me, and a derision, all the day.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	20	9	And if I say, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name, then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing, and I cannot contain.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	20	10	For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every side. Denounce, and we will denounce him, say all my familiar friends, they that watch for my fall; peradventure he will be persuaded, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge o	24
ASV	Jeremiah	20	11	But Jehovah is with me as a mighty one and a terrible: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail; they shall be utterly put to shame, because they have not dealt wisely, even with an everlasting dishonor which shall never be forgo	24
ASV	Jeremiah	20	12	But, O Jehovah of hosts, that triest the righteous, that seest the heart and the mind, let me see thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I revealed my cause.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	20	13	Sing unto Jehovah, praise ye Jehovah; for he hath delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evil-doers.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	20	14	Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	20	15	Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man-child is born unto thee; making him very glad.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	20	16	And let that man be as the cities which Jehovah overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear a cry in the morning, and shouting at noontime;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	20	17	because he slew me not from the womb; and so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb always great.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	20	18	Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	21	1	The word which came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashhur the son of Malchijah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	21	2	Inquire, I pray thee, of Jehovah for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us: peradventure Jehovah will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	21	3	Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	21	4	Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans that besiege you, without the walls; and I will gather them into the midst	24
ASV	Jeremiah	21	5	And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	21	6	And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	21	7	And afterward, saith Jehovah, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, even such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into t	24
ASV	Jeremiah	21	8	And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	21	9	He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that goeth out, and passeth over to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	21	10	For I have set my face upon this city for evil, and not for good, saith Jehovah: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	21	11	And touching the house of the king of Judah, hear ye the word of Jehovah:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	21	12	O house of David, thus saith Jehovah, Execute justice in the morning, and deliver him that is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	21	13	Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and of the rock of the plain, saith Jehovah; you that say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	21	14	And I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith Jehovah; and I will kindle a fire in her forest, and it shall devour all that is round about her.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	1	Thus said Jehovah: Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	2	And say, Hear the word of Jehovah, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter in by these gates.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	3	Thus saith Jehovah: Execute ye justice and righteousness, and deliver him that is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence, to the sojourner, the fatherless, nor the widow; neither shed innocent blood in this place.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	4	For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	5	But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith Jehovah, that this house shall become a desolation.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	6	For thus saith Jehovah concerning the house of the king of Judah: Thou art Gilead unto me, and the head of Lebanon; yet surely I will make thee a wilderness, and cities which are not inhabited.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	7	And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons; and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the fire.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	8	And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbor, Wherefore hath Jehovah done thus unto this great city?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	9	Then they shall answer, Because they forsook the covenant of Jehovah their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	10	Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him; but weep sore for him that goeth away; for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	11	For thus saith Jehovah touching Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, and who went forth out of this place: He shall not return thither any more.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	12	But in the place whither they have led him captive, there shall he die, and he shall see this land no more.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	13	Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by injustice; that useth his neighbors service without wages, and giveth him not his hire;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	14	that saith, I will build me a wide house and spacious chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is ceiled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	15	Shalt thou reign, because thou strivest to excel in cedar? Did not thy father eat and drink, and do justice and righteousness? then it was well with him.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	16	He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Was not this to know me? saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	17	But thine eyes and thy heart are not but for thy covetousness, and for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	18	Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! They shall not lament for him, saying Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	19	He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	20	Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry from Abarim; for all thy lovers are destroyed.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	21	I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	22	The wind shall feed all thy shepherds, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	23	O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how greatly to be pitied shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	24	As I live, saith Jehovah, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	25	and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them of whom thou art afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	26	And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	27	But to the land whereunto their soul longeth to return, thither shall they not return.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	28	Is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel? is he a vessel wherein none delighteth? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into the land which they know not?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	29	O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	22	30	Thus saith Jehovah, Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days; for no more shall a man of his seed prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling in Judah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	1	Woe unto the shepherds that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	2	Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, against the shepherds that feed my people: Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them; behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	3	And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and multiply.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	4	And I will set up shepherds over them, who shall feed them; and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be lacking, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	5	Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	6	In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is his name whereby he shall be called: Jehovah our righteousness.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	7	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that they shall no more say, As Jehovah liveth, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	8	but, As Jehovah liveth, who brought up and who led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries whither I had driven them. And they shall dwell in their own land.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	9	Concerning the prophets. My heart within me is broken, all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of Jehovah, and because of his holy words.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	10	For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. And their course is evil, and their might is not right;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	11	for both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	12	Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery places in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein; for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	13	And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied by Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	14	In the prophets of Jerusalem also I have seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies; and they strengthen the hands of evil-doers, so that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them become unto me as Sodom, and the inhabi	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	15	Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is ungodliness gone forth into all the land.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	16	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they teach you vanity; they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	17	They say continually unto them that despise me, Jehovah hath said, Ye shall have peace; and unto every one that walketh in the stubbornness of his own heart they say, No evil shall come upon you.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	18	For who hath stood in the council of Jehovah, that he should perceive and hear his word? who hath marked my word, and heard it?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	19	Behold, the tempest of Jehovah, even his wrath, is gone forth, yea, a whirling tempest: it shall burst upon the head of the wicked.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	20	The anger of Jehovah shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall understand it perfectly.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	21	I sent not these prophets, yet they ran: I spake not unto them, yet they prophesied.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	22	But if they had stood in my council, then had they caused my people to hear my words, and had turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	23	Am I a God at hand, saith Jehovah, and not a God afar off?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	24	Can any hide himself in secret places so that I shall not see him? saith Jehovah. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	25	I have heard what the prophets have said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	26	How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	27	that think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor, as their fathers forgat my name for Baal.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	28	The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the straw to the wheat? saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	29	Is not my word like fire? saith Jehovah; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	30	Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith Jehovah, that steal my words every one from his neighbor.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	31	Behold, I am against the prophets, saith Jehovah, that use their tongues, and say, He saith.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	32	Behold, I am against them that prophesy lying dreams, saith Jehovah, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their vain boasting: yet I sent them not, nor commanded them; neither do they profit this people at all, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	33	And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of Jehovah? then shalt thou say unto them, What burden! I will cast you off, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	34	And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of Jehovah, I will even punish that man and his house.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	35	Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbor, and every one to his brother, What hath Jehovah answered? and, What hath Jehovah spoken?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	36	And the burden of Jehovah shall ye mention no more: for every mans own word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of Jehovah of hosts our God.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	37	Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath Jehovah answered thee? and, What hath Jehovah spoken?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	38	But if ye say, The burden of Jehovah; therefore thus saith Jehovah: Because ye say this word, The burden of Jehovah, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of Jehovah;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	39	therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off, and the city that I gave unto you and to your fathers, away from my presence:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	23	40	and I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	24	1	Jehovah showed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs set before the temple of Jehovah, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	24	2	One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first-ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	24	3	Then said Jehovah unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	24	4	And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	24	5	Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for good.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	24	6	For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	24	7	And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Jehovah: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God; for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	24	8	And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad, surely thus saith Jehovah, So will I give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	24	9	I will even give them up to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	24	10	And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	1	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (the same was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,)	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	2	which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	3	From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even unto this day, these three and twenty years, the word of Jehovah hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising up early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	4	And Jehovah hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, (but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear,)	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	5	saying, Return ye now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that Jehovah hath given unto you and to your fathers, from of old and even for evermore;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	6	and go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the work of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	7	Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith Jehovah; that ye may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	8	Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Because ye have not heard my words,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	9	behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith Jehovah, and I will send unto Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	10	Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	11	And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	12	And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith Jehovah, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans; and I will make it desolate for ever.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	13	And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	14	For many nations and great kings shall make bondmen of them, even of them; and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	15	For thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto me: take this cup of the wine of wrath at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	16	And they shall drink, and reel to and fro, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	17	Then took I the cup at Jehovahs hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom Jehovah had sent me:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	18	to wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	19	Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	20	and all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of the Uz, and all the kings of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Gaza, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	21	Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	22	and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	23	Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that have the corners of their hair cut off;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	24	and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the wilderness;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	25	and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	26	and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	27	And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink ye, and be drunken, and spew, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	28	And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thy hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Ye shall surely drink.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	29	For, lo, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name; and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished; for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith Jehovah of hosts.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	30	Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, Jehovah will roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he will mightily roar against his fold; he will give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	31	A noise shall come even to the end of the earth; for Jehovah hath a controversy with the nations; he will enter into judgment with all flesh: as for the wicked, he will give them to the sword, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	32	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great tempest shall be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	33	And the slain of Jehovah shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the face of the ground.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	34	Wail, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow in ashes, ye principal of the flock; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are fully come, and ye shall fall like a goodly vessel.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	35	And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	36	A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and the wailing of the principal of the flock! for Jehovah layeth waste their pasture.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	37	And the peaceable folds are brought to silence because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	25	38	He hath left his covert, as the lion; for their land is become an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppressing sword, and because of his fierce anger.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	1	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word from Jehovah, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	2	Thus saith Jehovah: Stand in the court of Jehovahs house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in Jehovahs house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	3	It may be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way; that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	4	And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah: If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	5	to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I send unto you, even rising up early and sending them, but ye have not hearkened;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	6	then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	7	And the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	8	And it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that Jehovah had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold on him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	9	Why hast thou prophesied in the name of Jehovah, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant? And all the people were gathered unto Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	10	And when the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the kings house unto the house of Jehovah; and they sat in the entry of the new gate of Jehovahs house.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	11	Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy of death; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	12	Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, Jehovah sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	13	Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of Jehovah your God; and Jehovah will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	14	But as for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as is good and right in your eyes.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	15	Only know ye for certain that, if ye put me to death, ye will bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof; for of a truth Jehovah hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	16	Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets: This man is not worthy of death; for he hath spoken to us in the name of Jehovah our God.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	17	Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	18	Micah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the hi	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	19	Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? did he not fear Jehovah, and entreat the favor of Jehovah, and Jehovah repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus should we commit great evil against our own souls.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	20	And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of Jehovah, Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath-jearim; and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	21	and when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty-men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	22	and Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him, into Egypt;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	23	and they fetched forth Uriah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king, who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	26	24	But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	27	1	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	27	2	Thus saith Jehovah to me: Make thee bonds and bars, and put them upon thy neck;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	27	3	and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers that come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	27	4	and give them a charge unto their masters, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Thus shall ye say unto your masters:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	27	5	I have made the earth, the men and the beasts that are upon the face of the earth, by my great power and by my outstretched arm; and I give it unto whom it seemeth right unto me.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	27	6	And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field also have I given him to serve him.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	27	7	And all the nations shall serve him, and his son, and his sons son, until the time of his own land come: and then many nations and great kings shall make him their bondman.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	27	8	And it shall come to pass, that the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith Jehovah, with the sword, and	24
ASV	Jeremiah	27	9	But as for you, hearken ye not to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreams, nor to your soothsayers, nor to your sorcerers, that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	27	10	for they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land, and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	27	11	But the nation that shall bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, that nation will I let remain in their own land, saith Jehovah; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	27	12	And I spake to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	27	13	Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as Jehovah hath spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	27	14	And hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon; for they prophesy a lie unto you.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	27	15	For I have not sent them, saith Jehovah, but they prophesy falsely in my name; that I may drive you out, and that ye may perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	27	16	Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of Jehovahs house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon; for they proph	24
ASV	Jeremiah	27	17	Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city become a desolation?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	27	18	But if they be prophets, and if the word of Jehovah be with them, let them now make intercession to Jehovah of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of Jehovah, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	27	19	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that are left in this city,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	27	20	which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	27	21	yea, thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of Jehovah, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	27	22	They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be, until the day that I visit them, saith Jehovah; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	28	1	And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of Jehovah, in the presence of t	24
ASV	Jeremiah	28	2	Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	28	3	Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Jehovahs house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried to Babylon:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	28	4	and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went to Babylon, saith Jehovah; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	28	5	Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of Jehovah,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	28	6	even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: Jehovah do so; Jehovah perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of Jehovahs house, and all them of the captivity, from Babylon unto this place.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	28	7	Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	28	8	The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	28	9	The prophet that prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that Jehovah hath truly sent him.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	28	10	Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiahs neck, and brake it.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	28	11	And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon within two full years from off the neck of all the nations. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	28	12	Then the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	28	13	Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Thou hast broken the bars of wood; but thou hast made in their stead bars of iron.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	28	14	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may served Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	28	15	Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah: Jehovah hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	28	16	Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will send thee away from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast spoken rebellion against Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	28	17	So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	1	Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusale	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	2	(after that Jeconiah the king, and the queen-mother, and the eunuchs, and the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem,)	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	3	by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,) saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	4	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all the captivity, whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem unto Babylon:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	5	Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	6	Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; and multiply ye there, and be not diminished.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	7	And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray unto Jehovah for it; for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	8	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Let not your prophets that are in the midst of you, and your diviners, deceive you; neither hearken ye to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	9	For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	10	For thus saith Jehovah, After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon, I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	11	For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith Jehovah, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you hope in your latter end.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	12	And ye shall call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	13	And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	14	And I will be found of you, saith Jehovah, and I will turn again your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places wither I have driven you, saith Jehovah; and I will bring you again unto the place whence I caused you to	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	15	Because ye have said, Jehovah hath raised us up prophets in Babylon;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	16	thus saith Jehovah concerning the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and concerning all the people that dwell in this city, your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	17	thus saith Jehovah of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	18	And I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an execration, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach, among all th	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	19	because they have not hearkened to my words, saith Jehovah, wherewith I sent unto them my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	20	Hear ye therefore the word of Jehovah, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	21	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie unto you in my name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he sh	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	22	and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captives of Judah that are in Babylon, saying, Jehovah make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	23	because they have wrought folly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors wives, and have spoken words in my name falsely, which I commanded them not; and I am he that knoweth, and am witness, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	24	And concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite thou shalt speak, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	25	Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thine own name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	26	Jehovah hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that there may be officers in the house of Jehovah, for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in the stocks and in shackles.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	27	Now therefore, why hast thou not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who maketh himself a prophet to you,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	28	forasmuch as he hath sent unto us in Babylon, saying, The captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	29	And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	30	Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	31	Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith Jehovah concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he hath caused you to trust in a lie;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	29	32	therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed; he shall not have a man to dwell among this people, neither shall he behold the good that I will do unto my people, saith Jehovah, because he hath spoken rebellion	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	1	The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	2	Thus speaketh Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	3	For, lo, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will turn again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith Jehovah; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	4	And these are the words that Jehovah spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	5	For thus saith Jehovah: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	6	Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child: wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	7	Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacobs trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	8	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds; and strangers shall no more make him their bondman;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	9	but they shall serve Jehovah their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	10	Therefore fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith Jehovah; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	11	For I am with thee, saith Jehovah, to save thee: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have scattered thee, but I will not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee in measure, and will in no wise leave thee unpunished.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	12	For thus saith Jehovah, Thy hurt is incurable, and thy wound grievous.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	13	There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	14	All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not: for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	15	Why criest thou for thy hurt? thy pain is incurable: for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	16	Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that despoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	17	For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith Jehovah; because they have called thee an outcast, saying, It is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	18	Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Jacobs tents, and have compassion on his dwelling-places; and the city shall be builded upon its own hill, and the palace shall be inhabited after its own manner.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	19	And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	20	Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me; and I will punish all that oppress them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	21	And their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is he that hath had boldness to approach unto me? saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	22	And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	23	Behold, the tempest of Jehovah, even his wrath, is gone forth, a sweeping tempest: it shall burst upon the head of the wicked.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	30	24	The fierce anger of Jehovah shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall understand it.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	1	At that time, saith Jehovah, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	2	Thus saith Jehovah, The people that were left of the sword found favor in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	3	Jehovah appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	4	Again will I build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: again shalt thou be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	5	Again shalt thou plant vineyards upon the mountains of Samaria; the planters shall plant, and shall enjoy the fruit thereof.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	6	For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the hills of Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto Jehovah our God.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	7	For thus saith Jehovah, Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout for the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O Jehovah, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	8	Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall they return hither.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	9	They shall come with weeping; and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters, in a straight way wherein they shall not stumble; for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my first-born.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	10	Hear the word of Jehovah, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off; and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as shepherd doth his flock.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	11	For Jehovah hath ransomed Jacob, and redeemed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	12	And they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow unto the goodness of Jehovah, to the grain, and to the new wine, and to the oil, and to the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	13	Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together; for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	14	And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	15	Thus saith Jehovah: A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her children; she refuseth to be comforted for her children, because they are not.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	16	Thus saith Jehovah: Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears; for thy work shall be rewarded, saith Jehovah; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	17	And there is hope for thy latter end, saith Jehovah; and thy children shall come again to their own border.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	18	I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus, Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a calf unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art Jehovah my God.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	19	Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	20	Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a darling child? for as often as I speak against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my heart yearneth for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	21	Set thee up waymarks, make thee guide-posts; set thy heart toward the highway, even the way by which thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	22	How long wilt thou go hither and thither, O thou backsliding daughter? for Jehovah hath created a new thing in the earth: a woman shall encompass a man.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	23	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Yet again shall they use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity: Jehovah bless thee, O habitation of righteousness, O mountain of holiness.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	24	And Judah and all the cities thereof shall dwell therein together, the husbandmen, and they that go about with flocks.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	25	For I have satiated the weary soul, and every sorrowful soul have I replenished.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	26	Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	27	Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	28	And it shall come to pass that, like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict, so will I watch over them to build and to plant, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	29	In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the childrens teeth are set on edge.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	30	But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	31	Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	32	not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was a husband unto them, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	33	But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith Jehovah: I will put my law in their inward parts, and in their heart will I write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	34	and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith Jehovah: for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin will I reme	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	35	Thus saith Jehovah, who giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirreth up the sea, so that the waves thereof roar; Jehovah of hosts is his name:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	36	If these ordinances depart from before me, saith Jehovah, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	37	Thus saith Jehovah: If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, then will I also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	38	Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that the city shall be built to Jehovah from the tower of Hananel unto the gate of the corner.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	39	And the measuring line shall go out further straight onward unto the hill Gareb, and shall turn about unto Goah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	31	40	And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto Jehovah; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	1	The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	2	Now at that time the king of Babylons army was besieging Jerusalem; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judahs house.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	3	For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	4	and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	5	and he shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith Jehovah: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	6	And Jeremiah said, The word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	7	Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is thine to buy it.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	8	So Hanamel mine uncles son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of Jehovah, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	9	And I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel mine uncles son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	10	And I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	11	So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, according to the law and custom, and that which was open:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	12	and I delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel mine uncles son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the cou	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	13	And I charged Baruch before them, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	14	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	15	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	16	Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto Jehovah, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	17	Ah Lord Jehovah! behold, thou hast made the heavens and the earth by thy great power and by thine outstretched arm; there is nothing too hard for thee,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	18	who showest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them; the great, the mighty God, Jehovah of hosts is his name;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	19	great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men, to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	20	who didst set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, both in Israel and among other men; and madest thee a name, as at this day;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	21	and didst bring forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	22	and gavest them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	23	and they came in, and possessed it, but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	24	Behold, the mounds, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence; and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	25	And thou hast said unto me, O Lord Jehovah, Buy thee the field for money, and call witnesses; whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	26	Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	27	Behold, I am Jehovah, the God of all flesh: is there anything too hard for me?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	28	Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	29	and the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink-offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	30	For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	31	For this city hath been to me a provocation of mine anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	32	because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	33	And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: and though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	34	But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	35	And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abominat	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	36	And now therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	37	Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	38	and they shall be my people, and I will be their God:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	39	and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	40	and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good; and I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	41	Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	42	For thus saith Jehovah: Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	43	And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	32	44	Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill-country, and in the cities of the lowland, an	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	1	Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	2	Thus saith Jehovah that doeth it, Jehovah that formeth it to establish it; Jehovah is his name:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	3	Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and will show thee great things, and difficult, which thou knowest not.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	4	For thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down to make a defence against the mounds and against the sword;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	5	while men come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my wrath, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	6	Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them; and I will reveal unto them abundance of peace and truth.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	7	And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	8	And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned against me, and whereby they have transgressed against me.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	9	And this city shall be to me for a name of joy, for a praise and for a glory, before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them, and shall fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I procure unto it.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	10	Thus saith Jehovah: Yet again there shall be heard in this place, whereof ye say, It is waste, without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without b	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	11	the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that say, Give thanks to Jehovah of hosts, for Jehovah is good, for his lovingkindness endureth for ever; and of them that bring sacrific	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	12	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Yet again shall there be in this place, which is waste, without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	13	In the cities of the hill-country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him that numbereth	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	14	Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	15	In those days, and at that time, will I cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	16	In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely; and this is the name whereby she shall be called: Jehovah our righteousness.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	17	For thus saith Jehovah: David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	18	neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt-offerings, and to burn meal-offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	19	And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	20	Thus saith Jehovah: If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, so that there shall not be day and night in their season;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	21	then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he shall not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	22	As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured; so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	23	And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	24	Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which Jehovah did choose, he hath cast them off? thus do they despise my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	25	Thus saith Jehovah: If my covenant of day and night stand not, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	33	26	then will I also cast away the seed of Jacob, and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and will have mercy on them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	34	1	The word which came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion, and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof	24
ASV	Jeremiah	34	2	Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Go, and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	34	3	and thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	34	4	Yet hear the word of Jehovah, O Zedekiah king of Judah: thus saith Jehovah concerning thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	34	5	thou shalt die in peace; and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings that were before thee, so shall they make a burning for thee; and they shall lament thee, saying, Ah Lord! for I have spoken the word, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	34	6	Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	34	7	when the king of Babylons army was fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah; for these alone remained of the cities of Judah as fortified cities.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	34	8	The word that came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people that were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	34	9	that every man should let his man-servant, and every man his maid-servant, that is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free; that none should make bondmen of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	34	10	And all the princes and all the people obeyed, that had entered into the covenant, that every one should let his man-servant, and every one his maid-servant, go free, that none should make bondmen of them any more; they obeyed, and let them go:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	34	11	but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	34	12	Therefore the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	34	13	Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	34	14	At the end of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother that is a Hebrew, that hath been sold unto thee, and hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	34	15	And ye were now turned, and had done that which is right in mine eyes, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	34	16	but ye turned and profaned my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had let go free at their pleasure, to return; and ye brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	34	17	Therefore thus saith Jehovah: ye have not hearkened unto me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbor: behold, I proclaim unto you a liberty, saith Jehovah, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will	24
ASV	Jeremiah	34	18	And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, that have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me, when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereof;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	34	19	the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, that passed between the parts of the calf;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	34	20	I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life; and their dead bodies shall be for food unto the birds of the heavens, and to the beasts of the earth.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	34	21	And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylons army, that are gone away from you.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	34	22	Behold, I will command, saith Jehovah, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	35	1	The word which came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	35	2	Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of Jehovah, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	35	3	Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	35	4	and I brought them into the house of Jehovah, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the threshold.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	35	5	And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	35	6	But they said, We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons, for ever:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	35	7	neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any; but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land wherein ye sojourn.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	35	8	And we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	35	9	nor to build houses for us to dwell in; neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	35	10	but we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	35	11	But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians; so we dwell at Jerusalem.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	35	12	Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	35	13	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Go, and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	35	14	The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed; and unto this day they drink none, for they obey their fathers commandment: but I have spoken unto you, rising up early and speaking; and ye have not hea	24
ASV	Jeremiah	35	15	I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have give	24
ASV	Jeremiah	35	16	Forasmuch as the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people hath not hearkened unto me;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	35	17	therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I	24
ASV	Jeremiah	35	18	And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he commanded you;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	35	19	therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	1	And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	2	Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	3	It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	4	Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Jehovah, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	5	And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of Jehovah:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	6	therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of Jehovah in the ears of the people in Jehovahs house upon the fast-day; and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	7	It may be they will present their supplication before Jehovah, and will return every one from his evil way; for great is the anger and the wrath that Jehovah hath pronounced against this people.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	8	And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of Jehovah in Jehovahs house.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	9	Now it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, that all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	10	Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan, the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of Jehovahs house, in the ears of all the people.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	11	And when Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of Jehovah,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	12	he went down into the kings house, into the scribes chamber: and, lo, all the princes were sitting there, to wit, Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son o	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	13	Then Micaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	14	Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thy hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	15	And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	16	Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	17	And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	18	Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	19	Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye are.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	20	And they went in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they told all the words in the ears of the king.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	21	So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll; and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes that stood beside the king.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	22	Now the king was sitting in the winter-house in the ninth month: and there was a fire in the brazier burning before him.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	23	And it came to pass, when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, that the king cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	24	And they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	25	Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll; but he would not hear them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	26	And the king commanded Jerahmeel the kings son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Jehovah hid them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	27	Then the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	28	Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	29	And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah thou shalt say, Thus saith Jehovah: Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	30	Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	31	And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they hearkened not.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	36	32	Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and there were added besides unto them many	24
ASV	Jeremiah	37	1	And Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	37	2	But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of Jehovah, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	37	3	And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto Jehovah our God for us.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	37	4	Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people; for they had not put him into prison.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	37	5	And Pharaohs army was come forth out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans that were besieging Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they brake up from Jerusalem.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	37	6	Then came the word of Jehovah unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	37	7	Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to inquire of me: Behold, Pharaohs army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	37	8	And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city; and they shall take it, and burn it with fire.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	37	9	Thus saith Jehovah, Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us; for they shall not depart.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	37	10	For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yea would they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	37	11	And it came to pass that, when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaohs army,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	37	12	then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the midst of the people.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	37	13	And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he laid hold on Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou art falling away to the Chaldeans.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	37	14	Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I am not falling away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him; so Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	37	15	And the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	37	16	When Jeremiah was come into the dungeon-house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	37	17	Then Zedekiah the king sent, and fetched him: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from Jehovah? And Jeremiah said, There is. He said also, Thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	37	18	Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, Wherein have I sinned against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	37	19	Where now are your prophets that prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	37	20	And now hear, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be presented before thee, that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	37	21	Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard; and they gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers street, until all the bread in the city was spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	1	And Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah, heard the words that Jeremiah spake unto all the people, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	2	Thus saith Jehovah, He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey, and he shall live.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	3	Thus saith Jehovah, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	4	Then the princes said unto the king, Let this man, we pray thee, be put to death; forasmuch as he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not t	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	5	And Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand; for the king is not he that can do anything against you.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	6	Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchijah the kings son, that was in the court of the guard: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	7	Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the kings house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin,)	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	8	Ebed-melech went forth out of the kings house, and spake to the king, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	9	My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	10	Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	11	So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	12	And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these rags and worn-out garments under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	13	So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	14	Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of Jehovah: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	15	Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken unto me.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	16	So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As Jehovah liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	17	Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If thou wilt go forth unto the king of Babylons princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thy house.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	18	But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylons princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	19	And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	20	But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of Jehovah, in that which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well with thee, and thy soul shall live.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	21	But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that Jehovah hath showed me:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	22	behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judahs house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylons princes, and those women shall say, Thy familiar friends have set thee on, and have prevailed over thee: now that thy feet are sunk in the mire,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	23	And they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans; and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	24	Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	25	But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king; hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	26	then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathans house, to die there.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	27	Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	38	28	So Jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	39	1	And it came to pass when Jerusalem was taken, (in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and besieged it;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	39	2	in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city,)	24
ASV	Jeremiah	39	3	that all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, to wit, Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, with all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	39	4	And it came to pass that, when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the kings garden, through the gate betwixt the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	39	5	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment upon him.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	39	6	Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	39	7	Moreover he put out Zedekiahs eyes, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	39	8	And the Chaldeans burned the kings house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	39	9	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people that remained in the city, the deserters also that fell away to him, and the residue of the people that remained.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	39	10	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, that had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	39	11	Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	39	12	Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	39	13	So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushazban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	39	14	they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	39	15	Now the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	39	16	Go, and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished before thee in that day.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	39	17	But I will deliver thee in that day, saith Jehovah; and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	39	18	For I will surely save thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee; because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	40	1	The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, that were carried away captive unto Babylon	24
ASV	Jeremiah	40	2	And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, Jehovah thy God pronounced this evil upon this place;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	40	3	and Jehovah hath brought it, and done according as he spake: because ye have sinned against Jehovah, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	40	4	And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which are upon thy hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will look well unto thee; but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all t	24
ASV	Jeremiah	40	5	Now while he was not yet gone back, Go back then, said he, to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wheresoever it seemeth right unt	24
ASV	Jeremiah	40	6	Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	40	7	Now when all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poorest	24
ASV	Jeremiah	40	8	then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, to wit, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	40	9	And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	40	10	As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans that shall come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	40	11	Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son o	24
ASV	Jeremiah	40	12	then all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	40	13	Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	40	14	and said unto him, Dost thou know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take thy life? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	40	15	Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he take thy life, that all the Jews that are gathered unto thee s	24
ASV	Jeremiah	40	16	But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing; for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	41	1	Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal and one of the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bre	24
ASV	Jeremiah	41	2	Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	41	3	Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, to wit, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, the men of war.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	41	4	And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	41	5	that there came men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with meal-offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to the house of Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	41	6	And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	41	7	And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	41	8	But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	41	9	Now the pit wherein Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain, by the side of Gedaliah (the same was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel,) Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	41	10	Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the kings daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; Ishmael the s	24
ASV	Jeremiah	41	11	But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	41	12	then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	41	13	Now it came to pass that, when all the people that were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	41	14	So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	41	15	But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	41	16	Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, to wit, the	24
ASV	Jeremiah	41	17	and they departed, and dwelt in Geruth Chimham, which is by Beth-lehem, to go to enter into Egypt,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	41	18	because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	42	1	Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	42	2	and said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we pray thee, our supplication be presented before thee, and pray for us unto Jehovah thy God, even for all this remnant; for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	42	3	that Jehovah thy God may show us the way wherein we should walk, and the thing that we should do.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	42	4	Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto Jehovah your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass that whatsoever thing Jehovah shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back f	24
ASV	Jeremiah	42	5	Then they said to Jeremiah, Jehovah be a true and faithful witness amongst us, if we do not according to all the word wherewith Jehovah thy God shall send thee to us.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	42	6	Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of Jehovah our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of Jehovah our God.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	42	7	And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	42	8	Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	42	9	and said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	42	10	If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	42	11	Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith Jehovah: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	42	12	And I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	42	13	But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land; so that ye obey not the voice of Jehovah your God,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	42	14	saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	42	15	now therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah, O remnant of Judah: Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, If ye indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	42	16	then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye fear, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, whereof ye are afraid, shall follow hard after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	42	17	So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there: they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	42	18	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: As mine anger and my wrath hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt; and ye shall be an execration, and an asto	24
ASV	Jeremiah	42	19	Jehovah hath spoken concerning you, O remnant of Judah, Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have testified unto you this day.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	42	20	For ye have dealt deceitfully against your own souls; for ye sent me unto Jehovah your God, saying, Pray for us unto Jehovah our God; and according unto all that Jehovah our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	42	21	and I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah your God in anything for which he hath sent me unto you.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	42	22	Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go to sojourn there.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	43	1	And it came to pass that, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of Jehovah their God, wherewith Jehovah their God had sent him to them, even all these words,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	43	2	then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: Jehovah our God hath not sent thee to say, Ye shall not go into Egypt to sojourn there;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	43	3	but Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captive to Babylon.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	43	4	So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of Jehovah, to dwell in the land of Judah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	43	5	But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all the nations whither they had been driven, to sojourn in the land of Judah;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	43	6	the men, and the women, and the children, and the kings daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	43	7	and they came into the land of Egypt; for they obeyed not the voice of Jehovah: and they came unto Tahpanhes.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	43	8	Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	43	9	Take great stones in thy hand, and hide them in mortar in the brickwork, which is at the entry of Pharaohs house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	43	10	and say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	43	11	And he shall come, and shall smite the land of Egypt; such as are for death shall be given to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	43	12	And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captive: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	43	13	He shall also break the pillars of Beth-shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of Egypt shall he burn with fire.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	1	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews that dwelt in the land of Egypt, that dwelt at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Memphis, and in the country of Pathros, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	2	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	3	because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, that they knew not, neither they, nor ye, nor your fathers.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	4	Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	5	But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	6	Wherefore my wrath and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as it is this day.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	7	Therefore now thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your own souls, to cut off from you man and woman, infant and suckling, out of the midst of Judah, to leave you none remaining;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	8	in that ye provoke me unto anger with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye are gone to sojourn; that ye may be cut off, and that ye may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	9	Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives which they committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerus	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	10	They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	11	Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, even to cut off all Judah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	12	And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed; in the land of Egypt shall they fall; they shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine; they shall die, fro	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	13	For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	14	so that none of the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or be left, to return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return save such as shall escape.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	15	Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great assembly, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	16	As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of Jehovah, we will not hearken unto thee.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	17	But we will certainly perform every word that is gone forth out of our mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and i	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	18	But since we left off burning incense to the queen of heaven, and pouring out drink-offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	19	And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink-offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink-offerings unto her, without our husbands?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	20	Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, even to all the people that had given him that answer, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	21	The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not Jehovah remember them, and came it not into his mind?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	22	so that Jehovah could not longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is this day.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	23	Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against Jehovah, and have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as it is this day.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	24	Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of Jehovah, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	25	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and with your hands have fulfilled it, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	26	Therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith Jehovah, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, As the Lord Jeho	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	27	Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	28	And they that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose word shall stand, mine, or theirs.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	29	And this shall be the sign unto you, saith Jehovah, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	44	30	Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy, and sough	24
ASV	Jeremiah	45	1	The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote these word in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	45	2	Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	45	3	Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for Jehovah hath added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	45	4	Thus shalt thou say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up; and this in the whole land.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	45	5	And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not; for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith Jehovah; but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	1	The word of Jehovah which came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	2	Of Egypt: concerning the army of Pharaoh-neco king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	3	Prepare ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	4	Harness the horses, and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, put on the coats of mail.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	5	Wherefore have I seen it? they are dismayed and are turned backward; and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not back: terror is on every side, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	6	Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; in the north by the river Euphrates have they stumbled and fallen.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	7	Who is this that riseth up like the Nile, whose waters toss themselves like the rivers?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	8	Egypt riseth up like the Nile, and his waters toss themselves like the rivers: and he saith, I will rise up, I will cover the earth; I will destroy cities and the inhabitants thereof.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	9	Go up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men go forth: Cush and Put, that handle the shield; and the Ludim, that handle and bend the bow.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	10	For that day is a day of the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour and be satiate, and shall drink its fill of their blood; for the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, hath a sacrifice in the	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	11	Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt: in vain dost thou use many medicines; there is no healing for thee.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	12	The nations have heard of thy shame, and the earth is full of thy cry; for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, they are fallen both of them together.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	13	The word that Jehovah spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	14	Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Memphis and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand forth, and prepare thee; for the sword hath devoured round about thee.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	15	Why are thy strong ones swept away? they stood not, because Jehovah did drive them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	16	He made many to stumble, yea, they fell one upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	17	They cried there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he hath let the appointed time pass by.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	18	As I live, saith the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts, surely like Tabor among the mountains, and like Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	19	O thou daughter that dwellest in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity; for Memphis shall become a desolation, and shall be burnt up, without inhabitant.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	20	Egypt is a very fair heifer; but destruction out of the north is come, it is come.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	21	Also her hired men in the midst of her are like calves of the stall; for they also are turned back, they are fled away together, they did not stand: for the day of their calamity is come upon them, the time of their visitation.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	22	The sound thereof shall go like the serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	23	They shall cut down her forest, saith Jehovah, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the locusts, and are innumerable.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	24	The daughter of Egypt shall be put to shame; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	25	Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saith: Behold, I will punish Amon of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with her gods, and her kings; even Pharaoh, and them that trust in him:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	26	and I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants; and afterwards it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	27	But fear not thou, O Jacob my servant, neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	46	28	Fear not thou, O Jacob my servant, saith Jehovah; for I am with thee: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee; but I will not make a full end of thee, but I will correct thee in measure, and will in no wise leave thee unpu	24
ASV	Jeremiah	47	1	The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	47	2	Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall become an overflowing stream, and shall overflow the land and all that is therein, the city and them that dwell therein; and the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shal	24
ASV	Jeremiah	47	3	At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones, at the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers look not back to their children for feebleness of hands;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	47	4	because of the day that cometh to destroy all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper that remaineth: for Jehovah will destroy the Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Caphtor.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	47	5	Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is brought to nought, the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	47	6	O thou sword of Jehovah, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into thy scabbard; rest, and be still.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	47	7	How canst thou be quiet, seeing Jehovah hath given thee a charge? Against Ashkelon, and against the sea-shore, there hath he appointed it.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	1	Of Moab. Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Woe unto Nebo! for it is laid waste; Kiriathaim is put to shame, it is taken; Misgab is put to shame and broken down.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	2	The praise of Moab is no more; in Heshbon they have devised evil against her: Come, and let us cut her off from being a nation. Thou also, O Madmen, shalt be brought to silence: the sword shall pursue thee.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	3	The sound of a cry from Horonaim, desolation and great destruction!	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	4	Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	5	For by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping shall they go up; for at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	6	Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	7	For, because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou also shalt be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity, his priests and his princes together.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	8	And the destroyer shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape; the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed; as Jehovah hath spoken.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	9	Give wings unto Moab, that she may fly and get her away: and her cities shall become a desolation, without any to dwell therein.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	10	Cursed be he that doeth the work of Jehovah negligently; and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	11	Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remaineth in him, and his scent is not changed.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	12	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will send unto him them that pour off, and they shall pour him off; and they shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles in pieces.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	13	And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Beth-el their confidence.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	14	How say ye, We are mighty men, and valiant men for the war?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	15	Moab is laid waste, and they are gone up into his cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	16	The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	17	All ye that are round about him, bemoan him, and all ye that know his name; say, How is the strong staff broken, the beautiful rod!	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	18	O thou daughter that dwellest in Dibon, come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst; for the destroyer of Moab is come up against thee, he hath destroyed thy strongholds.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	19	O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and watch: ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth; say, What hath been done?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	20	Moab is put to shame; for it is broken down: wail and cry; tell ye it by the Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	21	And judgment is come upon the plain country, upon Holon, and upon Jahzah, and upon Mephaath,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	22	and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	23	and upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	24	and upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	25	The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	26	Make ye him drunken; for he magnified himself against Jehovah: and Moab shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	27	For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for as often as thou speakest of him, thou waggest the head.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	28	O ye inhabitants of Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock; and be like the dove that maketh her nest over the mouth of the abyss.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	29	We have heard of the pride of Moab, that he is very proud; his loftiness, and his pride, and his arrogancy, and the haughtiness of his heart.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	30	I know his wrath, saith Jehovah, that it is nought; his boastings have wrought nothing.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	31	Therefore will I wail for Moab; yea, I will cry out for all Moab: for the men of Kir-heres shall they mourn.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	32	With more than the weeping of Jazer will I weep for thee, O vine of Sibmah: thy branches passed over the sea, they reached even to the sea of Jazer: upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage the destroyer is fallen.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	33	And gladness and joy is taken away from the fruitful field and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to cease from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; the shouting shall be no shouting.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	34	From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, even unto Jahaz have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, to Eglath-shelishiyah: for the waters of Nimrim also shall become desolate.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	35	Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith Jehovah, him that offereth in the high place, and him that burneth incense to his gods.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	36	Therefore my heart soundeth for Moab like pipes, and my heart soundeth like pipes for the men of Kir-heres: therefore the abundance that he hath gotten is perished.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	37	For every head is bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands are cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	38	On all the housetops of Moab and in the streets thereof there is lamentation every where; for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein none delighteth, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	39	How is it broken down! how do they wail! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab become a derision and a terror to all that are round about him.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	40	For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread out his wings against Moab.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	41	Kerioth is taken, and the strongholds are seized, and the heart of the mighty men of Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	42	And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	43	Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	44	He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon him, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	45	They that fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon; for a fire is gone forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and hath devoured the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	46	Woe unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh is undone; for thy sons are taken away captive, and thy daughters into captivity.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	48	47	Yet will I bring back the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith Jehovah. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	1	Of the children of Ammon. Thus saith Jehovah: Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why then doth Malcam possess Gad, and his people well in the cities thereof?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	2	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon; and it shall become a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel possess them that d	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	3	Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste; cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth: lament, and run to and fro among the fences; for Malcam shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	4	Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come unto me?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	5	Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, from all that are round about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth, and there shall be none to gather together the fugitives.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	6	But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	7	Of Edom. Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	8	Flee ye, turn back, dwell in the depths, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I shall visit him.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	9	If grape-gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, would they not destroy till they had enough?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	10	But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is destroyed, and his brethren, and his neighbors; and he is not.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	11	Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	12	For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, they to whom it pertained not to drink of the cup shall assuredly drink; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	13	For I have sworn by myself, saith Jehovah, that Bozrah shall become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	14	I have heard tidings from Jehovah, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, saying, Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	15	For, behold, I have made thee small among the nations, and despised among men.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	16	As for thy terribleness, the pride of thy heart hath deceived thee, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith Je	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	17	And Edom shall become an astonishment: every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	18	As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, saith Jehovah, no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	19	Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who i	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	20	Therefore hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they shall drag them away, even the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	21	The earth trembleth at the noise of their fall; there is a cry, the noise whereof is heard in the Red Sea.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	22	Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread out his wings against Bozrah: and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	23	Of Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad; for they have heard evil tidings, they are melted away: there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	24	Damascus is waxed feeble, she turneth herself to flee, and trembling hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	25	How is the city of praise not forsaken, the city of my joy?	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	26	Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	27	And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	28	Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote. Thus saith Jehovah: Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and destroy the children of the east.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	29	Their tents and their flocks shall they take; they shall carry away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Terror on every side!	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	30	Flee ye, wander far off, dwell in the depths, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith Jehovah; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	31	Arise, get you up unto a nation that is at ease, that dwelleth without care, saith Jehovah; that have neither gates nor bars, that dwell alone.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	32	And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter unto all winds them that have the corners of their hair cut off; and I will bring their calamity from every side of them, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	33	And Hazor shall be a dwelling-place of jackals, a desolation for ever: no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	34	The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	35	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	36	And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	37	And I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life; and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith Jehovah; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	38	and I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence king and princes, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	49	39	But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring back the captivity of Elam, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	1	The word that Jehovah spake concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by Jeremiah the prophet.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	2	Declare ye among the nations and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is put to shame, Merodach is dismayed; her images are put to shame, her idols are dismayed.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	3	For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they are fled, they are gone, both man and beast.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	4	In those days, and in that time, saith Jehovah, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together; they shall go on their way weeping, and shall seek Jehovah their God.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	5	They shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come ye, and join yourselves to Jehovah in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	6	My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray; they have turned them away on the mountains; they have gone from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their resting-place.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	7	All that found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said, We are not guilty, because they have sinned against Jehovah, the habitation of righteousness, even Jehovah, the hope of their fathers.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	8	Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he-goats before the flocks.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	9	For, lo, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon a company of great nations from the north country; and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of an expert mighty man; none shal	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	10	And Chaldea shall be a prey: all that prey upon her shall be satisfied, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	11	Because ye are glad, because ye rejoice, O ye that plunder my heritage, because ye are wanton as a heifer that treadeth out the grain, and neigh as strong horses;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	12	your mother shall be utterly put to shame; she that bare you shall be confounded: behold, she shall be the hindermost of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	13	Because of the wrath of Jehovah she shall not be inhabited, but she shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	14	Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, all ye that bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	15	Shout against her round about: she hath submitted herself; her bulwarks are fallen, her walls are thrown down; for it is the vengeance of Jehovah: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	16	Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	17	Israel is a hunted sheep; the lions have driven him away: first, the king of Assyria devoured him; and now at last Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	18	Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	19	And I will bring Israel again to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	20	In those days, and in that time, saith Jehovah, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	21	Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: slay and utterly destroy after them, saith Jehovah, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	22	A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	23	How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	24	I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	25	Jehovah hath opened his armory, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation; for the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, hath a work to do in the land of the Chaldeans.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	26	Come against her from the utmost border; open her store-houses; cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly; let nothing of her be left.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	27	Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	28	The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of Jehovah our God, the vengeance of his temple.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	29	Call together the archers against Babylon, all them that bend the bow; encamp against her round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her; for she hath been proud against Jehovah	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	30	Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets, and all her men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	31	Behold, I am against thee, O thou proud one, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts; for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	32	And the proud one shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up; and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all that are round about him.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	33	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together; and all that took them captive hold them fast; they refuse to let them go.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	34	Their Redeemer is strong; Jehovah of hosts is his name: he will thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	35	A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith Jehovah, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	36	A sword is upon the boasters, and they shall become fools; a sword is upon her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	37	A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures, and they shall be robbed.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	38	A drought is upon her waters, and they shall be dried up; for it is a land of graven images, and they are mad over idols.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	39	Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there, and the ostriches shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	40	As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, saith Jehovah, so shall no man dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	41	Behold, a people cometh from the north; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	42	They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, every one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	43	The king of Babylon hath heard the tidings of them, and his hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	44	Behold, the enemy shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? an	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	45	Therefore hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely they shall drag them away, even the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habita	24
ASV	Jeremiah	50	46	At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembleth, and the cry is heard among the nations.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	1	Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in Leb-kamai, a destroying wind.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	2	And I will send unto Babylon strangers, that shall winnow her; and they shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	3	Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against him that lifteth himself up in his coat of mail: and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	4	And they shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans, and thrust through in her streets.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	5	For Israel is not forsaken, nor Judah, of his God, of Jehovah of hosts; though their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	6	Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and save every man his life; be not cut off in her iniquity: for it is the time of Jehovahs vengeance; he will render unto her a recompense.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	7	Babylon hath been a golden cup in Jehovahs hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunk of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	8	Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: wail for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	9	We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country; for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	10	Jehovah hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of Jehovah our God.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	11	Make sharp the arrows; hold firm the shields: Jehovah hath stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes; because his purpose is against Babylon, to destroy it: for it is the vengeance of Jehovah, the vengeance of his temple.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	12	Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set the watchmen, prepare the ambushes; for Jehovah hath both purposed and done that which he spake concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	13	O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, the measure of thy covetousness.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	14	Jehovah of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill thee with men, as with the canker-worm; and they shall lift up a shout against thee.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	15	He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	16	when he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	17	Every man is become brutish and is without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	18	They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	19	The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: Jehovah of hosts is his name.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	20	Thou art my battle-axe and weapons of war: and with thee will I break in pieces the nations; and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	21	and with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	22	and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and him that rideth therein; and with thee will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces the old man and the youth; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the vi	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	23	and with thee will I break in pieces the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces governors and deputies.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	24	And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	25	Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith Jehovah, which destroyest all the earth; and I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	26	And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	27	Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz: appoint a marshal against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough canker-wo	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	28	Prepare against her the nations, the kings of the Medes, the governors thereof, and all the deputies thereof, and all the land of their dominion.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	29	And the land trembleth and is in pain; for the purposes of Jehovah against Babylon do stand, to make the land of Babylon a desolation, without inhabitant.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	30	The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight, they remain in their strongholds; their might hath failed; they are become as women: her dwelling-places are set on fire; her bars are broken.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	31	One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to met another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken on every quarter:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	32	and the passages are seized, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	33	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing-floor at the time when it is trodden; yet a little while, and the time of harvest shall come for her.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	34	Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath, like a monster, swallowed me up, he hath filled his maw with my delicacies; he hath cast me out.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	35	The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and, My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	36	Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her fountain dry.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	37	And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling-place for jackals, an astonishment, and a hissing, without inhabitant.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	38	They shall roar together like young lions; they shall growl as lions whelps.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	39	When they are heated, I will make their feast, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	40	I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he-goats.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	41	How is Sheshach taken! and the praise of the whole earth seized! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	42	The sea is come up upon Babylon; she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	43	Her cities are become a desolation, a dry land, and a desert, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	44	And I will execute judgment upon Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up; and the nations shall not flow any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	45	My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and save yourselves every man from the fierce anger of Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	46	And let not your heart faint, neither fear ye for the tidings that shall be heard in the land; for tidings shall come one year, and after that in another year shall come tidings, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	47	Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will execute judgment upon the graven images of Babylon; and her whole land shall be confounded; and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	48	Then the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for joy over Babylon; for the destroyers shall come unto her from the north, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	49	As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the land.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	50	Ye that have escaped the sword, go ye, stand not still; remember Jehovah from afar, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	51	We are confounded, because we have heard reproach; confusion hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of Jehovahs house.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	52	Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will execute judgment upon her graven images; and through all her land the wounded shall groan.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	53	Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall destroyers come unto her, saith Jehovah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	54	The sound of a cry from Babylon, and of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	55	For Jehovah layeth Babylon waste, and destroyeth out of her the great voice; and their waves roar like many waters; the noise of their voice is uttered:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	56	for the destroyer is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, their bows are broken in pieces; for Jehovah is a God of recompenses, he will surely requite.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	57	And I will make drunk her princes and her wise men, her governors and her deputies, and her mighty men; and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	58	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly overthrown, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the peoples shall labor for vanity, and the nations for the fire; and they shall be weary.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	59	The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was chief chamberlain.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	60	And Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning Babylon.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	61	And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, then see that thou read all these words,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	62	and say, O Jehovah, thou hast spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that none shall dwell therein, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	63	And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	51	64	and thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise again because of the evil that I will bring upon her; and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	1	Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	3	For through the anger of Jehovah did it come to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	4	And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	5	So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	6	In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	7	Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the kings garden; (now the Chaldeans were against the city round about;) and they went towa	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	8	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	9	Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment upon him.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	10	And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	11	And he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	12	Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	13	and he burned the house of Jehovah, and the kings house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burned he with fire.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	14	And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	15	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people, and the residue of the people that were left in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	16	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	17	And the pillars of brass that were in the house of Jehovah, and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of Jehovah, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	18	The pots also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	19	And the cups, and the firepans, and the basins, and the pots, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the bowls-that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver,- the captain of the guard took away.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	20	The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah-the brass of all these vessels was without weight.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	21	And as for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a line of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	22	And a capital of brass was upon it; and the height of the one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of brass: and the second pillar also had like unto these, and pomegranates.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	23	And there were ninety and six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were a hundred upon the network round about.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	24	And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	25	and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war; and seven men of them that saw the kings face, that were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	26	And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	27	And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	28	This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	29	in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons;	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	30	in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	31	And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of J	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	32	and he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	33	and changed his prison garments. And Jehoiachin did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life:	24
ASV	Jeremiah	52	34	and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.	24
ASV	Lamentations	1	1	How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! She is become as a widow, that was great among the nations! She that was a princess among the provinces is become tributary!	25
ASV	Lamentations	1	2	She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; Among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; they are become her enemies.	25
ASV	Lamentations	1	3	Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude; She dwelleth among the nations, she findeth no rest: All her persecutors overtook her within the straits.	25
ASV	Lamentations	1	4	The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn assembly; All her gates are desolate, her priests do sigh: Her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness.	25
ASV	Lamentations	1	5	Her adversaries are become the head, her enemies prosper; For Jehovah hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: Her young children are gone into captivity before the adversary.	25
ASV	Lamentations	1	6	And from the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed: Her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, And they are gone without strength before the pursuer.	25
ASV	Lamentations	1	7	Jerusalem remembereth in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that were from the days of old: When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and none did help her, The adversaries saw her, they did mock at her desol	25
ASV	Lamentations	1	8	Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is become as an unclean thing; All that honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: Yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.	25
ASV	Lamentations	1	9	Her filthiness was in her skirts; she remembered not her latter end; Therefore is she come down wonderfully; she hath no comforter: Behold, O Jehovah, my affliction; for the enemy hath magnified himself.	25
ASV	Lamentations	1	10	The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: For she hath seen that the nations are entered into her sanctuary, Concerning whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thine assembly.	25
ASV	Lamentations	1	11	All her people sigh, they seek bread; They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh the soul: See, O Jehovah, and behold; for I am become abject.	25
ASV	Lamentations	1	12	Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is brought upon me, Wherewith Jehovah hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.	25
ASV	Lamentations	1	13	From on high hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them; He hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: He hath made me desolate and faint all the day.	25
ASV	Lamentations	1	14	The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand; They are knit together, they are come up upon my neck; he hath made my strength to fail: The Lord hath delivered me into their hands, against whom I am not able to stand.	25
ASV	Lamentations	1	15	The Lord hath set at nought all my mighty men in the midst of me; He hath called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men: The Lord hath trodden as in a winepress the virgin daughter of Judah.	25
ASV	Lamentations	1	16	For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water; Because the comforter that should refresh my soul is far from me: My children are desolate, because the enemy hath prevailed.	25
ASV	Lamentations	1	17	Zion spreadeth forth her hands; there is none to comfort her; Jehovah hath commanded concerning Jacob, that they that are round about him should be his adversaries: Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing.	25
ASV	Lamentations	1	18	Jehovah is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: Hear, I pray you, all ye peoples, and behold my sorrow: My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.	25
ASV	Lamentations	1	19	I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: My priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, While they sought them food to refresh their souls.	25
ASV	Lamentations	1	20	Behold, O Jehovah; for I am in distress; my heart is troubled; My heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: Abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.	25
ASV	Lamentations	1	21	They have heard that I sigh; there is none to comfort me; All mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: Thou wilt bring the day that thou hast proclaimed, and they shall be like unto me.	25
ASV	Lamentations	1	22	Let all their wickedness come before thee; And do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: For my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.	25
ASV	Lamentations	2	1	How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger! He hath cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, And hath not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.	25
ASV	Lamentations	2	2	The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: He hath thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah; He hath brought them down to the ground; he hath profaned the kingdom and the princes thereof.	25
ASV	Lamentations	2	3	He hath cut off in fierce anger all the horn of Israel; He hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy: And he hath burned up Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about.	25
ASV	Lamentations	2	4	He hath bent his bow like an enemy, he hath stood with his right hand as an adversary, And hath slain all that were pleasant to the eye: In the tent of the daughter of Zion he hath poured out his wrath like fire.	25
ASV	Lamentations	2	5	The Lord is become as an enemy, he hath swallowed up Israel; He hath swallowed up all her palaces, he hath destroyed his strongholds; And he hath multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.	25
ASV	Lamentations	2	6	And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden; he hath destroyed his place of assembly: Jehovah hath caused solemn assembly and sabbath to be forgotten in Zion, And hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and th	25
ASV	Lamentations	2	7	The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary; He hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces: They have made a noise in the house of Jehovah, as in the day of a solemn assembly.	25
ASV	Lamentations	2	8	Jehovah hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion; He hath stretched out the line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying; And he hath made the rampart and wall to lament; they languish together.	25
ASV	Lamentations	2	9	Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not; Yea, her prophets find no vision from Jehovah.	25
ASV	Lamentations	2	10	The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, they keep silence; They have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.	25
ASV	Lamentations	2	11	Mine eyes do fail with tears, my heart is troubled; My liver is poured upon the earth, because of the destruction of the daughter of my people, Because the young children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.	25
ASV	Lamentations	2	12	They say to their mothers, Where is grain and wine? When they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city, When their soul is poured out into their mothers bosom.	25
ASV	Lamentations	2	13	What shall I testify unto thee? what shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I compare to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? For thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?	25
ASV	Lamentations	2	14	Thy prophets have seen for thee false and foolish visions; And they have not uncovered thine iniquity, to bring back thy captivity, But have seen for thee false oracles and causes of banishment.	25
ASV	Lamentations	2	15	All that pass by clap their hands at thee; They hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men called The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?	25
ASV	Lamentations	2	16	All thine enemies have opened their mouth wide against thee; They hiss and gnash the teeth; they say, We have swallowed her up; Certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.	25
ASV	Lamentations	2	17	Jehovah hath done that which he purposed; he hath fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old; He hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: And he hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee; he hath exalted the horn of thine adversaries.	25
ASV	Lamentations	2	18	Their heart cried unto the Lord: O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night; Give thyself no respite; let not the apple of thine eye cease.	25
ASV	Lamentations	2	19	Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches; Pour out thy heart like water before the face of the Lord: Lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger at the head of every street.	25
ASV	Lamentations	2	20	See, O Jehovah, and behold to whom thou hast done thus! Shall the women eat their fruit, the children that are dandled in the hands? Shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?	25
ASV	Lamentations	2	21	The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets; My virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword: Thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast slaughtered, and not pitied.	25
ASV	Lamentations	2	22	Thou hast called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side; And there was none that escaped or remained in the day of Jehovahs anger: Those that I have dandled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	1	I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	2	He hath led me and caused me to walk in darkness, and not in light.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	3	Surely against me he turneth his hand again and again all the day.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	4	My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	5	He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	6	He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	7	He hath walled me about, that I cannot go forth; he hath made my chain heavy.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	8	Yea, when I cry, and call for help, he shutteth out my prayer.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	9	He hath walled up my ways with hewn stone; he hath made my paths crooked.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	10	He is unto me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	11	He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; he hath made me desolate.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	12	He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	13	He hath caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my reins.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	14	I am become a derision to all my people, and their song all the day.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	15	He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath sated me with wormwood.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	16	He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones; he hath covered me with ashes.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	17	And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace; I forgat prosperity.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	18	And I said, My strength is perished, and mine expectation from Jehovah.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	19	Remember mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	20	My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is bowed down within me.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	21	This I recall to my mind; therefore have I hope.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	22	It is of Jehovahs lovingkindnesses that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	23	They are new every morning; great is thy faithfulness.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	24	Jehovah is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	25	Jehovah is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	26	It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Jehovah.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	27	It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	28	Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he hath laid it upon him.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	29	Let him put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	30	Let him give his cheek to him that smiteth him; let him be filled full with reproach.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	31	For the Lord will not cast off for ever.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	32	For though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	33	For he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	34	To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	35	To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High,	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	36	To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	37	Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	38	Out of the mouth of the Most High cometh there not evil and good?	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	39	Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	40	Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Jehovah.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	41	Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	42	We have transgressed and have rebelled; thou hast not pardoned.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	43	Thou hast covered with anger and pursued us; thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	44	Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	45	Thou hast made us an off-scouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	46	All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	47	Fear and the pit are come upon us, devastation and destruction.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	48	Mine eye runneth down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	49	Mine eye poureth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	50	Till Jehovah look down, and behold from heaven.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	51	Mine eye affecteth my soul, because of all the daughters of my city.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	52	They have chased me sore like a bird, they that are mine enemies without cause.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	53	They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone upon me.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	54	Waters flowed over my head; I said, I am cut off.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	55	I called upon thy name, O Jehovah, out of the lowest dungeon.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	56	Thou heardest my voice; hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	57	Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee; thou saidst, Fear not.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	58	O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	59	O Jehovah, thou hast seen my wrong; judge thou my cause.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	60	Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	61	Thou hast heard their reproach, O Jehovah, and all their devices against me,	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	62	The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	63	Behold thou their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	64	Thou wilt render unto them a recompense, O Jehovah, according to the work of their hands.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	65	Thou wilt give them hardness of heart, thy curse unto them.	25
ASV	Lamentations	3	66	Thou wilt pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of Jehovah.	25
ASV	Lamentations	4	1	How is the gold become dim! how is the most pure gold changed! The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.	25
ASV	Lamentations	4	2	The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!	25
ASV	Lamentations	4	3	Even the jackals draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: The daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.	25
ASV	Lamentations	4	4	The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: The young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them.	25
ASV	Lamentations	4	5	They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: They that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.	25
ASV	Lamentations	4	6	For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom, That was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands were laid upon her.	25
ASV	Lamentations	4	7	Her nobles were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk; They were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was as of sapphire.	25
ASV	Lamentations	4	8	Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: Their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.	25
ASV	Lamentations	4	9	They that are slain with the sword are better than they that are slain with hunger; For these pine away, stricken through, for want of the fruits of the field.	25
ASV	Lamentations	4	10	The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children; They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.	25
ASV	Lamentations	4	11	Jehovah hath accomplished his wrath, he hath poured out his fierce anger; And he hath kindled a fire in Zion, which hath devoured the foundations thereof.	25
ASV	Lamentations	4	12	The kings of the earth believed not, neither all the inhabitants of the world, That the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem.	25
ASV	Lamentations	4	13	It is because of the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, That have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.	25
ASV	Lamentations	4	14	They wander as blind men in the streets, they are polluted with blood, So that men cannot touch their garments.	25
ASV	Lamentations	4	15	Depart ye, they cried unto them, Unclean! depart, depart, touch not! When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations, They shall no more sojourn here.	25
ASV	Lamentations	4	16	The anger of Jehovah hath scattered them; he will no more regard them: They respected not the persons of the priests, they favored not the elders.	25
ASV	Lamentations	4	17	Our eyes do yet fail in looking for our vain help: In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save.	25
ASV	Lamentations	4	18	They hunt our steps, so that we cannot go in our streets: Our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.	25
ASV	Lamentations	4	19	Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens: They chased us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.	25
ASV	Lamentations	4	20	The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, was taken in their pits; Of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.	25
ASV	Lamentations	4	21	Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz: The cup shall pass through unto thee also; thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.	25
ASV	Lamentations	4	22	The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: He will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will uncover thy sins.	25
ASV	Lamentations	5	1	Remember, O Jehovah, what is come upon us: Behold, and see our reproach.	25
ASV	Lamentations	5	2	Our inheritance is turned unto strangers, Our houses unto aliens.	25
ASV	Lamentations	5	3	We are orphans and fatherless; Our mothers are as widows.	25
ASV	Lamentations	5	4	We have drunken our water for money; Our wood is sold unto us.	25
ASV	Lamentations	5	5	Our pursuers are upon our necks: We are weary, and have no rest.	25
ASV	Lamentations	5	6	We have given the hand to the Egyptians, And to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.	25
ASV	Lamentations	5	7	Our fathers sinned, and are not; And we have borne their iniquities.	25
ASV	Lamentations	5	8	Servants rule over us: There is none to deliver us out of their hand.	25
ASV	Lamentations	5	9	We get our bread at the peril of our lives, Because of the sword of the wilderness.	25
ASV	Lamentations	5	10	Our skin is black like an oven, Because of the burning heat of famine.	25
ASV	Lamentations	5	11	They ravished the women in Zion, The virgins in the cities of Judah.	25
ASV	Lamentations	5	12	Princes were hanged up by their hand: The faces of elders were not honored.	25
ASV	Lamentations	5	13	The young men bare the mill; And the children stumbled under the wood.	25
ASV	Lamentations	5	14	The elders have ceased from the gate, The young men from their music.	25
ASV	Lamentations	5	15	The joy of our heart is ceased; Our dance is turned into mourning.	25
ASV	Lamentations	5	16	The crown is fallen from our head: Woe unto us! for we have sinned.	25
ASV	Lamentations	5	17	For this our heart is faint; For these things our eyes are dim;	25
ASV	Lamentations	5	18	For the mountain of Zion, which is desolate: The foxes walk upon it.	25
ASV	Lamentations	5	19	Thou, O Jehovah, abidest for ever; Thy throne is from generation to generation.	25
ASV	Lamentations	5	20	Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, And forsake us so long time?	25
ASV	Lamentations	5	21	Turn thou us unto thee, O Jehovah, and we shall be turned; Renew our days as of old.	25
ASV	Lamentations	5	22	But thou hast utterly rejected us; Thou art very wroth against us.	25
ASV	Ezekiel	1	1	Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	2	In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachins captivity,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	3	the word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of Jehovah was there upon him.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	4	And I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with a fire infolding itself, and a brightness round about it, and out of the midst thereof as it were glowing metal, out of the midst of the fire.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	5	And out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	6	And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	7	And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calfs foot; and they sparkled like burnished brass.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	8	And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings thus:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	9	their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	10	As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	11	And their faces and their wings were separate above; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	12	And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they went.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	13	As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches: the fire went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	14	And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	15	Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold, one wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces thereof.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	16	The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto a beryl: and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	17	When they went, they went in their four directions: they turned not when they went.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	18	As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and they four had their rims full of eyes round about.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	19	And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	20	Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went; thither was the spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	21	When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	22	And over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of a firmament, like the terrible crystal to look upon, stretched forth over their heads above.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	23	And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	24	And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	25	And there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads: when they stood, they let down their wings.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	26	And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	27	And I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round abo	26
ASV	Ezekiel	1	28	As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one	26
ASV	Ezekiel	2	1	And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	2	2	And the Spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard him that spake unto me.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	2	3	And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	2	4	And the children are impudent and stiffhearted: I do sent thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	2	5	And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	2	6	And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	2	7	And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	2	8	But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	2	9	And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	2	10	And he spread it before me: and it was written within and without; and there were written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	1	And he said unto me, Son of man, eat that which thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	2	So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the roll.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	3	And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	4	And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	5	For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	6	not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken unto thee.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	7	But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are of hard forehead and of a stiff heart.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	8	Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	9	As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	10	Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	11	And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	12	Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from his place.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	13	And I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	14	So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	15	Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and to where they dwelt; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	16	And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	17	Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	18	When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	19	Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	20	Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	21	Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	22	And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	23	Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	24	Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thy house.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	25	But thou, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	26	and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	3	27	But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	4	1	Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and portray upon it a city, even Jerusalem:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	4	2	and lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it; set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it round about.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	4	3	And take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face toward it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	4	4	Moreover lie thou upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it; according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	4	5	For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be unto thee a number of days, even three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	4	6	And again, when thou hast accomplished these, thou shalt lie on thy right side, and shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah: forty days, each day for a year, have I appointed it unto thee.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	4	7	And thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with thine arm uncovered; and thou shalt prophesy against it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	4	8	And, behold, I lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to the other, till thou hast accomplished the days of thy siege.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	4	9	Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof; according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, even three hundred and ninety days,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	4	10	And thy food which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	4	11	And thou shalt drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	4	12	And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it in their sight with dung that cometh out of man.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	4	13	And Jehovah said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations whither I will drive them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	4	14	Then said I, Ah Lord Jehovah! behold, my soul hath not been polluted; for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	4	15	Then he said unto me, See, I have given thee cows dung for mans dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread thereon.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	4	16	Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with fearfulness; and they shall drink water by measure, and in dismay:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	4	17	that they may want bread and water, and be dismayed one with another, and pine away in their iniquity.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	5	1	And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp sword; as a barbers razor shalt thou take it unto thee, and shalt cause it to pass upon thy head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	5	2	A third part shalt thou burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and thou shalt take a third part, and smite with the sword round about it; and a third part thou shalt scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a	26
ASV	Ezekiel	5	3	And thou shalt take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	5	4	And of these again shalt thou take, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; therefrom shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	5	5	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This is Jerusalem; I have set her in the midst of the nations, and countries are round about her.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	5	6	And she hath rebelled against mine ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are round about her; for they have rejected mine ordinances, and as for my statutes, they have not walked in them	26
ASV	Ezekiel	5	7	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye are turbulent more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept mine ordinances, neither have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round abo	26
ASV	Ezekiel	5	8	therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I, even I, am against thee; and I will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	5	9	And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	5	10	Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments on thee; and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter unto all the winds.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	5	11	Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish thee; neither shall mine eye spare, and I also will have no pity.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	5	12	A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee; and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and a third part I will scatter unto all the winds, and will draw out a sword after	26
ASV	Ezekiel	5	13	Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest, and I shall be comforted; and they shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken in my zeal, when I have accomplished my wrath upon them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	5	14	Moreover I will make thee a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	5	15	So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment, unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments on thee in anger and in wrath, and in wrathful rebukes; (I, Jehovah, have spoken it;)	26
ASV	Ezekiel	5	16	when I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	5	17	and I will send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee: I, Jehovah, have spoken it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	6	1	And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	6	2	Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy unto them,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	6	3	and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys: Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	6	4	And your altars shall become desolate, and your sun-images shall be broken; and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	6	5	And I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	6	6	In all your dwelling-places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your sun-images may be hewn down, and your works may be ab	26
ASV	Ezekiel	6	7	And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	6	8	Yet will I leave a remnant, in that ye shall have some that escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	6	9	And those of you that escape shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captive, how that I have been broken with their lewd heart, which hath departed from me, and with they eyes, which play the harlot after their idols: and they s	26
ASV	Ezekiel	6	10	And they shall know that I am Jehovah: I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	6	11	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Smite with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas! because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel; for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	6	12	He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my wrath upon them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	6	13	And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the places where they offered swe	26
ASV	Ezekiel	6	14	And I will stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate and waste, from the wilderness toward Diblah, throughout all their habitations: and they shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	1	Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	2	And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto the land of Israel, An end: the end is come upon the four corners of the land.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	3	Now is the end upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	4	And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity; but I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	5	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: An evil, an only evil; behold, it cometh.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	6	An end is come, the end is come; it awaketh against thee; behold, it cometh.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	7	Thy doom is come unto thee, O inhabitant of the land: the time is come, the day is near, a day of tumult, and not of joyful shouting, upon the mountains.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	8	Now will I shortly pour out my wrath upon thee, and accomplish mine anger against thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	9	And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will bring upon thee according to thy ways; and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, do smite.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	10	Behold, the day, behold, it cometh: thy doom is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	11	Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness; none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth: neither shall there be eminency among them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	12	The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	13	For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they be yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, none shall return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	14	They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but none goeth to the battle; for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	15	The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword: and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	16	But those of them that escape shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, every one in his iniquity.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	17	All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	18	They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	19	They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Jehovah: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels; beca	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	20	As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things therein: therefore have I made it unto them as an unclean thing.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	21	And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	22	My face will I turn also from them, and they shall profane my secret place; and robbers shall enter into it, and profane it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	23	Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	24	Wherefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pride of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be profaned.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	25	Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	26	Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumor shall be upon rumor; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	7	27	The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	8	1	And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord Jehovah fell there upon me.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	8	2	Then I beheld, and, lo, a likeness as the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his loins and downward, fire; and from his loins and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as it were glowing metal.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	8	3	And he put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner court that looketh toward the north; where	26
ASV	Ezekiel	8	4	And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	8	5	Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	8	6	And he said unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel do commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but thou shalt again see yet other great abominations.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	8	7	And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	8	8	Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold, a door.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	8	9	And he said unto me, Go in, and see the wicked abominations that they do here.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	8	10	So I went in and saw; and behold, every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	8	11	And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel; and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, every man with his censer in his hand; and the odor of the cloud of incense went up.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	8	12	Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his chambers of imagery? for they say, Jehovah seeth us not; Jehovah hath forsaken the land.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	8	13	He said also unto me, Thou shalt again see yet other great abominations which they do.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	8	14	Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Jehovahs house which was toward the north; and behold, there sat the women weeping for Tammuz.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	8	15	Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? thou shalt again see yet greater abominations than these.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	8	16	And he brought me into the inner court of Jehovahs house; and behold, at the door of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of Jehovah, and their faces toward the east; an	26
ASV	Ezekiel	8	17	Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger: and, lo	26
ASV	Ezekiel	8	18	Therefore will I also deal in wrath; mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	9	1	Then he cried in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause ye them that have charge over the city to draw near, every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	9	2	And behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lieth toward the north, every man with his slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man in the midst of them clothed in linen, with a writers inkhorn by his side. And they went in, and stood besi	26
ASV	Ezekiel	9	3	And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writers inkhorn by his side.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	9	4	And Jehovah said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	9	5	And to the others he said in my hearing, Go ye through the city after him, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	9	6	slay utterly the old man, the young man and the virgin, and little children and women; but come not near any man upon whom is the mark: and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the old men that were before the house.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	9	7	And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and smote in the city.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	9	8	And it came to pass, while they were smiting, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy wrath upon Jerusalem?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	9	9	Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of wrestling of judgment: for they say, Jehovah hath forsaken the land, and Jehovah seeth not.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	9	10	And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way upon their head.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	9	11	And behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	10	1	Then I looked, and behold, in the firmament that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	10	2	And he spake unto the man clothed in linen, and said, Go in between the whirling wheels, even under the cherub, and fill both thy hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	10	3	Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	10	4	And the glory of Jehovah mounted up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Jehovahs glory.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	10	5	And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaketh.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	10	6	And it came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim, that he went in, and stood beside a wheel.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	10	7	And the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed in linen, who took it and went out.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	10	8	And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a mans hand under their wings.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	10	9	And I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like unto a beryl stone.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	10	10	And as for their appearance, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel have been within a wheel.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	10	11	When they went, they went in their four directions: they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	10	12	And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	10	13	As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, the whirling wheels.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	10	14	And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third face the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	10	15	And the cherubim mounted up: this is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	10	16	And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also turned not from beside them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	10	17	When they stood, these stood; and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	10	18	And the glory of Jehovah went forth from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	10	19	And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels beside them: and they stood at the door of the east gate of Jehovahs house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	10	20	This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	10	21	Every one had four faces, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	10	22	And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves; they went every one straight forward.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	1	Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of Jehovahs house, which looketh eastward: and behold, at the door of the gate five and twenty men; and I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Bena	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	2	And he said unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise iniquity, and that give wicked counsel in this city;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	3	that say, The time is not near to build houses: this city is the caldron, and we are the flesh.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	4	Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	5	And the Spirit of Jehovah fell upon me, and he said unto me, Speak, Thus saith Jehovah: Thus have ye said, O house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	6	Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	7	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron; but ye shall be brought forth out of the midst of it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	8	Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword upon you, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	9	And I will bring you forth out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	10	Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	11	This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; I will judge you in the border of Israel;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	12	and ye shall know that I am Jehovah: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither have ye executed mine ordinances, but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	13	And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	14	And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	15	Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel, all of them, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from Jehovah; unto us is this land given for a possession.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	16	Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Whereas I have removed them far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they are come.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	17	Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	18	And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	19	And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	20	that they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	21	But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	22	Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels were beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	23	And the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	24	And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	11	25	Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that Jehovah had showed me.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	1	The word of Jehovah also came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	2	Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of the rebellious house, that have eyes to see, and see not, that have ears to hear, and hear not; for they are a rebellious house.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	3	Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	4	And thou shalt bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing; and thou shalt go forth thyself at even in their sight, as when men go forth into exile.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	5	Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	6	In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulder, and carry it forth in the dark; thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the land: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	7	And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for removing, and in the even I digged through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the dark, and bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	8	And in the morning came the word of Jehovah unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	9	Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	10	Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel among whom they are.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	11	Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them; they shall go into exile, into captivity.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	12	And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, because he shall not see the land with his eyes.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	13	My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	14	And I will scatter toward every wind all that are round about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	15	And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	16	But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the nations whither they come; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	17	Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	18	Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with fearfulness;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	19	and say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with fearfulness, and drink their water in dismay, that her land may be desolate, and despoiled of	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	20	And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be a desolation; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	21	And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	22	Son of man, what is this proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	23	Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the fulfilment of every vision.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	24	For there shall be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	25	For I am Jehovah; I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall be performed; it shall be no more deferred: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I speak the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	26	Again the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	27	Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many day to come, and he prophesieth of times that are far off.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	12	28	Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: There shall none of my words be deferred any more, but the word which I shall speak shall be performed, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	13	1	And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	13	2	Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own heart, Hear ye the word of Jehovah:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	13	3	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!	26
ASV	Ezekiel	13	4	O Israel, thy prophets have been like foxes in the waste places.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	13	5	Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither built up the wall for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in the day of Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	13	6	They have seen falsehood and lying divination, that say, Jehovah saith; but Jehovah hath not sent them: and they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	13	7	Have ye not seen a false vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, in that ye say, Jehovah saith; albeit I have not spoken?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	13	8	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have spoken falsehood, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	13	9	And my hand shall be against the prophets that see false visions, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the council of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; a	26
ASV	Ezekiel	13	10	Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there is no peace; and when one buildeth up a wall, behold, they daub it with untempered mortar:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	13	11	say unto them that daub it with untempered mortar, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	13	12	Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	13	13	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my wrath; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in wrath to consume it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	13	14	So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered mortar, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be uncovered; and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am Jeh	26
ASV	Ezekiel	13	15	Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered mortar; and I will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	13	16	to wit, the prophets of Israel that prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and that see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	13	17	And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, that prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	13	18	and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the women that sew pillows upon all elbows, and make kerchiefs for the head of persons of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and save souls alive for yourselves?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	13	19	And ye have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hearken unto lies.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	13	20	Wherefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms; and I will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	13	21	Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	13	22	Because with lies ye have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	13	23	Therefore ye shall no more see false visions, nor divine divinations: and I will deliver my people out of your hand; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	14	1	Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	14	2	And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	14	3	Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all by them?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	14	4	Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Every man of the house of Israel that taketh his idols into his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I Jehovah will ans	26
ASV	Ezekiel	14	5	that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	14	6	Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Return ye, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	14	7	For every one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that separateth himself from me, and taketh his idols into his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet to inquire fo	26
ASV	Ezekiel	14	8	and I will set my face against that man, and will make him an astonishment, for a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	14	9	And if the prophet be deceived and speak a word, I, Jehovah, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	14	10	And they shall bear their iniquity: the iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of him that seeketh unto him;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	14	11	that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	14	12	And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	14	13	Son of man, when a land sinneth against me by committing a trespass, and I stretch out my hand upon it, and break the staff of the bread thereof, and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	14	14	though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	14	15	If I cause evil beasts to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it be made desolate, so that no man may pass through because of the beasts;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	14	16	though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only should be delivered, but the land should be desolate.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	14	17	Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off from it man and beast;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	14	18	though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only should be delivered themselves.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	14	19	Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	14	20	though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither son nor daughter; they should but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	14	21	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the evil beasts, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast!	26
ASV	Ezekiel	14	22	Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be carried forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings; and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon	26
ASV	Ezekiel	14	23	And they shall comfort you, when ye see their way and their doings; and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	15	1	And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	15	2	Son of man, what is the vine-tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	15	3	Shall wood be taken thereof to make any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	15	4	Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire hath devoured both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned: is it profitable for any work?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	15	5	Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned, shall it yet be meet for any work!	26
ASV	Ezekiel	15	6	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As the vine-tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	15	7	And I will set my face against them; they shall go forth from the fire, but the fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I set my face against them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	15	8	And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	1	Again the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	2	Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	3	and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto Jerusalem: Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of the Canaanite; the Amorite was thy father, and thy mother was a Hittite.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	4	And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to cleanse thee; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	5	No eye pitied thee, to do any of these things unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, for that thy person was abhorred, in the day that thou wast born.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	6	And when I passed by thee, and saw thee weltering in thy blood, I said unto thee, Though thou art in thy blood, live; yea, I said unto thee, Though thou art in thy blood, live.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	7	I caused thee to multiply as that which groweth in the field, and thou didst increase and wax great, and thou attainedst to excellent ornament; thy breasts were fashioned, and thy hair was grown; yet thou wast naked and bare.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	8	Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord Jehovah, and thou becamest mi	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	9	Then washed I thee with water; yea, I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	10	I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with sealskin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and covered thee with silk.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	11	And I decked thee with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	12	And I put a ring upon thy nose, and ear-rings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	13	Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil; and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper unto royal estate.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	14	And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty; for it was perfect, through my majesty which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	15	But thou didst trust in thy beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy whoredoms on every one that passed by; his it was.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	16	And thou didst take of thy garments, and madest for thee high places decked with divers colors, and playedst the harlot upon them: the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	17	Thou didst also take thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest for thee images of men, and didst play the harlot with them;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	18	and thou tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them, and didst set mine oil and mine incense before them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	19	My bread also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou didst even set it before them for a sweet savor; and thus it was, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	20	Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Were thy whoredoms a small matter,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	21	that thou hast slain my children, and delivered them up, in causing them to pass through the fire unto them?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	22	And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast weltering in thy blood.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	23	And it is come to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord Jehovah,)	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	24	that thou hast built unto thee a vaulted place, and hast made thee a lofty place in every street.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	25	Thou hast built thy lofty place at the head of every way, and hast made thy beauty an abomination, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredom.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	26	Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians, thy neighbors, great of flesh; and hast multiplied thy whoredom, to provoke me to anger.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	27	Behold therefore, I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, that are ashamed of thy lewd way.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	28	Thou hast played the harlot also with the Assyrians, because thou wast insatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet thou wast not satisfied.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	29	Thou hast moreover multiplied thy whoredom unto the land of traffic, unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	30	How weak is thy heart, saith the Lord Jehovah, seeing thou doest all these things, the work of an impudent harlot;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	31	in that thou buildest thy vaulted place at the head of every way, and makest thy lofty place in every street, and hast not been as a harlot, in that thou scornest hire.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	32	A wife that committeth adultery! that taketh strangers instead of her husband!	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	33	They give gifts to all harlots; but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and bribest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredoms.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	34	And thou art different from other women in thy whoredoms, in that none followeth thee to play the harlot; and whereas thou givest hire, and no hire is given unto thee, therefore thou art different.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	35	Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of Jehovah:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	36	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness uncovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers; and because of all the idols of thy abominations, and for the blood of thy children, that thou didst give unto them;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	37	therefore behold, I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them against thee on every side, and will uncover thy nakedness unto them, that t	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	38	And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring upon thee the blood of wrath and jealousy.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	39	I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thy vaulted place, and break down thy lofty places; and they shall strip thee of thy clothes, and take thy fair jewels; and they shall leave thee naked and bare.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	40	They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	41	And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women; and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou shalt also give no hire any more.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	42	So will I cause my wrath toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	43	Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast raged against me in all these things; therefore, behold, I also will bring thy way upon thy head, saith the Lord Jehovah: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness with all thine abominations.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	44	Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	45	Thou art the daughter of thy mother, that loatheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children: your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	46	And thine elder sister is Samaria, that dwelleth at thy left hand, she and her daughters; and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	47	Yet hast thou not walked in their ways, nor done after their abominations; but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast more corrupt than they in all thy ways.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	48	As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	49	Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom: pride, fulness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	50	And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	51	Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters by all thine abominations which thou hast done.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	52	Thou also, bear thou thine own shame, in that thou hast given judgment for thy sisters; through thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous that thou: yea, be thou also confounded, and bear thy shame, in that thou	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	53	And I will turn again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	54	that thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be ashamed because of all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	55	And thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate; and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate; and thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	56	For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	57	before thy wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, that do despite unto thee round about.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	58	Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	59	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also deal with thee as thou hast done, who hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	60	Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	61	Then shalt thou remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder sisters and thy younger; and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	62	And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	16	63	that thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame, when I have forgiven thee all that thou hast done, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	1	And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	2	Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	3	and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: A great eagle with great wings and long pinions, full of feathers, which had divers colors, came unto Lebanon, and took the top of the cedar:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	4	he cropped off the topmost of the young twigs thereof, and carried it unto a land of traffic; he set it in a city of merchants.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	5	He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful soil; he placed it beside many waters; he set it as a willow-tree.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	6	And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	7	There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend its roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him, from the beds of its plantation, that he might water it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	8	It was planted in a good soil by many waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	9	Say thou, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it may wither; that all its fresh springing leaves may wither? and not by a strong arm or much people can it be raised fro	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	10	Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the beds where it grew.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	11	Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	12	Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and brought them to him to Babylon:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	13	and he took of the seed royal, and made a covenant with him; he also brought him under an oath, and took away the mighty of the land;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	14	that the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	15	But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? shall he break the covenant, and yet escape?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	16	As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	17	Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company help him in the war, when they cast up mounds and build forts, to cut off many persons.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	18	For he hath despised the oath by breaking the covenant; and behold, he had given his hand, and yet hath done all these things; he shall not escape.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	19	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, I will even bring it upon his own head.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	20	And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	21	And all his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward every wind: and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	22	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also take of the lofty top of the cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I will plant it upon a high and lofty mountain:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	23	in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it; and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all birds of every wing; in the shade of the branches thereof shall they dwell.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	17	24	And all the trees of the field shall know that I, Jehovah, have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish; I, Jehovah, have spoken and have done it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	1	The word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	2	What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the childrens teeth are set on edge?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	3	As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	4	Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	5	But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	6	and hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbors wife, neither hath come near to a woman in her impurity,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	7	and hath not wronged any, but hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath taken nought by robbery, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	8	he that hath not given forth upon interest, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true justice between man and man,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	9	hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept mine ordinances, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	10	If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth any one of these things,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	11	and that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbors wife,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	12	hath wronged the poor and needy, hath taken by robbery, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	13	hath given forth upon interest, and hath taken increase; shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	14	Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his fathers sins, which he hath done, and feareth, and doeth not such like;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	15	that hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbors wife,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	16	neither hath wronged any, hath not taken aught to pledge, neither hath taken by robbery, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	17	that hath withdrawn his hand from the poor, that hath not received interest nor increase, hath executed mine ordinances, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	18	As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, robbed his brother, and did that which is not good among his people, behold, he shall die in his iniquity.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	19	Yet say ye, Wherefore doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? when the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	20	The soul that sinneth, it shall die: the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	21	But if the wicked turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	22	None of his transgressions that he hath committed shall be remembered against him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	23	Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked? saith the Lord Jehovah; and not rather that he should return from his way, and live?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	24	But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? None of his righteous deeds that he hath done shall be remembered: in his trespass t	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	25	Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel: Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	26	When the righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth therein; in his iniquity that he hath done shall he die.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	27	Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	28	Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	29	Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	30	Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord Jehovah. Return ye, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	31	Cast away from you all your transgressions, wherein ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	18	32	For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord Jehovah: wherefore turn yourselves, and live.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	19	1	Moreover, take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	19	2	and say, What was thy mother? A lioness: she couched among lions, in the midst of the young lions she nourished her whelps.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	19	3	And she brought up one of her whelps: he became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	19	4	The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit; and they brought him with hooks unto the land of Egypt.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	19	5	Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	19	6	And he went up and down among the lions; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	19	7	And he knew their palaces, and laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, because of the noise of his roaring.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	19	8	Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces; and they spread their net over him; he was taken in their pit.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	19	9	And they put him in a cage with hooks, and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into strongholds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	19	10	Thy mother was like a vine, in thy blood, planted by the waters: it was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	19	11	And it had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and their stature was exalted among the thick boughs, and they were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	19	12	But it was plucked up in fury, it was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit: its strong rods were broken off and withered; the fire consumed them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	19	13	And now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	19	14	And fire is gone out of the rods of its branches, it hath devoured its fruit, so that there is in it no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	1	And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of Jehovah, and sat before me.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	2	And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	3	Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Is it to inquire of me that ye are come? As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	4	Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	5	and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day when I chose Israel, and sware unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I sware unto them, saying, I am Jehovah your God;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	6	in that day I sware unto them, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	7	And I said unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am Jehovah your God.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	8	But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me; they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger against them	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	9	But I wrought for my names sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among which they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	10	So I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	11	And I gave them my statutes, and showed them mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live in them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	12	Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am Jehovah that sanctifieth them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	13	But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they rejected mine ordinances, which if a man keep, he shall live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	14	But I wrought for my names sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	15	Moreover also I sware unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	16	because they rejected mine ordinances, and walked not in my statutes, and profaned my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	17	Nevertheless mine eye spared them, and I destroyed them not, neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	18	And I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	19	I am Jehovah your God: walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	20	and hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am Jehovah your God.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	21	But the children rebelled against me; they walked not in my statutes, neither kept mine ordinances to do them, which if a man do, he shall live in them; they profaned my sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger aga	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	22	Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and wrought for my names sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them forth.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	23	Moreover I sware unto them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	24	because they had not executed mine ordinances, but had rejected my statutes, and had profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers idols.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	25	Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances wherein they should not live;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	26	and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	27	Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In this moreover have your fathers blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	28	For when I had brought them into the land, which I sware to give unto them, then they saw every high hill, and every thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering; there also they made thei	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	29	Then I said unto them, What meaneth the high place whereunto ye go? So the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	30	Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Do ye pollute yourselves after the manner of your fathers? and play ye the harlot after their abominations?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	31	and when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, do ye pollute yourselves with all your idols unto this day? and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of b	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	32	and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, in that ye say, We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	33	As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out, will I be king over you:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	34	and I will bring you out from the peoples, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	35	and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	36	Like as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I enter into judgment with you, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	37	And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	38	and I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me; I will bring them forth out of the land where they sojourn, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	39	As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Go ye, serve every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken unto me; but my holy name shall ye no more profane with your gifts, and with your idols.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	40	For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them, serve me in the land: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the first-fruits of yo	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	41	As a sweet savor will I accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	42	And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country which I sware to give unto your fathers.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	43	And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have polluted yourselves; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	44	And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have dealt with you for my names sake, not according to your evil ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	45	And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	46	Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the field in the South;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	47	and say to the forest of the South, Hear the word of Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	48	And all flesh shall see that I, Jehovah, have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	20	49	Then said I, Ah Lord Jehovah! they say of me, Is he not a speaker of parables?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	1	And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	2	Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward the sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of Israel;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	3	and say to the land of Israel, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	4	Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	5	and all flesh shall know that I, Jehovah, have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath; it shall not return any more.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	6	Sigh therefore, thou son of man; with the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness shalt thou sigh before their eyes.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	7	And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt say, Because of the tidings, for it cometh; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: be	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	8	And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	9	Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith Jehovah: Say, A sword, a sword, it is sharpened, and also furbished;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	10	it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter; it is furbished that it may be as lightning: shall we then make mirth? the rod of my son, it contemneth every tree.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	11	And it is given to be furbished, that it may be handled: the sword, it is sharpened, yea, it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	12	Cry and wail, son of man; for it is upon my people, it is upon all the princes of Israel: they are delivered over to the sword with my people; smite therefore upon thy thigh.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	13	For there is a trial; and what if even the rod that contemneth shall be no more? saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	14	Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thy hands together; and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the deadly wounded: it is the sword of the great one that is deadly wounded, which entereth into their chambers.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	15	I have set the threatening sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied: ah! it is made as lightning, it is pointed for slaughter.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	16	Gather thee together, go to the right, set thyself in array, go to the left, whithersoever thy face is set.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	17	I will also smite my hands together, and I will cause my wrath to rest: I, Jehovah, have spoken it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	18	The word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	19	Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come; they twain shall come forth out of one land: and mark out a place, mark it out at the head of the way to the city.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	20	Thou shalt appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	21	For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he shook the arrows to and fro, he consulted the teraphim, he looked in the liver.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	22	In his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build forts.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	23	And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths unto them; but he bringeth iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	24	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	25	And thou, O deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day is come, in the time of the iniquity of the end,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	26	thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Remove the mitre, and take off the crown; this shall be no more the same; exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	27	I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: this also shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	28	And thou, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach; and say thou, A sword, a sword is drawn, for the slaughter it is furbished, to cause it to devour, that it may be as ligh	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	29	while they see for thee false visions, while they divine lies unto thee, to lay thee upon the necks of the wicked that are deadly wounded, whose day is come in the time of the iniquity of the end.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	30	Cause it to return into its sheath. In the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy birth, will I judge thee.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	31	And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee; I will blow upon thee with the fire of my wrath; and I will deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, skilful to destroy.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	21	32	Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I, Jehovah, have spoken it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	1	Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	2	And thou, son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? then cause her to know all her abominations.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	3	And thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: A city that sheddeth blood in the midst of her, that her time may come, and that maketh idols against herself to defile her!	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	4	Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed, and art defiled in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the nations, and a mocki	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	5	Those that are near, and those that are far from thee, shall mock thee, thou infamous one and full of tumult.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	6	Behold, the princes of Israel, every one according to his power, have been in thee to shed blood.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	7	In thee have they set light by father and mother; in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the sojourner; in thee have they wronged the fatherless and the widow.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	8	Thou hast despised my holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	9	Slanderous men have been in thee to shed blood; and in thee they have eaten upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they have committed lewdness.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	10	In thee have they uncovered their fathers nakedness; in thee have they humbled her that was unclean in her impurity.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	11	And one hath committed abomination with his neighbors wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his fathers daughter.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	12	In thee have they taken bribes to shed blood; thou hast taken interest and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbors by oppression, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	13	Behold, therefore, I have smitten my hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	14	Can thy heart endure, or can thy hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I, Jehovah, have spoken it, and will do it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	15	And I will scatter thee among the nations, and disperse thee through the countries; and I will consume thy filthiness out of thee.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	16	And thou shalt be profaned in thyself, in the sight of the nations; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	17	And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	18	Son of man, the house of Israel is become dross unto me: all of them are brass and tin and iron and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are the dross of silver.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	19	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye are all become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	20	As they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my wrath, and I will lay you there, and melt you.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	21	Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	22	As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have poured out my wrath upon you.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	23	And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	24	Son of man, say unto her, Thou art a land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	25	There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey: they have devoured souls; they take treasure and precious things; they have made her widows many in the midst thereof.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	26	Her priests have done violence to my law, and have profaned my holy things: they have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they caused men to discern between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	27	Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, that they may get dishonest gain.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	28	And her prophets have daubed for them with untempered mortar, seeing false visions, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, when Jehovah hath not spoken.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	29	The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery; yea, they have vexed the poor and needy, and have oppressed the sojourner wrongfully.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	30	And I sought for a man among them, that should build up the wall, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found none.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	22	31	Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I brought upon their heads, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	1	The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	2	Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	3	and they played the harlot in Egypt; they played the harlot in their youth; there were their breasts pressed, and there was handled the bosom of their virginity.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	4	And the names of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister: and they became mine, and they bare sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	5	And Oholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbors,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	6	who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	7	And she bestowed her whoredoms upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and on whomsoever she doted, with all their idols she defiled herself.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	8	Neither hath she left her whoredoms since the days of Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her, and they handled the bosom of her virginity; and they poured out their whoredom upon her.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	9	Wherefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	10	These uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters; and her they slew with the sword: and she became a byword among women; for they executed judgments upon her.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	11	And her sister Oholibah saw this, yet was she more corrupt in her doting than she, and in her whoredoms which were more than the whoredoms of her sister.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	12	She doted upon the Assyrians, governors and rulers, her neighbors, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	13	And I saw that she was defiled; they both took one way.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	14	And she increased her whoredoms; for she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	15	girded with girdles upon their loins, with flowing turbans upon their heads, all of them princes to look upon, after the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their nativity.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	16	And as soon as she saw them she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	17	And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	18	So she uncovered her whoredoms, and uncovered her nakedness: then my soul was alienated from her, like as my soul was alienated from her sister.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	19	Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, remembering the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	20	And she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	21	Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in the handling of thy bosom by the Egyptians for the breasts of thy youth.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	22	Therefore, O Oholibah, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy soul is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	23	the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them; desirable young men, governors and rulers all of them, princes and men of renown, all of them riding upon horses.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	24	And they shall come against thee with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and with a company of peoples; they shall set themselves against thee with buckler and shield and helmet round about; and I will commit the judgment unto them, and they shall judge thee	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	25	And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal with thee in fury; they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy residue shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fir	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	26	They shall also strip thee of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	27	Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt; so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	28	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy soul is alienated;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	29	and they shall deal with thee in hatred, and shall take away all thy labor, and shall leave thee naked and bare; and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be uncovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	30	These things shall be done unto thee, for that thou hast played the harlot after the nations, and because thou art polluted with their idols.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	31	Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thy hand.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	32	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou shalt drink of thy sisters cup, which is deep and large; thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	33	Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	34	Thou shalt even drink it and drain it out, and thou shalt gnaw the sherds thereof, and shalt tear thy breasts; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	35	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	36	Jehovah said moreover unto me: Son of man, wilt thou judge Oholah and Oholibah? then declare unto them their abominations.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	37	For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands; and with their idols have they committed adultery; and they have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass through the fire unto them to be devoured.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	38	Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	39	For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of my house.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	40	And furthermore ye have sent for men that come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent, and, lo, they came; for whom thou didst wash thyself, paint thine eyes, and deck thyself with ornaments,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	41	and sit upon a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon thou didst set mine incense and mine oil.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	42	And the voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with men of the common sort were brought drunkards from the wilderness; and they put bracelets upon the hands of them twain, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	43	Then said I of her that was old in adulteries, Now will they play the harlot with her, and she with them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	44	And they went in unto her, as they go in unto a harlot: so went they in unto Oholah and unto Oholibah, the lewd women.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	45	And righteous men, they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	46	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will bring up a company against them, and will give them to be tossed to and fro and robbed.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	47	And the company shall stone them with stones, and despatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	48	Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	23	49	And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols; and ye shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	1	Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	2	Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this selfsame day: the king of Babylon drew close unto Jerusalem this selfsame day.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	3	And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Set on the caldron, set it on, and also pour water into it:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	4	gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	5	Take the choice of the flock, and also a pile of wood for the bones under the caldron; make it boil well; yea, let the bones thereof be boiled in the midst of it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	6	Wherefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city, to the caldron whose rust is therein, and whose rust is not gone out of it! take out of it piece after piece; No lot is fallen upon it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	7	For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the bare rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	8	That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have set her blood upon the bare rock, that it should not be covered.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	9	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	10	Heap on the wood, make the fire hot, boil well the flesh, and make thick the broth, and let the bones be burned.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	11	Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that it may be hot, and the brass thereof may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the rust of it may be consumed.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	12	She hath wearied herself with toil; yet her great rust goeth not forth out of her; her rust goeth not forth by fire.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	13	In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have cleansed thee and thou wast not cleansed, thou shalt not be cleansed from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my wrath toward thee to rest.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	14	I, Jehovah, have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it: I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	15	Also the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	16	Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet thou shalt neither mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	17	Sigh, but not aloud, make no mourning for the dead; bind thy headtire upon thee, and put thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	18	So I spake unto the people in the morning; and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	19	And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	20	Then I said unto them, The word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	21	Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left behind shall fall by t	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	22	And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	23	And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away in your iniquities, and moan one toward another.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	24	Thus shall Ezekiel be unto you a sign; according to all that he hath done shall ye do: when this cometh, then shall ye know that I am the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	25	And thou, son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their heart, their sons and their daughters,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	26	that in that day he that escapeth shall come unto thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	24	27	In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him that is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: so shalt thou be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	25	1	And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	25	2	Son of man, set thy face toward the children of Ammon, and prophesy against them:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	25	3	and say unto the children of Ammon, Hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was made desolate; and against the house of J	26
ASV	Ezekiel	25	4	therefore, behold, I will deliver thee to the children of the east for a possession, and they shall set their encampments in thee, and make their dwellings in thee; they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	25	5	And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the children of Ammon a couching-place for flocks: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	25	6	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast clapped thy hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced with all the despite of thy soul against the land of Israel;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	25	7	therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the nations; and I will cut thee off from the peoples, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am	26
ASV	Ezekiel	25	8	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the nations;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	25	9	therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	25	10	unto the children of the east, to go against the children of Ammon; and I will give them for a possession, that the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	25	11	and I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	25	12	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	25	13	therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, I will stretch out my hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; even unto Dedan shall they fall by the sword.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	25	14	And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my wrath; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	25	15	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with despite of soul to destroy with perpetual enmity;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	25	16	therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	25	17	And I will execute great vengeance upon them with wrathful rebukes; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	26	1	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	26	2	Son of man, because that Tyre hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken that was the gate of the peoples; she is turned unto me; I shall be replenished, now that she is laid waste:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	26	3	therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I am against thee, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth its waves to come up.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	26	4	And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her a bare rock.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	26	5	She shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah; and she shall become a spoil to the nations.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	26	6	And her daughters that are in the field shall be slain with the sword: and they shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	26	7	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring upon Tyre Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and a company, and much people.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	26	8	He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field; and he shall make forts against thee, and cast up a mound against thee, and raise up the buckler against thee.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	26	9	And he shall set his battering engines against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	26	10	By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wagons, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	26	11	With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets; he shall slay thy people with the sword; and the pillars of thy strength shall go down to the ground.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	26	12	And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise; and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses; and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the waters.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	26	13	And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	26	14	And I will make thee a bare rock; thou shalt be a place for the spreading of nets; thou shalt be built no more: for I Jehovah have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	26	15	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to Tyre: shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded groan, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	26	16	Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay aside their robes, and strip off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble every moment, and be asto	26
ASV	Ezekiel	26	17	And they shall take up a lamentation over thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited by seafaring men, the renowned city, that was strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, that caused their terror to be on all that dwelt there!	26
ASV	Ezekiel	26	18	Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be dismayed at thy departure.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	26	19	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and the great waters shall cover thee;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	26	20	then will I bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, to the people of old time, and will make thee to dwell in the nether parts of the earth, in the places that are desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited	26
ASV	Ezekiel	26	21	I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt no more have any being; though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	1	The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	2	And thou, son of man, take up a lamentation over Tyre;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	3	and say unto Tyre, O thou that dwellest at the entry of the sea, that art the merchant of the peoples unto many isles, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou, O Tyre, hast said, I am perfect in beauty.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	4	Thy borders are in the heart of the seas; thy builders have perfected thy beauty.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	5	They have made all thy planks of fir-trees from Senir; they have taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for thee.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	6	Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; they have made thy benches of ivory inlaid in boxwood, from the isles of Kittim.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	7	Of fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was thy sail, that it might be to thee for an ensign; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was thine awning.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	8	The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were thy rowers: thy wise men, O Tyre, were in thee, they were thy pilots.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	9	The old men of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to deal in thy merchandise.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	10	Persia and Lud and Put were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	11	The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about, and valorous men were in thy towers; they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have perfected thy beauty.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	12	Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded for thy wares.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	13	Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy traffickers; they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass for thy merchandise.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	14	They of the house of Togarmah traded for thy wares with horses and war-horses and mules.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	15	The men of Dedan were thy traffickers; many isles were the mart of thy hand: they brought thee in exchange horns of ivory and ebony.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	16	Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of thy handiworks: they traded for thy wares with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and rubies.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	17	Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy traffickers: they traded for thy merchandise wheat of Minnith, and pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	18	Damascus was thy merchant for the multitude of thy handiworks, by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches, with the wine of Helbon, and white wool.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	19	Vedan and Javan traded with yarn for thy wares: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were among thy merchandise.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	20	Dedan was thy trafficker in precious cloths for riding.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	21	Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they were the merchants of thy hand; in lambs, and rams, and goats, in these were they thy merchants.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	22	The traffickers of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy traffickers; they traded for thy wares with the chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	23	Haran and Canneh and Eden, the traffickers of Sheba, Asshur and Chilmad, were thy traffickers.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	24	These were thy traffickers in choice wares, in wrappings of blue and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	25	The ships of Tarshish were thy caravans for thy merchandise: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the heart of the seas.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	26	Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the heart of the seas.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	27	Thy riches, and thy wares, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the dealers in thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that are in thee, with all thy company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the heart of the seas	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	28	At the sound of the cry of thy pilots the suburbs shall shake.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	29	And all that handled the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships; they shall stand upon the land,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	30	and shall cause their voice to be heard over thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	31	and they shall make themselves bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee in bitterness of soul with bitter mourning.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	32	And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, saying, Who is there like Tyre, like her that is brought to silence in the midst of the sea?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	33	When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many peoples; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	34	In the time that thou wast broken by the seas in the depths of the waters, thy merchandise and all thy company did fall in the midst of thee.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	35	All the inhabitants of the isles are astonished at thee, and their kings are horribly afraid; they are troubled in their countenance.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	27	36	The merchants among the peoples hiss at thee; thou art become a terror, and thou shalt nevermore have any being.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	1	The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	2	Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyre, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thy heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a god, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art man, and not God, though thou didst set thy heart as the	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	3	behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that is hidden from thee;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	4	by thy wisdom and by thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	5	by thy great wisdom and by thy traffic hast thou increased thy riches, and thy heart is lifted up because of thy riches;-	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	6	therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast set thy heart as the heart of God,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	7	therefore, behold, I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	8	They shall bring thee down to the pit; and thou shalt die the death of them that are slain, in the heart of the seas.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	9	Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but thou art man, and not God, in the hand of him that woundeth thee.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	10	Thou shalt die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	11	Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	12	Son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	13	Thou wast in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, the topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pi	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	14	Thou wast the anointed cherub that covereth: and I set thee, so that thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	15	Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till unrighteousness was found in thee.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	16	By the abundance of thy traffic they filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore have I cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God; and I have destroyed thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	17	Thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty; thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I have cast thee to the ground; I have laid thee before kings, that they may behold thee.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	18	By the multitude of thine iniquities, in the unrighteousness of thy traffic, thou hast profaned thy sanctuaries; therefore have I brought forth a fire from the midst of thee; it hath devoured thee, and I have turned thee to ashes upon the earth in the sig	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	19	All they that know thee among the peoples shall be astonished at thee: thou art become a terror, and thou shalt nevermore have any being.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	20	And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	21	Son of man, set thy face toward Sidon, and prophesy against it,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	22	and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Sidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	23	For I will send pestilence into her, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her, with the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	24	And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor a hurting thorn of any that are round about them, that did despite unto them; and they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	25	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations, then shall they dwell in their own land which I gave to my servant Jac	26
ASV	Ezekiel	28	26	And they shall dwell securely therein; yea, they shall build houses, and plant vineyards, and shall dwell securely, when I have executed judgments upon all those that do them despite round about them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah their God.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	29	1	In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	29	2	Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	29	3	speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster that lieth in the midst of his rivers, that hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	29	4	And I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales; and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, with all the fish of thy rivers which stick unto thy scales.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	29	5	And I will cast thee forth into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open field; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered; I have given thee for food to the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the heave	26
ASV	Ezekiel	29	6	And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am Jehovah, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	29	7	When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and didst rend all their shoulders; and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	29	8	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and will cut off from thee man and beast.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	29	9	And the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. Because he hath said, The river is mine, and I have made it;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	29	10	therefore, behold, I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from the tower of Seveneh even unto the border of Ethiopia.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	29	11	No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	29	12	And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be a desolation forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse th	26
ASV	Ezekiel	29	13	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples whither they were scattered;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	29	14	and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their birth; and they shall be there a base kingdom.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	29	15	It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations: and I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	29	16	And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to remembrance, when they turn to look after them: and they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	29	17	And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	29	18	Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was worn; yet had he no wages, nor his army, from Tyre, for the service that he had served against it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	29	19	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall carry off her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	29	20	I have given him the land of Egypt as his recompense for which he served, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	29	21	In that day will I cause a horn to bud forth unto the house of Israel, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	1	The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	2	Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Wail ye, Alas for the day!	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	3	For the day is near, even the day of Jehovah is near; it shall be a day of clouds, a time of the nations.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	4	And a sword shall come upon Egypt, and anguish shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt; and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	5	Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mingled people, and Cub, and the children of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	6	Thus saith Jehovah: They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Seveneh shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	7	And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	8	And they shall know at I am Jehovah, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and all her helpers are destroyed.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	9	In that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid; and there shall be anguish upon them, as in the day of Egypt; for, lo, it cometh.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	10	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease, by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	11	He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	12	And I will make the rivers dry, and will sell the land into the hand of evil men; and I will make the land desolate, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I, Jehovah, have spoken it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	13	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause the images to cease from Memphis; and there shall be no more a prince from the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	14	And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments upon No.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	15	And I will pour my wrath upon Sin, the stronghold of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	16	And I will set a fire in Egypt: Sin shall be in great anguish, and No shall be broken up; and Memphis shall have adversaries in the day-time.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	17	The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword; and these cities shall go into captivity.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	18	At Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt, and the pride of her power shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	19	Thus will I execute judgments upon Egypt; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	20	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	21	Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it hath not been bound up, to apply healing medicines, to put a bandage to bind it, that it be strong to hold the sword.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	22	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong arm, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	23	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	24	And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	25	And I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon; and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	30	26	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	31	1	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	31	2	Son of man, say unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude: Whom art thou like in thy greatness?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	31	3	Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a forest-like shade, and of high stature; and its top was among the thick boughs.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	31	4	The waters nourished it, the deep made it to grow: the rivers thereof ran round about its plantation; and it sent out its channels unto all the trees of the field.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	31	5	Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field; and its boughs were multiplied, and its branches became long by reason of many waters, when it shot them forth.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	31	6	All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs; and under its branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young; and under its shadow dwelt all great nations.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	31	7	Thus was it fair in its greatness, in the length of its branches; for its root was by many waters.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	31	8	The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it; the fir-trees were not like its boughs, and the plane-trees were not as its branches; nor was any tree in the garden of God like unto it in its beauty.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	31	9	I made it fair by the multitude of its branches, so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	31	10	Therefore thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because thou art exalted in stature, and he hath set his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	31	11	I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations; he shall surely deal with him; I have driven him out for his wickedness.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	31	12	And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land; and all the peoples of the earth are gone do	26
ASV	Ezekiel	31	13	Upon his ruin all the birds of the heavens shall dwell, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	31	14	to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, neither set their top among the thick boughs, nor that their mighty ones stand up on their height, even all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to	26
ASV	Ezekiel	31	15	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day when he went down to Sheol I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the rivers thereof; and the great waters were stayed; and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the fiel	26
ASV	Ezekiel	31	16	I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to Sheol with them that descend into the pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the nether parts of the earth.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	31	17	They also went down into Sheol with him unto them that are slain by the sword; yea, they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the nations.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	31	18	To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	1	And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	2	Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou wast likened unto a young lion of the nations: yet art thou as a monster in the seas; and thou didst break forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	3	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will spread out my net upon thee with a company of many peoples; and they shall bring thee up in my net.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	4	And I will leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the birds of the heavens to settle upon thee, and I will satisfy the beasts of the whole earth with thee.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	5	And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	6	I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the mountains; and the watercourses shall be full of thee.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	7	And when I shall extinguish thee, I will cover the heavens, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give its light.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	8	All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	9	I will also vex the hearts of many peoples, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	10	Yea, I will make many peoples amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	11	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	12	By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall; the terrible of the nations are they all: and they shall bring to nought the pride of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	13	I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside many waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	14	Then will I make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	15	When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, a land destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	16	This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament; the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith; over Egypt, and over all her multitude, shall they lament therewith, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	17	It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	18	Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	19	Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	20	They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword: she is delivered to the sword; draw her away and all her multitudes.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	21	The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of Sheol with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie still, even the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	22	Asshur is there and all her company; her graves are round about her; all of them slain, fallen by the sword;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	23	whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit, and her company is round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	24	There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame with them	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	25	They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude; her graves are round about her; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for their terror was caused in the land of the living, and they have borne their shame with them that	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	26	There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude; their graves are round about them; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for they caused their terror in the land of the living.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	27	And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised, that are gone down to Sheol with their weapons of war, and have laid their swords under their heads, and their iniquities are upon their bones; for they were the terror of the mi	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	28	But thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with them that are slain by the sword.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	29	There is Edom, her kings and all her princes, who in their might are laid with them that are slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	30	There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who are gone down with the slain; in the terror which they caused by their might they are put to shame; and they lie uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword, and bear thei	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	31	Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	32	32	For I have put his terror in the land of the living; and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	1	And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	2	Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and set him for their watchman;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	3	if, when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	4	then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning, if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	5	He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him; whereas if he had taken warning, he would have delivered his soul.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	6	But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned, and the sword come, and take any person from among them; he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at the watchmans hand.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	7	So thou, son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	8	When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die, and thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way; that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thy hand.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	9	Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he turn not from his way; he shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	10	And thou, son of man, say unto the house of Israel: Thus ye speak, saying, Our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we pine away in them; how then can we live?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	11	Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	12	And thou, son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wic	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	13	When I say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his righteousness, and commit iniquity, none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered; but in his iniquity that he hath committed, therein shall he die.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	14	Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	15	if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that which he had taken by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	16	None of his sins that he hath committed shall be remembered against him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	17	Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	18	When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die therein.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	19	And when the wicked turneth from his wickedness, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	20	Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	21	And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	22	Now the hand of Jehovah had been upon me in the evening, before he that was escaped came; and he had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	23	And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	24	Son of man, they that inhabit those waste places in the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	25	Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes unto your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	26	Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbors wife: and shall ye possess the land?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	27	Thus shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely they that are in the waste places shall fall by the sword; and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured; and they that are in the strongholds and i	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	28	And I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment; and the pride of her power shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, so that none shall pass through.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	29	Then shall they know that I am Jehovah, when I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment, because of all their abominations which they have committed.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	30	And as for thee, son of man, the children of thy people talk of thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	31	And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but do them not; for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goeth after their gain.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	32	And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument; for they hear thy words, but they do them not.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	33	33	And when this cometh to pass, (behold, it cometh,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	1	And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	2	Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, even to the shepherds, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe unto the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the sheep?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	3	Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill the fatlings; but ye feed not the sheep.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	4	The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought back that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	5	And they were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and they became food to all the beasts of the field, and were scattered.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	6	My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my sheep were scattered upon all the face of the earth; and there was none that did search or seek after them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	7	Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	8	As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely forasmuch as my sheep became a prey, and my sheep became food to all the beasts of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my sheep, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	9	therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	10	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my sheep at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the sheep; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; and I will deliver my sheep from their mouth,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	11	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I myself, even I, will search for my sheep, and will seek them out.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	12	As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered abroad, so will I seek out my sheep; and I will deliver them out of all places whither they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	13	And I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them upon the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited places of the country.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	14	I will feed them with good pasture; and upon the mountains of the height of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie down in a good fold; and on fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	15	I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	16	I will seek that which was lost, and will bring back that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but the fat and the strong I will destroy; I will feed them in justice.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	17	And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, the rams and the he-goats.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	18	Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have fed upon the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture? and to have drunk of the clear waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	19	And as for my sheep, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet, and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	20	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto them: Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	21	Because ye thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	22	therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	23	And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	24	And I, Jehovah, will be their God, and my servant David prince among them; I, Jehovah, have spoken it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	25	And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land; and they shall dwell securely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	26	And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in its season; there shall be showers of blessing.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	27	And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase, and they shall be secure in their land; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have broken the bars of their yoke, and have delivered them out of the hand of t	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	28	And they shall no more be a prey to the nations, neither shall the beasts of the earth devour them; but they shall dwell securely, and none shall make them afraid.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	29	And I will raise up unto them a plantation for renown, and they shall be no more consumed with famine in the land, neither bear the shame of the nations any more.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	30	And they shall know that I, Jehovah, their God am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	34	31	And ye my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	35	1	Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	35	2	Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	35	3	and say unto it, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against thee, and I will make thee a desolation and an astonishment.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	35	4	I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	35	5	Because thou hast had a perpetual enmity, and hast given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	35	6	therefore, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: since thou hast not hated blood, therefore blood shall pursue thee.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	35	7	Thus will I make mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation; and I will cut off from it him that passeth through and him that returneth.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	35	8	And I will fill its mountains with its slain: in thy hills and in thy valleys and in all thy watercourses shall they fall that are slain with the sword.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	35	9	I will make thee a perpetual desolation, and thy cities shall not be inhabited; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	35	10	Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas Jehovah was there:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	35	11	therefore, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast showed out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I shall judge thee.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	35	12	And thou shalt know that I, Jehovah, have heard all thy revilings which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to devour.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	35	13	And ye have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	35	14	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	35	15	As thou didst rejoice over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Edom, even all of it; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	1	And thou, son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	2	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because the enemy hath said against you, Aha! and, The ancient high places are ours in possession;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	3	therefore prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because, even because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the nations, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	4	therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which are become a pre	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	5	therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the nations, and against all Edom, that have appointed my land unto themselves for a possession with the joy of all their heart, with despite of	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	6	Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath, because ye have borne the shame of th	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	7	therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I have sworn, saying, Surely the nations that are round about you, they shall bear their shame.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	8	But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people Israel; for they are at hand to come.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	9	For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn into you, and ye shall be tilled and sown;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	10	and I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	11	and I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited after your former estate, and will do better unto you than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	12	Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of children.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	13	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because they say unto you, Thou land art a devourer of men, and hast been a bereaver of thy nation;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	14	therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nation any more, saith the Lord Jehovah;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	15	neither will I let thee hear any more the shame of the nations, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the peoples any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nation to stumble any more, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	16	Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	17	Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings: their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	18	Wherefore I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood which they had poured out upon the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	19	and I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	20	And when they came unto the nations, whither they went, they profaned my holy name; in that men said of them, These are the people of Jehovah, and are gone forth out of his land.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	21	But I had regard for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations, whither they went.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	22	Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I do not this for your sake, O house of Israel, but for my holy name, which ye have profaned among the nations, whither ye went.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	23	And I will sanctify my great name, which hath been profaned among the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, saith the Lord Jehovah, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	24	For I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	25	And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	26	A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	27	And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep mine ordinances, and do them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	28	And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	29	And I will save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the grain, and will multiply it, and lay no famine upon you.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	30	And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	31	Then shall ye remember your evil ways, and your doings that were not good; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	32	Nor for your sake do I this, saith the Lord Jehovah, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	33	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	34	And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all that passed by.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	35	And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	36	Then the nations that are left round about you shall know that I, Jehovah, have builded the ruined places, and planted that which was desolate: I, Jehovah, have spoken it, and I will do it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	37	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: For this, moreover, will I be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them: I will increase them with men like a flock.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	36	38	As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	1	The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of Jehovah, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	2	And he caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	3	And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord Jehovah, thou knowest.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	4	Again he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	5	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	6	And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	7	So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and, behold, an earthquake; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	8	And I beheld, and, lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	9	Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	10	So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	11	Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	12	Therefore prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	13	And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, O my people.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	14	And I will put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place you in your own land: and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it and performed it, saith Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	15	The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	16	And thou, son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	17	and join them for thee one to another into one stick, that they may become one in thy hand.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	18	And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not show us what thou meanest by these?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	19	say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they sha	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	20	And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	21	And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, whither they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	22	and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all; and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	23	neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they b	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	24	And my servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in mine ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	25	And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their childrens children, for ever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	26	Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	27	My tabernacle also shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	37	28	And the nations shall know that I am Jehovah that sanctifieth Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	38	1	And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	38	2	Son of man, set thy face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	38	3	and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	38	4	and I will turn thee about, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in full armor, a great company with buckler and shield, all of them handling swords;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	38	5	Persia, Cush, and Put with them, all of them with shield and helmet;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	38	6	Gomer, and all his hordes; the house of Togarmah in the uttermost parts of the north, and all his hordes; even many peoples with thee.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	38	7	Be thou prepared, yea, prepare thyself, thou, and all thy companies that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	38	8	After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, that is gathered out of many peoples, upon the mountains of Israel, which have been a continual waste; but it is brought forth ou	26
ASV	Ezekiel	38	9	And thou shalt ascend, thou shalt come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy hordes, and many peoples with thee.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	38	10	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: It shall come to pass in that day, that things shall come into thy mind, and thou shalt devise an evil device:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	38	11	and thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	38	12	to take the spoil and to take the prey; to turn thy hand against the waste places that are now inhabited, and against the people that are gathered out of the nations, that have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the middle of the earth.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	38	13	Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take the spoil? hast thou assembled thy company to take the prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to tak	26
ASV	Ezekiel	38	14	Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In that day when my people Israel dwelleth securely, shalt thou not know it?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	38	15	And thou shalt come from thy place out of the uttermost parts of the north, thou, and many peoples with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company and a mighty army;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	38	16	and thou shalt come up against my people Israel, as a cloud to cover the land: it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring thee against my land, that the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	38	17	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Art thou he of whom I spake in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, that prophesied in those days for many years that I would bring thee against them?	26
ASV	Ezekiel	38	18	And it shall come to pass in that day, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah, that my wrath shall come up into my nostrils.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	38	19	For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	38	20	so that the fishes of the sea, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown	26
ASV	Ezekiel	38	21	And I will call for a sword against him unto all my mountains, saith the Lord Jehovah: every mans sword shall be against his brother.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	38	22	And with pestilence and with blood will I enter into judgment with him; and I will rain upon him, and upon his hordes, and upon the many peoples that are with him, an overflowing shower, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	38	23	And I will magnify myself, and sanctify myself, and I will make myself known in the eyes of many nations; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	1	And thou, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	2	and I will turn thee about, and will lead thee on, and will cause thee to come up from the uttermost parts of the north; and I will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	3	and I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	4	Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy hordes, and the peoples that are with thee: I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	5	Thou shalt fall upon the open field; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	6	And I will send a fire on Magog, and on them that dwell securely in the isles; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	7	And my holy name will I make known in the midst of my people Israel; neither will I suffer my holy name to be profaned any more: and the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, the Holy One in Israel.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	8	Behold, it cometh, and it shall be done, saith the Lord Jehovah; this is the day whereof I have spoken.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	9	And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall make fires of the weapons and burn them, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall make fires of them seven years;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	10	so that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall make fires of the weapons; and they shall plunder those that plundered them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	11	And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place for burial in Israel, the valley of them that pass through on the east of the sea; and it shall stop them that pass through: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude; and	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	12	And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying them, that they may cleanse the land.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	13	Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown in the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	14	And they shall set apart men of continual employment, that shall pass through the land, and, with them that pass through, those that bury them that remain upon the face of the land, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	15	And they that pass through the land shall pass through; and when any seeth a mans bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	16	And Hamonah shall also be the name of a city. Thus shall they cleanse the land.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	17	And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Speak unto the birds of every sort, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	18	Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	19	And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	20	And ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	21	And I will set my glory among the nations; and all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	22	So the house of Israel shall know that I am Jehovah their God, from that day and forward.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	23	And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity; because they trespassed against me, and I hid my face from them: so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they fell all of them by the sword.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	24	According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions did I unto them; and I hid my face from them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	25	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Now will I bring back the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel; and I will be jealous for my holy name.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	26	And they shall bear their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they shall dwell securely in their land, and none shall make them afraid;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	27	when I have brought them back from the peoples, and gathered them out of their enemies lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	28	And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, in that I caused them to go into captivity among the nations, and have gathered them unto their own land; and I will leave none of them any more there;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	39	29	neither will I hide my face any more from them; for I have poured out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	1	In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day, the hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me thither.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	2	In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain, whereon was as it were the frame of a city on the south.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	3	And he brought me thither; and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	4	And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee; for, to the intent that I may show them unto thee, art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	5	And, behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the mans hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a handbreadth each: so he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	6	Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the steps thereof: and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad; and the other threshold, one reed broad.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	7	And every lodge was one reed long, and one reed broad; and the space between the lodges was five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	8	He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	9	Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	10	And the lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	11	And he measured the breadth of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	12	and a border before the lodges, one cubit on this side, and a border, one cubit on that side; and the lodges, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	13	And he measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other, a breadth of five and twenty cubits; door against door.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	14	He made also posts, threescore cubits; and the court reached unto the posts, round about the gate.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	15	And from the forefront of the gate at the entrance unto the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	16	And there were closed windows to the lodges, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches; and windows were round about inward; and upon each post were palm-trees.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	17	Then brought he me into the outer court; and, lo, there were chambers and a pavement, made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	18	And the pavement was by the side of the gates, answerable unto the length of the gates, even the lower pavement.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	19	Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, a hundred cubits, both on the east and on the north.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	20	And the gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north, he measured the length thereof and the breadth thereof.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	21	And the lodges thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	22	And the windows thereof, and the arches thereof, and the palm-trees thereof, were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	23	And there was a gate to the inner court over against the other gate, both on the north and on the east; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	24	And he led me toward the south; and, behold, a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	25	And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	26	And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them; and it had palm-trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	27	And there was a gate to the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	28	Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	29	and the lodges thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	30	And there were arches round about, five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	31	And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof: and the ascent to it had eight steps.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	32	And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	33	and the lodges thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	34	And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	35	And he brought me to the north gate: and he measured it according to these measures;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	36	the lodges thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof: and there were windows therein round about; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	37	And the posts thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	38	And a chamber with the door thereof was by the posts at the gates; there they washed the burnt-offering.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	39	And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	40	And on the one side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	41	Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew the sacrifices.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	42	And there were four tables for the burnt-offering, of hewn stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; whereupon they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	43	And the hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened within round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the oblation.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	44	And without the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	45	And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	46	and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to Jehovah to minister unto him.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	47	And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was before the house.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	48	Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	40	49	The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; even by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	1	And he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	2	And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	3	Then went he inward, and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the breadth of the entrance, seven cubits.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	4	And he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	5	Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side-chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	6	And the side-chambers were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side-chambers round about, that they might have hold therein, and not have hold in the wall of the house	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	7	And the side-chambers were broader as they encompassed the house higher and higher; for the encompassing of the house went higher and higher round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house continued upward; and so one went up from the lowest cha	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	8	I saw also that the house had a raised basement round about: the foundations of the side-chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	9	The thickness of the wall, which was for the side-chambers, on the outside, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side-chambers that belonged to the house.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	10	And between the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	11	And the doors of the side-chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	12	And the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	13	So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, a hundred cubits long;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	14	also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	15	And he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at the back thereof, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits; and the inner temple, and the porches of the court;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	16	the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the threshold, ceiled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered),	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	17	to the space above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	18	And it was made with cherubim and palm-trees; and a palm-tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	19	so that there was the face of a man toward the palm-tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm-tree on the other side. thus was it made through all the house round about:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	20	from the ground unto above the door were cherubim and palm-trees made: thus was the wall of the temple.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	21	As for the temple, the door-posts were squared; and as for the face of the sanctuary, the appearance thereof was as the appearance of the temple.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	22	The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	23	And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	24	And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves: two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	25	And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm-trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there was a threshold of wood upon the face of the porch without.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	41	26	And there were closed windows and palm-trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch: thus were the side-chambers of the house, and the thresholds.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	42	1	Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was over against the building toward the north.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	42	2	Before the length of a hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	42	3	Over against the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court, and over against the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in the third story.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	42	4	And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	42	5	Now the upper chambers were shorter; for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middlemost, in the building.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	42	6	For they were in three stories, and they had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the uppermost was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	42	7	And the wall that was without by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court before the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	42	8	For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were a hundred cubits.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	42	9	And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the outer court.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	42	10	In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there were chambers.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	42	11	And the way before them was like the appearance of the way of the chambers which were toward the north; according to their length so was their breadth: and all their egresses were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	42	12	And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	42	13	Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they are the holy chambers, where the priests that are near unto Jehovah shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and t	26
ASV	Ezekiel	42	14	When the priests enter in, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and shall approach to that which pertaine	26
ASV	Ezekiel	42	15	Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	42	16	He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	42	17	He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	42	18	He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	42	19	He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	42	20	He measured it on the four sides: it had a wall round about, the length five hundred, and the breadth five hundred, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	1	Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	2	And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shined with his glory.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	3	And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	4	And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	5	And the Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	6	And I heard one speaking unto me out of the house; and a man stood by me.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	7	And he said unto me, Son of man, this is the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever. And the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neither they, nor their	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	8	in their setting of their threshold by my threshold, and their door-post beside my door-post, and there was but the wall between me and them; and they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed: wherefore I have consumed the	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	9	Now let them put away their whoredom, and the dead bodies of their kings, far from me; and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	10	Thou, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	11	And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, make known unto them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the egresses thereof, and the entrances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms there	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	12	This is the law of the house: upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	13	And these are the measures of the altar by cubits (the cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth): the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about a span; and this shall be the base of the altar.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	14	And from the bottom upon the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits, and the breadth a cubit.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	15	And the upper altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	16	And the altar hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve broad, square in the four sides thereof.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	17	And the ledge shall be fourteen cubits long by fourteen broad in the four sides thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit round about; and the steps thereof shall look toward the east.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	18	And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	19	Thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that are of the seed of Zadok, who are near unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord Jehovah, a young bullock for a sin-offering.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	20	And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the ledge, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse it and make atonement for it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	21	Thou shalt also take the bullock of the sin-offering, and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	22	And on the second day thou shalt offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin-offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	23	When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	24	And thou shalt bring them near before Jehovah, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	25	Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin-offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	26	Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it; so shall they consecrate it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	43	27	And when they have accomplished the days, it shall be that upon the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt-offerings upon the altar, and your peace-offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	1	Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	2	And Jehovah said unto me, This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, neither shall any man enter in by it; for Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it; therefore it shall be shut.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	3	As for the prince, he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread before Jehovah; he shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	4	Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah: and I fell upon my face.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	5	And Jehovah said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of Jehovah, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entrance of the house, with e	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	6	And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	7	in that ye have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant, to add unto all your abominatio	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	8	And ye have not kept the charge of my holy things; but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	9	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any foreigners that are among the children of Israel.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	10	But the Levites that went far from me, when Israel went astray, that went astray from me after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	11	Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house: they shall slay the burnt-offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	12	Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and became a stumblingblock of iniquity unto the house of Israel; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord Jehovah, and they shall bear their iniquity.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	13	And they shall not come near unto me, to execute the office of priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, unto the things that are most holy; but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	14	Yet will I make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	15	But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me; and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, sa	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	16	they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	17	And it shall be that, when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	18	They shall have linen tires upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with anything that causeth sweat.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	19	And when they go forth into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they minister, and lay them in the holy chambers; and they shall put on other garments, that they sanctify not the people with	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	20	Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only cut off the hair of their heads.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	21	Neither shall any of the priests drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	22	Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away; but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that is the widow of a priest.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	23	And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	24	And in a controversy they shall stand to judge; according to mine ordinances shall they judge it: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	25	And they shall go in to no dead person to defile themselves; but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	26	And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	27	And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin-offering, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	28	And they shall have an inheritance: I am their inheritance; and ye shall give them no possession in Israel; I am their possession.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	29	They shall eat the meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	30	And the first of all the first-fruits of every thing, and every oblation of everything, of all your oblations, shall be for the priest: ye shall also give unto the priests the first of your dough, to cause a blessing to rest on thy house.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	44	31	The priests shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself, or is torn, whether it be bird or beast.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	1	Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto Jehovah, a holy portion of the land; the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand: it shall be holy	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	2	Of this there shall be for the holy place five hundred in length by five hundred in breadth, square round about; and fifty cubits for the suburbs thereof round about.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	3	And of this measure shalt thou measure a length of five and twenty thousand, and a breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary, which is most holy.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	4	It is a holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, that come near to minister unto Jehovah; and it shall be a place for their houses, and a holy place for the sanctuary.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	5	And five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth, shall be unto the Levites, the ministers of the house, for a possession unto themselves, for twenty chambers.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	6	And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, side by side with the oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	7	And whatsoever is for the prince shall be on the one side and on the other side of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city, in front of the holy oblation and in front of the possession of the city, on the west side westward, and on the east si	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	8	In the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	9	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute justice and righteousness; take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	10	Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	11	The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of a homer, and the ephah the tenth part of a homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	12	And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	13	This is the oblation that ye shall offer: the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of wheat; and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of barley;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	14	and the set portion of oil, of the bath of oil, the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is ten baths, even a homer; (for ten baths are a homer;)	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	15	and one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well-watered pastures of Israel; -for a meal-offering, and for a burnt-offering, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement for them, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	16	All the people of the land shall give unto this oblation for the prince in Israel.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	17	And it shall be the princes part to give the burnt-offerings, and the meal-offerings, and the drink-offerings, in the feasts, and on the new moons, and on the sabbaths, in all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin-offering,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	18	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the first month, in the first day of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish; and thou shalt cleanse the sanctuary.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	19	And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering, and put it upon the door-posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	20	And so thou shalt do on the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye make atonement for the house.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	21	In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	22	And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin-offering.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	23	And the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt-offering to Jehovah, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a he-goat daily for a sin-offering.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	24	And he shall prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil to an ephah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	45	25	In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, in the feast, shall he do the like the seven days; according to the sin-offering, according to the burnt-offering, and according to the meal-offering, and according to the oil.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	1	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath day it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	2	And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate; and the priests shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	3	And the people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before Jehovah on the sabbaths and on the new moons.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	4	And the burnt-offering that the prince shall offer unto Jehovah shall be on the sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	5	and the meal-offering shall be an ephah for the ram, and the meal-offering for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	6	And on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram; they shall be without blemish:	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	7	and he shall prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for the bullock, and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according as he is able, and a hin of oil to an ephah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	8	And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	9	But when the people of the land shall come before Jehovah in the appointed feasts, he that entereth by the way of the north gate to worship shall go forth by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by th	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	10	And the prince, when they go in, shall go in in the midst of them; and when they go forth, they shall go forth together.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	11	And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meal-offering shall be an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	12	And when the prince shall prepare a freewill-offering, a burnt-offering or peace-offerings as a freewill-offering unto Jehovah, one shall open for him the gate that looketh toward the east; and he shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	13	And thou shalt prepare a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah daily: morning by morning shalt thou prepare it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	14	And thou shalt prepare a meal-offering with it morning by morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil, to moisten the fine flour; a meal-offering unto Jehovah continually by a perpetual ordinance.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	15	Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meal-offering, and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt-offering.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	16	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, it is his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	17	But if he give of his inheritance a gift to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it shall be for his sons.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	18	Moreover the prince shall not take of the peoples inheritance, to thrust them out of their possession; he shall give inheritance to his sons out of his own possession, that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	19	Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the hinder part westward.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	20	And he said unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass-offering and the sin-offering, and where they shall bake the meal-offering; that they bring them not forth into the outer court, to sanctify the people.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	21	Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	22	In the four corners of the court there were courts inclosed, forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four in the corners were of one measure.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	23	And there was a wall round about in them, round about the four, and boiling-places were made under the walls round about.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	46	24	Then said he unto me, These are the boiling-houses, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	47	1	And he brought me back unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward; (for the forefront of the house was toward the east;) and the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house,	26
ASV	Ezekiel	47	2	Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me round by the way without unto the outer gate, by the way of the gate that looketh toward the east; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	47	3	When the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	47	4	Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the loins.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	47	5	Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass through; for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	47	6	And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	47	7	Now when I had returned, behold, upon the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	47	8	Then said he unto me, These waters issue forth toward the eastern region, and shall go down into the Arabah; and they shall go toward the sea; into the sea shall the waters go which were made to issue forth; and the waters shall be healed.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	47	9	And it shall come to pass, that every living creature which swarmeth, in every place whither the rivers come, shall live; and there shall be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters are come thither, and the waters of the sea shall be healed, and	26
ASV	Ezekiel	47	10	And it shall come to pass, that fishers shall stand by it: from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim shall be a place for the spreading of nets; their fish shall be after their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	47	11	But the miry places thereof, and the marshes thereof, shall not be healed; they shall be given up to salt.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	47	12	And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not whither, neither shall the fruit thereof fail: it shall bring forth new fruit every month, because the waters thereof issue out of	26
ASV	Ezekiel	47	13	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This shall be the border, whereby ye shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	47	14	And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another; for I sware to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	47	15	And this shall be the border of the land: On the north side, from the great sea, by the way of Hethlon, unto the entrance of Zedad;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	47	16	Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer-hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	47	17	And the border from the sea, shall be Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus; and on the north northward is the border of Hamath. This is the north side.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	47	18	And the east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead, and the land of Israel, shall be the Jordan; from the north border unto the east sea shall ye measure. This is the east side.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	47	19	And the south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth-kadesh, to the brook of Egypt, unto the great sea. This is the south side southward.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	47	20	And the west side shall be the great sea, from the south border as far as over against the entrance of Hamath. This is the west side.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	47	21	So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	47	22	And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you and to the strangers that sojourn among you, who shall beget children among you; and they shall be unto you as the home-born among the children of Israel; they shall hav	26
ASV	Ezekiel	47	23	And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	1	Now these are the names of the tribes: From the north end, beside the way of Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath, Hazar-enan at the border of Damascus, northward beside Hamath, (and they shall have their sides east and west,) Dan, one portion.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	2	And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, Asher, one portion.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	3	And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west side, Naphtali, one portion.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	4	And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the west side, Manasseh, one portion.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	5	And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the west side, Ephraim, one portion.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	6	And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the west side, Reuben, one portion.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	7	And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west side, Judah, one portion.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	8	And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west side, shall be the oblation which ye shall offer, five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the portions, from the east side unto the west side: and the sanctuary shall	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	9	The oblation that ye shall offer unto Jehovah shall be five and twenty thousand reeds in length, and ten thousand in breadth.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	10	And for these, even for the priests, shall be the holy oblation: toward the north five and twenty thousand in length, and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and twenty thousand i	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	11	It shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok, that have kept my charge, that went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	12	And it shall be unto them an oblation from the oblation of the land, a thing most holy, by the border of the Levites.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	13	And answerable unto the border of the priests, the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth: all the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	14	And they shall sell none of it, nor exchange it, nor shall the first-fruits of the land be alienated; for it is holy unto Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	15	And the five thousand that are left in the breadth, in front of the five and twenty thousand, shall be for common use, for the city, for dwelling and for suburbs; and the city shall be in the midst thereof.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	16	And these shall be the measures thereof: the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	17	And the city shall have suburbs: toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	18	And the residue in the length, answerable unto the holy oblation, shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward; and it shall be answerable unto the holy oblation; and the increase thereof shall be for food unto them that labor in the city.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	19	And they that labor in the city, out of all the tribes of Israel, shall till it.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	20	All the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblation four-square, with the possession of the city.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	21	And the residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city; in front of the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the east border, and westward in front of the five and twenty	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	22	Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, being in the midst of that which is the princes, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, it shall be for the prince.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	23	And as for the rest of the tribes: from the east side unto the west side, Benjamin, one portion.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	24	And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the west side, Simeon, one portion.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	25	And by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the west side, Issachar, one portion.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	26	And by the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the west side, Zebulun, one portion.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	27	And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west side, Gad, one portion.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	28	And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar unto the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the brook of Egypt, unto the great sea.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	29	This is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these are their several portions, saith the Lord Jehovah.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	30	And these are the egresses of the city: On the north side four thousand and five hundred reeds by measure;	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	31	and the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel, three gates northward: the gate of Reuben, one; the gate of Judah, one; the gate of Levi, one.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	32	And at the east side four thousand and five hundred reeds, and three gates: even the gate of Joseph, one; the gate of Benjamin, one; the gate of Dan, one.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	33	And at the south side four thousand and five hundred reeds by measure, and three gates: the gate of Simeon, one; the gate of Issachar, one; the gate of Zebulun, one.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	34	At the west side four thousand and five hundred reeds, with their three gates: the gate of Gad, one; the gate of Asher, one; the gate of Naphtali, one.	26
ASV	Ezekiel	48	35	It shall be eighteen thousand reeds round about: and the name of the city from that day shall be, Jehovah is there.	26
ASV	Daniel	1	1	In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.	27
ASV	Daniel	1	2	And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god: and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.	27
ASV	Daniel	1	3	And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring in certain of the children of Israel, even of the seed royal and of the nobles;	27
ASV	Daniel	1	4	youths in whom was no blemish, but well-favored, and skilful in all wisdom, and endued with knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability to stand in the kings palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the tongue of the Chalde	27
ASV	Daniel	1	5	And the king appointed for them a daily portion of the kings dainties, and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at the end thereof they should stand before the king.	27
ASV	Daniel	1	6	Now among these were, of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.	27
ASV	Daniel	1	7	And the prince of the eunuchs gave names unto them: unto Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.	27
ASV	Daniel	1	8	But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the kings dainties, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.	27
ASV	Daniel	1	9	Now God made Daniel to find kindness and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs.	27
ASV	Daniel	1	10	And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your food and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse looking than the youths that are of your own age? so would ye endanger my head with the king.	27
ASV	Daniel	1	11	Then said Daniel to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:	27
ASV	Daniel	1	12	Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.	27
ASV	Daniel	1	13	Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the kings dainties; and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.	27
ASV	Daniel	1	14	So he hearkened unto them in this matter, and proved them ten days.	27
ASV	Daniel	1	15	And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer, and they were fatter in flesh, than all the youths that did eat of the kings dainties.	27
ASV	Daniel	1	16	So the steward took away their dainties, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse.	27
ASV	Daniel	1	17	Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.	27
ASV	Daniel	1	18	And at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in, the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.	27
ASV	Daniel	1	19	And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.	27
ASV	Daniel	1	20	And in every matter of wisdom and understanding, concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his realm.	27
ASV	Daniel	1	21	And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	1	And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep went from him.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	2	Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the enchanters, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	3	And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	4	Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in the Syrian language, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	5	The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye make not known unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	6	But if ye show the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me the dream and the interpretation thereof.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	7	They answered the second time and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	8	The king answered and said, I know of a certainty that ye would gain time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	9	But if ye make not known unto me the dream, there is but one law for you; for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation there	27
ASV	Daniel	2	10	The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can show the kings matter, forasmuch as no king, lord, or ruler, hath asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	11	And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is no other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	12	For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	13	So the decree went forth, and the wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	14	Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the kings guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon;	27
ASV	Daniel	2	15	he answered and said to Arioch the kings captain, Wherefore is the decree so urgent from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	16	And Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would show the king the interpretation.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	17	Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:	27
ASV	Daniel	2	18	that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should nor perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	19	Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	20	Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever; for wisdom and might are his.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	21	And he changeth the times and the seasons; he removeth kings, and setteth up kings; he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that have understanding;	27
ASV	Daniel	2	22	he revealeth the deep and secret things; he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	23	I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast now made known unto me what we desired of thee; for thou hast made known unto us the kings matter.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	24	Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show unto the king the interpretation.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	25	Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	26	The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?	27
ASV	Daniel	2	27	Daniel answered before the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor soothsayers, show unto the king;	27
ASV	Daniel	2	28	but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and he hath made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these:	27
ASV	Daniel	2	29	as for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and he that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what shall come to pass.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	30	But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	31	Thou, O king, sawest, and, behold, a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the aspect thereof was terrible.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	32	As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass,	27
ASV	Daniel	2	33	its legs of iron, its feet part of iron, and part of clay.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	34	Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon its feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them in pieces.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	35	Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image	27
ASV	Daniel	2	36	This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	37	Thou, O king, art king of kings, unto whom the God of heaven hath given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory;	27
ASV	Daniel	2	38	and wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens hath he given into thy hand, and hath made thee to rule over them all: thou art the head of gold.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	39	And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	40	And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things; and as iron that crusheth all these, shall it break in pieces and crush.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	41	And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	42	And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	43	And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	44	And in the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall the sovereignty thereof be left to another people; but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	45	Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the drea	27
ASV	Daniel	2	46	Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors unto him.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	47	The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou hast been able to reveal this secret.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	48	Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon.	27
ASV	Daniel	2	49	And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel was in the gate of the king.	27
ASV	Daniel	3	1	Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.	27
ASV	Daniel	3	2	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar	27
ASV	Daniel	3	3	Then the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they st	27
ASV	Daniel	3	4	Then the herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,	27
ASV	Daniel	3	5	that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up;	27
ASV	Daniel	3	6	and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.	27
ASV	Daniel	3	7	Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had	27
ASV	Daniel	3	8	Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews.	27
ASV	Daniel	3	9	They answered and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, O king, live for ever.	27
ASV	Daniel	3	10	Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image;	27
ASV	Daniel	3	11	and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.	27
ASV	Daniel	3	12	There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.	27
ASV	Daniel	3	13	Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these men before the king.	27
ASV	Daniel	3	14	Nebuchadnezzar answered and said unto them, Is it of purpose, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that ye serve not my god, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?	27
ASV	Daniel	3	15	Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made, well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour i	27
ASV	Daniel	3	16	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter.	27
ASV	Daniel	3	17	If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of thy hand, O king.	27
ASV	Daniel	3	18	But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.	27
ASV	Daniel	3	19	Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated.	27
ASV	Daniel	3	20	And he commanded certain mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.	27
ASV	Daniel	3	21	Then these men were bound in their hosen, their tunics, and their mantles, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.	27
ASV	Daniel	3	22	Therefore because the kings commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.	27
ASV	Daniel	3	23	And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.	27
ASV	Daniel	3	24	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste: he spake and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.	27
ASV	Daniel	3	25	He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of the gods.	27
ASV	Daniel	3	26	Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace: he spake and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth out of the midst	27
ASV	Daniel	3	27	And the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, and the kings counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their hosen changed, nor had the smell o	27
ASV	Daniel	3	28	Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the kings word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor w	27
ASV	Daniel	3	29	Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other god that is ab	27
ASV	Daniel	3	30	Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego in the province of Babylon.	27
ASV	Daniel	4	1	Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied unto you.	27
ASV	Daniel	4	2	It hath seemed good unto me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God hath wrought toward me.	27
ASV	Daniel	4	3	How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.	27
ASV	Daniel	4	4	I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace.	27
ASV	Daniel	4	5	I saw a dream which made me afraid; and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.	27
ASV	Daniel	4	6	Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.	27
ASV	Daniel	4	7	Then came in the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers; and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.	27
ASV	Daniel	4	8	But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and I told the dream before him, saying,	27
ASV	Daniel	4	9	O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.	27
ASV	Daniel	4	10	Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, and, behold, a tree in the midst of the earth; and the height thereof was great.	27
ASV	Daniel	4	11	The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.	27
ASV	Daniel	4	12	The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the birds of the heavens dwelt in the branches thereof, and all flesh was fed from it.	27
ASV	Daniel	4	13	I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven.	27
ASV	Daniel	4	14	He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches.	27
ASV	Daniel	4	15	Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven: and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:	27
ASV	Daniel	4	16	let his heart be changed from mans, and let a beasts heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.	27
ASV	Daniel	4	17	The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones; to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the lowest of m	27
ASV	Daniel	4	18	This dream I, king Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation; but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in	27
ASV	Daniel	4	19	Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stricken dumb for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king answered and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be	27
ASV	Daniel	4	20	The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;	27
ASV	Daniel	4	21	whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the birds of the heavens had their habitation:	27
ASV	Daniel	4	22	it is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong; for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.	27
ASV	Daniel	4	23	And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field,	27
ASV	Daniel	4	24	this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which is come upon my lord the king:	27
ASV	Daniel	4	25	that thou shalt be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen, and shalt be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee; till thou know that the Most High rulet	27
ASV	Daniel	4	26	And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.	27
ASV	Daniel	4	27	Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if there may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.	27
ASV	Daniel	4	28	All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.	27
ASV	Daniel	4	29	At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon.	27
ASV	Daniel	4	30	The king spake and said, Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling-place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?	27
ASV	Daniel	4	31	While the word was in the kings mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken: The kingdom is departed from thee:	27
ASV	Daniel	4	32	and thou shalt be driven from men; and they dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen; and seven times shall pass over thee; until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to wh	27
ASV	Daniel	4	33	The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair was grown like eagles feathers, and his nails like birds claws.	27
ASV	Daniel	4	34	And at the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored him that liveth for ever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his k	27
ASV	Daniel	4	35	And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?	27
ASV	Daniel	4	36	At the same time mine understanding returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added unto	27
ASV	Daniel	4	37	Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven; for all his works are truth, and his ways justice; and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.	27
ASV	Daniel	5	1	Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.	27
ASV	Daniel	5	2	Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, might drink therefrom.	27
ASV	Daniel	5	3	Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, drank from them.	27
ASV	Daniel	5	4	They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.	27
ASV	Daniel	5	5	In the same hour came forth the fingers of a mans hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the kings palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.	27
ASV	Daniel	5	6	Then the kings countenance was changed in him, and his thoughts troubled him; and the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.	27
ASV	Daniel	5	7	The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. The king spake and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and show me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with purple, and have a ch	27
ASV	Daniel	5	8	Then came in all the kings wise men; but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation.	27
ASV	Daniel	5	9	Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed.	27
ASV	Daniel	5	10	Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: the queen spake and said, O king, live forever; let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed.	27
ASV	Daniel	5	11	There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him; and the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, m	27
ASV	Daniel	5	12	forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of dark sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will sho	27
ASV	Daniel	5	13	Then was Daniel brought in before the king. The king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, who art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah?	27
ASV	Daniel	5	14	I have heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in thee.	27
ASV	Daniel	5	15	And now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof; but they could not show the interpretation of the thing.	27
ASV	Daniel	5	16	But I have heard of thee, that thou canst give interpretations, and dissolve doubts; now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt	27
ASV	Daniel	5	17	Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; nevertheless I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.	27
ASV	Daniel	5	18	O thou king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty:	27
ASV	Daniel	5	19	and because of the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he raised up, and whom he would he put down.	27
ASV	Daniel	5	20	But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:	27
ASV	Daniel	5	21	and he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; he was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; until he knew that the Most High God ruleth in the king	27
ASV	Daniel	5	22	And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thy heart, though thou knewest all this,	27
ASV	Daniel	5	23	but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy lords, thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine from them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold, of brass	27
ASV	Daniel	5	24	Then was the part of the hand sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed.	27
ASV	Daniel	5	25	And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.	27
ASV	Daniel	5	26	This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and brought it to an end;	27
ASV	Daniel	5	27	TEKEL; thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.	27
ASV	Daniel	5	28	PERES; thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.	27
ASV	Daniel	5	29	Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.	27
ASV	Daniel	5	30	In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean King was slain.	27
ASV	Daniel	5	31	And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.	27
ASV	Daniel	6	1	It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, who should be throughout the whole kingdom;	27
ASV	Daniel	6	2	and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these satraps might give account unto them, and that the king should have no damage.	27
ASV	Daniel	6	3	Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.	27
ASV	Daniel	6	4	Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault, forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.	27
ASV	Daniel	6	5	Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.	27
ASV	Daniel	6	6	Then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.	27
ASV	Daniel	6	7	All the presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the satraps, the counsellors and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a strong interdict, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days	27
ASV	Daniel	6	8	Now, O king, establish the interdict, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.	27
ASV	Daniel	6	9	Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the interdict.	27
ASV	Daniel	6	10	And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house (now his windows were open in his chamber toward Jerusalem) and he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.	27
ASV	Daniel	6	11	Then these men assembled together, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.	27
ASV	Daniel	6	12	Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the kings interdict: Hast thou not signed an interdict, that every man that shall make petition unto any god or man within thirty days, save unto thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?	27
ASV	Daniel	6	13	Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the interdict that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.	27
ASV	Daniel	6	14	Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored till the going down of the sun to rescue him.	27
ASV	Daniel	6	15	Then these men assembled together unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no interdict nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.	27
ASV	Daniel	6	16	Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.	27
ASV	Daniel	6	17	And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.	27
ASV	Daniel	6	18	Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep fled from him.	27
ASV	Daniel	6	19	Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.	27
ASV	Daniel	6	20	And when he came near unto the den to Daniel, he cried with a lamentable voice; the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?	27
ASV	Daniel	6	21	Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.	27
ASV	Daniel	6	22	My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions mouths, and they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.	27
ASV	Daniel	6	23	Then was the king exceeding glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he had trusted in his God.	27
ASV	Daniel	6	24	And the king commanded, and they brought those men that had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces, before they came to th	27
ASV	Daniel	6	25	Then king Darius wrote unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied unto you.	27
ASV	Daniel	6	26	I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, And his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed; and his dominion shall be even unto the end.	27
ASV	Daniel	6	27	He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.	27
ASV	Daniel	6	28	So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	1	In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	2	Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven brake forth upon the great sea.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	3	And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	4	The first was like a lion, and had eagles wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man; and a mans heart was given to it.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	5	And, behold, another beast, a second, like to a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	6	After this I beheld, and, lo, another, like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings of a bird; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	7	After this I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, a fourth beast, terrible and powerful, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the beasts	27
ASV	Daniel	7	8	I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	9	I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, and the wheels thereof burning fire.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	10	A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	11	I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake; I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	12	And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	13	I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	14	And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	15	As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	16	I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	17	These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that shall arise out of the earth.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	18	But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	19	Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;	27
ASV	Daniel	7	20	and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	21	I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;	27
ASV	Daniel	7	22	until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	23	Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	24	And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	25	And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	26	But the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	27	And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.	27
ASV	Daniel	7	28	Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance was changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	1	In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me, Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	2	And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	3	Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	4	I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	5	And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	6	And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	7	And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was non	27
ASV	Daniel	8	8	And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable horns toward the four winds of heaven.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	9	And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	10	And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	11	Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and it took away from him the continual burnt-offering, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	12	And the host was given over to it together with the continual burnt-offering through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it did its pleasure and prospered.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	13	Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one who spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the continual burnt-offering, and the transgression that maketh desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be tr	27
ASV	Daniel	8	14	And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	15	And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	16	And I heard a mans voice between the banks of the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	17	So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was affrighted, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	18	Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	19	And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	20	The ram which thou sawest, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	21	And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	22	And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	23	And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	24	And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do his pleasure; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	25	And through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in their security shall he destroy many: he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	26	And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true: but shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days to come.	27
ASV	Daniel	8	27	And I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the kings business: and I wondered at the vision, but none understood it.	27
ASV	Daniel	9	1	In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans,	27
ASV	Daniel	9	2	in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, understood by the books the number of the years whereof the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the prophet, for the accomplishing of the desolations of Jerusalem, even seventy years.	27
ASV	Daniel	9	3	And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.	27
ASV	Daniel	9	4	And I prayed unto Jehovah my God, and made confession, and said, Oh, Lord, the great and dreadful God, who keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments,	27
ASV	Daniel	9	5	we have sinned, and have dealt perversely, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even turning aside from thy precepts and from thine ordinances;	27
ASV	Daniel	9	6	neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, that spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.	27
ASV	Daniel	9	7	O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of face, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast drive	27
ASV	Daniel	9	8	O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.	27
ASV	Daniel	9	9	To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness; for we have rebelled against him;	27
ASV	Daniel	9	10	neither have we obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.	27
ASV	Daniel	9	11	Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even turning aside, that they should not obey thy voice: therefore hath the curse been poured out upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God; for we have sinned against him.	27
ASV	Daniel	9	12	And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil; for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.	27
ASV	Daniel	9	13	As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet have we not entreated the favor of Jehovah our God, that we should turn from our iniquities, and have discernment in thy truth.	27
ASV	Daniel	9	14	Therefore hath Jehovah watched over the evil, and brought it upon us; for Jehovah our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth, and we have not obeyed his voice.	27
ASV	Daniel	9	15	And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.	27
ASV	Daniel	9	16	O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, let thine anger and thy wrath, I pray thee, be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach	27
ASV	Daniel	9	17	Now therefore, O our God, hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lords sake.	27
ASV	Daniel	9	18	O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousness, but for thy great mercies sake.	27
ASV	Daniel	9	19	O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God, because thy city and thy people are called by thy name.	27
ASV	Daniel	9	20	And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God;	27
ASV	Daniel	9	21	yea, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.	27
ASV	Daniel	9	22	And he instructed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee wisdom and understanding.	27
ASV	Daniel	9	23	At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment went forth, and I am come to tell thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision.	27
ASV	Daniel	9	24	Seventy weeks are decreed upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint th	27
ASV	Daniel	9	25	Know therefore and discern, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the anointed one, the prince, shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: it shall be built again, with street and moat, even in troubl	27
ASV	Daniel	9	26	And after the threescore and two weeks shall the anointed one be cut off, and shall have nothing: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and even unto the end shall	27
ASV	Daniel	9	27	And he shall make a firm covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease; and upon the wing of abominations shall come one that maketh desolate; and even unto the full end, and that dete	27
ASV	Daniel	10	1	In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, even a great warfare: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.	27
ASV	Daniel	10	2	In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three whole weeks.	27
ASV	Daniel	10	3	I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.	27
ASV	Daniel	10	4	And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel,	27
ASV	Daniel	10	5	I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with pure gold of Uphaz:	27
ASV	Daniel	10	6	his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as flaming torches, and his arms and his feet like unto burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.	27
ASV	Daniel	10	7	And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves.	27
ASV	Daniel	10	8	So I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.	27
ASV	Daniel	10	9	Yet heard I the voice of his words; and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground.	27
ASV	Daniel	10	10	And, behold, a hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.	27
ASV	Daniel	10	11	And he said unto me, O Daniel, thou man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright; for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.	27
ASV	Daniel	10	12	Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard: and I am come for thy words sake.	27
ASV	Daniel	10	13	But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me: and I remained there with the kings of Persia.	27
ASV	Daniel	10	14	Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days; for the vision is yet for many days:	27
ASV	Daniel	10	15	and when he had spoken unto me according to these words, I set my face toward the ground, and was dumb.	27
ASV	Daniel	10	16	And, behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by reason of the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I retain no strength.	27
ASV	Daniel	10	17	For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither was there breath left in me.	27
ASV	Daniel	10	18	Then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me.	27
ASV	Daniel	10	19	And he said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he spake unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.	27
ASV	Daniel	10	20	Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I am come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I go forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come.	27
ASV	Daniel	10	21	But I will tell thee that which is inscribed in the writing of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me against these, but Michael your prince.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	1	And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	2	And now will I show thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and when he is waxed strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	3	And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	4	And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion wherewith he ruled; for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others besides these.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	5	And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	6	And at the end of years they shall join themselves together; and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the strength of her arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm; but she	27
ASV	Daniel	11	7	But out of a shoot from her roots shall one stand up in his place, who shall come unto the army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	8	And also their gods, with their molten images, and with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold, shall he carry captive into Egypt; and he shall refrain some years from the king of the north.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	9	And he shall come into the realm of the king of the south, but he shall return into his own land.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	10	And his sons shall war, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces, which shall come on, and overflow, and pass through; and they shall return and war, even to his fortress.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	11	And the king of the south shall be moved with anger, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north; and he shall set forth a great multitude, and the multitude shall be given into his hand.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	12	And the multitude shall be lifted up, and his heart shall be exalted; and he shall cast down tens of thousands, but he shall not prevail.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	13	And the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former; and he shall come on at the end of the times, even of years, with a great army and with much substance.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	14	And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the children of the violent among thy people shall lift themselves up to establish the vision; but they shall fall.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	15	So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mound, and take a well-fortified city: and the forces of the south shall not stand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to stand.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	16	But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him; and he shall stand in the glorious land, and in his hand shall be destruction.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	17	And he shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and with him equitable conditions; and he shall perform them: and he shall give him the daughter of women, to corrupt her; but she shall not stand, neither be for him.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	18	After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; yea, moreover, he shall cause his reproach to turn upon him.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	19	Then he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land; but he shall stumble and fall, and shall not be found.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	20	Then shall stand up in his place one that shall cause an exactor to pass through the glory of the kingdom; but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	21	And in his place shall stand up a contemptible person, to whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom: but he shall come in time of security, and shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	22	And the overwhelming forces shall be overwhelmed from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	23	And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully; for he shall come up, and shall become strong, with a small people.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	24	In time of security shall he come even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers fathers; he shall scatter among them prey, and spoil, and substance: yea, he shall devise his devices aga	27
ASV	Daniel	11	25	And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall war in battle with an exceeding great and mighty army; but he shall not stand; for they shall devise devices against him.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	26	Yea, they that eat of his dainties shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow; and many shall fall down slain.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	27	And as for both these kings, their hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table: but it shall not prosper; for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	28	Then shall he return into his land with great substance; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do his pleasure, and return to his own land.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	29	At the time appointed he shall return, and come into the south; but it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	30	For ships of Kittim shall come against him; therefore he shall be grieved, and shall return, and have indignation against the holy covenant, and shall do his pleasure: he shall even return, and have regard unto them that forsake the holy covenant.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	31	And forces shall stand on his part, and they shall profane the sanctuary, even the fortress, and shall take away the continual burnt-offering, and they shall set up the abomination that maketh desolate.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	32	And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he pervert by flatteries; but the people that know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	33	And they that are wise among the people shall instruct many; yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by spoil, many days.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	34	Now when they shall fall, they shall be helped with a little help; but many shall join themselves unto them with flatteries.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	35	And some of them that are wise shall fall, to refine them, and to purify, and to make them white, even to the time of the end; because it is yet for the time appointed.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	36	And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods; and he shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished; for that which is determine	27
ASV	Daniel	11	37	Neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god; for he shall magnify himself above all.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	38	But in his place shall he honor the god of fortresses; and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	39	And he shall deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god: whosoever acknowledgeth him he will increase with glory; and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for a price.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	40	And at the time of the end shall the king of the south contend with him; and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow an	27
ASV	Daniel	11	41	He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown; but these shall be delivered out of his hand: Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	42	He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries; and the land of Egypt shall not escape.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	43	But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	44	But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him; and he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many.	27
ASV	Daniel	11	45	And he shall plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.	27
ASV	Daniel	12	1	And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince who standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered,	27
ASV	Daniel	12	2	And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.	27
ASV	Daniel	12	3	And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.	27
ASV	Daniel	12	4	But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.	27
ASV	Daniel	12	5	Then I, Daniel, looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on the brink of the river on this side, and the other on the brink of the river on that side.	27
ASV	Daniel	12	6	And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?	27
ASV	Daniel	12	7	And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and a half; and when they have made an end	27
ASV	Daniel	12	8	And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my lord, what shall be the issue of these things?	27
ASV	Daniel	12	9	And he said, Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are shut up and sealed till the time of the end.	27
ASV	Daniel	12	10	Many shall purify themselves, and make themselves white, and be refined; but the wicked shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked shall understand; but they that are wise shall understand.	27
ASV	Daniel	12	11	And from the time that the continual burnt-offering shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand and two hundred and ninety days.	27
ASV	Daniel	12	12	Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.	27
ASV	Daniel	12	13	But go thou thy way till the end be; for thou shalt rest, and shalt stand in thy lot, at the end of the days.	27
ASV	Hosea	1	1	The word of Jehovah that came unto Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.	28
ASV	Hosea	1	2	When Jehovah spake at the first by Hosea, Jehovah said unto Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredom and children of whoredom; for the land doth commit great whoredom, departing from Jehovah.	28
ASV	Hosea	1	3	So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bare him a son.	28
ASV	Hosea	1	4	And Jehovah said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.	28
ASV	Hosea	1	5	And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.	28
ASV	Hosea	1	6	And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And Jehovah said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah; for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel, that I should in any wise pardon them.	28
ASV	Hosea	1	7	But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by Jehovah their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.	28
ASV	Hosea	1	8	Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.	28
ASV	Hosea	1	9	And Jehovah said, Call his name Lo-ammi; for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God.	28
ASV	Hosea	1	10	Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass that, in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of	28
ASV	Hosea	1	11	And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall go up from the land; for great shall be the day of Jezreel.	28
ASV	Hosea	2	1	Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.	28
ASV	Hosea	2	2	Contend with your mother, contend; for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband; and let her put away her whoredoms from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts;	28
ASV	Hosea	2	3	lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.	28
ASV	Hosea	2	4	Yea, upon her children will I have no mercy; for they are children of whoredom;	28
ASV	Hosea	2	5	for their mother hath played the harlot; she that conceived them hath done shamefully; for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.	28
ASV	Hosea	2	6	Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will build a wall against her, that she shall not find her paths.	28
ASV	Hosea	2	7	And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.	28
ASV	Hosea	2	8	For she did not know that I gave her the grain, and the new wine, and the oil, and multiplied unto her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.	28
ASV	Hosea	2	9	Therefore will I take back my grain in the time thereof, and my new wine in the season thereof, and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness.	28
ASV	Hosea	2	10	And now will I uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand.	28
ASV	Hosea	2	11	I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.	28
ASV	Hosea	2	12	And I will lay waste her vines and her fig-trees, whereof she hath said, These are my hire that my lovers have given me; and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.	28
ASV	Hosea	2	13	And I will visit upon her the days of the Baalim, unto which she burned incense, when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith Jehovah.	28
ASV	Hosea	2	14	Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.	28
ASV	Hosea	2	15	And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she shall make answer there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.	28
ASV	Hosea	2	16	And it shall be at that day, saith Jehovah, that thou shalt call me Ishi, and shalt call me no more Baali.	28
ASV	Hosea	2	17	For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be mentioned by their name.	28
ASV	Hosea	2	18	And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heavens, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, and will make them to lie d	28
ASV	Hosea	2	19	And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in justice, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.	28
ASV	Hosea	2	20	I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness; and thou shalt know Jehovah.	28
ASV	Hosea	2	21	And it shall come to pass in that day, I will answer, saith Jehovah, I will answer the heavens, and they shall answer the earth;	28
ASV	Hosea	2	22	and the earth shall answer the grain, and the new wine, and the oil; and they shall answer Jezreel.	28
ASV	Hosea	2	23	And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them that were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.	28
ASV	Hosea	3	1	And Jehovah said unto me, Go again, love a woman beloved of her friend, and an adulteress, even as Jehovah loveth the children of Israel, though they turn unto other gods, and love cakes of raisins.	28
ASV	Hosea	3	2	So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley;	28
ASV	Hosea	3	3	and I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be any mans wife: so will I also be toward thee.	28
ASV	Hosea	3	4	For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without pillar, and without ephod or teraphim:	28
ASV	Hosea	3	5	afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek Jehovah their God, and David their king, and shall come with fear unto Jehovah and to his goodness in the latter days.	28
ASV	Hosea	4	1	Hear the word of Jehovah, ye children of Israel; for Jehovah hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor goodness, nor knowledge of God in the land.	28
ASV	Hosea	4	2	There is nought but swearing and breaking faith, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery; they break out, and blood toucheth blood.	28
ASV	Hosea	4	3	Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.	28
ASV	Hosea	4	4	Yet let no man strive, neither let any man reprove; for thy people are as they that strive with the priest.	28
ASV	Hosea	4	5	And thou shalt stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night; and I will destroy thy mother.	28
ASV	Hosea	4	6	My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children.	28
ASV	Hosea	4	7	As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame.	28
ASV	Hosea	4	8	They feed on the sin of my people, and set their heart on their iniquity.	28
ASV	Hosea	4	9	And it shall be, like people, like priest; and I will punish them for their ways, and will requite them their doings.	28
ASV	Hosea	4	10	And they shall eat, and not have enough; they shall play the harlot, and shall not increase; because they have left off taking heed to Jehovah.	28
ASV	Hosea	4	11	Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the understanding.	28
ASV	Hosea	4	12	My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declareth unto them; for the spirit of whoredom hath caused them to err, and they have played the harlot, departing from under their God.	28
ASV	Hosea	4	13	They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters play the harlot, and your brides commit adultery.	28
ASV	Hosea	4	14	I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot, nor your brides when they commit adultery; for the men themselves go apart with harlots, and they sacrifice with the prostitutes; and the people that doth not understand shall be overthrown.	28
ASV	Hosea	4	15	Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, As Jehovah liveth.	28
ASV	Hosea	4	16	For Israel hath behaved himself stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer: now will Jehovah feed them as a lamb in a large place.	28
ASV	Hosea	4	17	Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone.	28
ASV	Hosea	4	18	Their drink is become sour; they play the harlot continually; her rulers dearly love shame.	28
ASV	Hosea	4	19	The wind hath wrapped her up in its wings; and they shall be put to shame because of their sacrifices.	28
ASV	Hosea	5	1	Hear this, O ye priests, and hearken, O house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king; for unto you pertaineth the judgment; for ye have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.	28
ASV	Hosea	5	2	And the revolters are gone deep in making slaughter; but I am a rebuker of them all.	28
ASV	Hosea	5	3	I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me; for now, O Ephraim, thou hast played the harlot, Israel is defiled.	28
ASV	Hosea	5	4	Their doings will not suffer them to turn unto their God; for the spirit of whoredom is within them, and they know not Jehovah.	28
ASV	Hosea	5	5	And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity; Judah also shall stumble with them.	28
ASV	Hosea	5	6	They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah; but they shall not find him: he hath withdrawn himself from them.	28
ASV	Hosea	5	7	They have dealt treacherously against Jehovah; for they have borne strange children: now shall the new moon devour them with their fields.	28
ASV	Hosea	5	8	Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: sound an alarm at Beth-aven; behind thee, O Benjamin.	28
ASV	Hosea	5	9	Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.	28
ASV	Hosea	5	10	The princes of Judah are like them that remove the landmark: I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.	28
ASV	Hosea	5	11	Ephraim is oppressed, he is crushed in judgment; because he was content to walk after mans command.	28
ASV	Hosea	5	12	Therefore am I unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.	28
ASV	Hosea	5	13	When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to Assyria, and sent to king Jareb: but he is not able to heal you, neither will he cure you of your wound.	28
ASV	Hosea	5	14	For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver.	28
ASV	Hosea	5	15	I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me earnestly.	28
ASV	Hosea	6	1	Come, and let us return unto Jehovah; for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.	28
ASV	Hosea	6	2	After two days will he revive us: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before him.	28
ASV	Hosea	6	3	And let us know, let us follow on to know Jehovah: his going forth is sure as the morning; and he will come unto us as the rain, as the latter rain that watereth the earth.	28
ASV	Hosea	6	4	O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goeth early away.	28
ASV	Hosea	6	5	Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.	28
ASV	Hosea	6	6	For I desire goodness, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings.	28
ASV	Hosea	6	7	But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.	28
ASV	Hosea	6	8	Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity; it is stained with blood.	28
ASV	Hosea	6	9	And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem; yea, they have committed lewdness.	28
ASV	Hosea	6	10	In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing: there whoredom is found in Ephraim, Israel is defiled.	28
ASV	Hosea	6	11	Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for thee, when I bring back the captivity of my people.	28
ASV	Hosea	7	1	When I would heal Israel, then is the iniquity of Ephraim uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria; for they commit falsehood, and the thief entereth in, and the troop of robbers ravageth without.	28
ASV	Hosea	7	2	And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now have their own doings beset them about; they are before my face.	28
ASV	Hosea	7	3	They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.	28
ASV	Hosea	7	4	They are all adulterers; they are as an oven heated by the baker; he ceaseth to stir the fire, from the kneading of the dough, until it be leavened.	28
ASV	Hosea	7	5	On the day of our king the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with scoffers.	28
ASV	Hosea	7	6	For they have made ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.	28
ASV	Hosea	7	7	They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.	28
ASV	Hosea	7	8	Ephraim, he mixeth himself among the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.	28
ASV	Hosea	7	9	Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, and he knoweth it not.	28
ASV	Hosea	7	10	And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: yet they have not returned unto Jehovah their God, nor sought him, for all this.	28
ASV	Hosea	7	11	And Ephraim is like a silly dove, without understanding: they call unto Egypt, they go to Assyria.	28
ASV	Hosea	7	12	When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the birds of the heavens; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.	28
ASV	Hosea	7	13	Woe unto them! for they have wandered from me; destruction unto them! for they have trespassed against me: though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken lies against me.	28
ASV	Hosea	7	14	And they have not cried unto me with their heart, but they howl upon their beds: they assemble themselves for grain and new wine; they rebel against me.	28
ASV	Hosea	7	15	Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet do they devise mischief against me.	28
ASV	Hosea	7	16	They return, but not to him that is on high; they are like a deceitful bow; their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.	28
ASV	Hosea	8	1	Set the trumpet to thy mouth. As an eagle he cometh against the house of Jehovah, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.	28
ASV	Hosea	8	2	They shall cry unto me, My God, we Israel know thee.	28
ASV	Hosea	8	3	Israel hath cast off that which is good: the enemy shall pursue him.	28
ASV	Hosea	8	4	They have set up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.	28
ASV	Hosea	8	5	He hath cast off thy calf, O Samaria; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?	28
ASV	Hosea	8	6	For from Israel is even this; the workman made it, and it is no God; yea, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.	28
ASV	Hosea	8	7	For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: he hath no standing grain; the blade shall yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up.	28
ASV	Hosea	8	8	Israel is swallowed up: now are they among the nations as a vessel wherein none delighteth.	28
ASV	Hosea	8	9	For they are gone up to Assyria, like a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.	28
ASV	Hosea	8	10	Yea, though they hire among the nations, now will I gather them; and they begin to be diminished by reason of the burden of the king of princes.	28
ASV	Hosea	8	11	Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars for sinning, altars have been unto him for sinning.	28
ASV	Hosea	8	12	I wrote for him the ten thousand things of my law; but they are counted as a strange thing.	28
ASV	Hosea	8	13	As for the sacrifices of mine offerings, they sacrifice flesh and eat it; but Jehovah accepteth them not: now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins; they shall return to Egypt.	28
ASV	Hosea	8	14	For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and builded palaces; and Judah hath multiplied fortified cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the castles thereof.	28
ASV	Hosea	9	1	Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, like the peoples; for thou hast played the harlot, departing from thy God; thou hast loved hire upon every grain-floor.	28
ASV	Hosea	9	2	The threshing-floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail her.	28
ASV	Hosea	9	3	They shall not dwell in Jehovahs land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean food in Assyria.	28
ASV	Hosea	9	4	They shall not pour out wine-offerings to Jehovah, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted; for their bread shall be for their appetite; it shall not com	28
ASV	Hosea	9	5	What will ye do in the day of solemn assembly, and in the day of the feast of Jehovah?	28
ASV	Hosea	9	6	For, lo, they are gone away from destruction; yet Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them; their pleasant things of silver, nettles shall possess them; thorns shall be in their tents.	28
ASV	Hosea	9	7	The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the man that hath the spirit is mad, for the abundance of thine iniquity, and because the enmity is great.	28
ASV	Hosea	9	8	Ephraim was a watchman with my God: as for the prophet, a fowlers snare is in all his ways, and enmity in the house of his God.	28
ASV	Hosea	9	9	They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.	28
ASV	Hosea	9	10	I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first-ripe in the fig-tree at its first season: but they came to Baal-peor, and consecrated themselves unto the shameful thing, and became abominable like that which they loved.	28
ASV	Hosea	9	11	As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird: there shall be no birth, and none with child, and no conception.	28
ASV	Hosea	9	12	Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, so that not a man shall be left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!	28
ASV	Hosea	9	13	Ephraim, like as I have seen Tyre, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring out his children to the slayer.	28
ASV	Hosea	9	14	Give them, O Jehovah-what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.	28
ASV	Hosea	9	15	All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I hated them: because of the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of my house; I will love them no more; all their princes are revolters.	28
ASV	Hosea	9	16	Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay the beloved fruit of their womb.	28
ASV	Hosea	9	17	My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him; and they shall be wanderers among the nations.	28
ASV	Hosea	10	1	Israel is a luxuriant vine, that putteth forth his fruit: according to the abundance of his fruit he hath multiplied his altars; according to the goodness of their land they have made goodly pillars.	28
ASV	Hosea	10	2	Their heart is divided; now shall they be found guilty: he will smite their altars, he will destroy their pillars.	28
ASV	Hosea	10	3	Surely now shall they say, We have no king; for we fear not Jehovah; and the king, what can he do for us?	28
ASV	Hosea	10	4	They speak vain words, swearing falsely in making covenants: therefore judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.	28
ASV	Hosea	10	5	The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in terror for the calves of Beth-aven; for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced over it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.	28
ASV	Hosea	10	6	It also shall be carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.	28
ASV	Hosea	10	7	As for Samaria, her king is cut off, as foam upon the water.	28
ASV	Hosea	10	8	The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.	28
ASV	Hosea	10	9	O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood; the battle against the children of iniquity doth not overtake them in Gibeah.	28
ASV	Hosea	10	10	When it is my desire, I will chastise them; and the peoples shall be gathered against them, when they are bound to their two transgressions.	28
ASV	Hosea	10	11	And Ephraim is a heifer that is taught, that loveth to tread out the grain; but I have passed over upon her fair neck: I will set a rider on Ephraim; Judah shall plow, Jacob shall break his clods.	28
ASV	Hosea	10	12	Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap according to kindness; break up your fallow ground; for it is time to seek Jehovah, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.	28
ASV	Hosea	10	13	Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies; for thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.	28
ASV	Hosea	10	14	Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces with her children.	28
ASV	Hosea	10	15	So shall Beth-el do unto you because of your great wickedness: at daybreak shall the king of Israel be utterly cut off.	28
ASV	Hosea	11	1	When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.	28
ASV	Hosea	11	2	The more the prophets called them, the more they went from them: they sacrificed unto the Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.	28
ASV	Hosea	11	3	Yet I taught Ephraim to walk; I took them on my arms; but they knew not that I healed them.	28
ASV	Hosea	11	4	I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as they that lift up the yoke on their jaws; and I laid food before them.	28
ASV	Hosea	11	5	They shall not return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian shall be their king, because they refused to return to me.	28
ASV	Hosea	11	6	And the sword shall fall upon their cities, and shall consume their bars, and devour them, because of their own counsels.	28
ASV	Hosea	11	7	And my people are bent on backsliding from me: though they call them to him that is on high, none at all will exalt him.	28
ASV	Hosea	11	8	How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I cast thee off, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboiim? my heart is turned within me, my compassions are kindled together.	28
ASV	Hosea	11	9	I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee; and I will not come in wrath.	28
ASV	Hosea	11	10	They shall walk after Jehovah, who will roar like a lion; for he will roar, and the children shall come trembling from the west.	28
ASV	Hosea	11	11	They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will make them to dwell in their houses, saith Jehovah.	28
ASV	Hosea	11	12	Ephraim compasseth me about with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the Holy One.	28
ASV	Hosea	12	1	Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he continually multiplieth lies and desolation; and they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt.	28
ASV	Hosea	12	2	Jehovah hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.	28
ASV	Hosea	12	3	In the womb he took his brother by the heel; and in his manhood he had power with God:	28
ASV	Hosea	12	4	yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him at Beth-el, and there he spake with us,	28
ASV	Hosea	12	5	even Jehovah, the God of hosts; Jehovah is his memorial name.	28
ASV	Hosea	12	6	Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep kindness and justice, and wait for thy God continually.	28
ASV	Hosea	12	7	He is a trafficker, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress.	28
ASV	Hosea	12	8	And Ephraim said, Surely I am become rich, I have found me wealth: in all my labors they shall find in me no iniquity that were sin.	28
ASV	Hosea	12	9	But I am Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt; I will yet again make thee to dwell in tents, as in the days of the solemn feast.	28
ASV	Hosea	12	10	I have also spoken unto the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and by the ministry of the prophets have I used similitudes.	28
ASV	Hosea	12	11	Is Gilead iniquity? they are altogether false; in Gilgal they sacrifice bullocks; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the field.	28
ASV	Hosea	12	12	And Jacob fled into the field of Aram, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.	28
ASV	Hosea	12	13	And by a prophet Jehovah brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.	28
ASV	Hosea	12	14	Ephraim hath provoked to anger most bitterly: therefore shall his blood be left upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.	28
ASV	Hosea	13	1	When Ephraim spake, there was trembling; he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.	28
ASV	Hosea	13	2	And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, even idols according to their own understanding, all of them the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.	28
ASV	Hosea	13	3	Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the dew that passeth early away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing-floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.	28
ASV	Hosea	13	4	Yet I am Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt; and thou shalt know no god but me, and besides me there is no saviour.	28
ASV	Hosea	13	5	I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.	28
ASV	Hosea	13	6	According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted: therefore have they forgotten me.	28
ASV	Hosea	13	7	Therefore am I unto them as a lion; as a leopard will I watch by the way;	28
ASV	Hosea	13	8	I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the caul of their heart; and there will I devour them like a lioness; the wild beast shall tear them.	28
ASV	Hosea	13	9	It is thy destruction, O Israel, that thou art against me, against thy help.	28
ASV	Hosea	13	10	Where now is thy king, that he may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges, of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes?	28
ASV	Hosea	13	11	I have given thee a king in mine anger, and have taken him away in my wrath.	28
ASV	Hosea	13	12	The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is laid up in store.	28
ASV	Hosea	13	13	The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is an unwise son; for it is time he should not tarry in the place of the breaking forth of children.	28
ASV	Hosea	13	14	I will ransom them from the power of Sheol; I will redeem them from death: O death, where are thy plagues? O Sheol, where is thy destruction? repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.	28
ASV	Hosea	13	15	Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall come, the breath of Jehovah coming up from the wilderness; and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall make spoil of the treasure of all goodly vessels.	28
ASV	Hosea	13	16	Samaria shall bear her guilt; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword; their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.	28
ASV	Hosea	14	1	O Israel, return unto Jehovah thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.	28
ASV	Hosea	14	2	Take with you words, and return unto Jehovah: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and accept that which is good: so will we render as bullocks the offering of our lips.	28
ASV	Hosea	14	3	Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses; neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods; for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.	28
ASV	Hosea	14	4	I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; for mine anger is turned away from him.	28
ASV	Hosea	14	5	I will be as the dew unto Israel; he shall blossom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.	28
ASV	Hosea	14	6	His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive-tree, and his smell as Lebanon.	28
ASV	Hosea	14	7	They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the grain, and blossom as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.	28
ASV	Hosea	14	8	Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have answered, and will regard him: I am like a green fir-tree; from me is thy fruit found.	28
ASV	Hosea	14	9	Who is wise, that he may understand these things? prudent, that he may know them? for the ways of Jehovah are right, and the just shall walk in them; but transgressors shall fall therein.	28
ASV	Joel	1	1	The word of Jehovah that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.	29
ASV	Joel	1	2	Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or in the days of your fathers?	29
ASV	Joel	1	3	Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation.	29
ASV	Joel	1	4	That which the palmer-worm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the canker-worm eaten; and that which the canker-worm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten.	29
ASV	Joel	1	5	Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and wail, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.	29
ASV	Joel	1	6	For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number; his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the jaw-teeth of a lioness.	29
ASV	Joel	1	7	He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig-tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.	29
ASV	Joel	1	8	Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.	29
ASV	Joel	1	9	The meal-offering and the drink-offering are cut off from the house of Jehovah; the priests, Jehovahs ministers, mourn.	29
ASV	Joel	1	10	The field is laid waste, the land mourneth; for the grain is destroyed, the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.	29
ASV	Joel	1	11	Be confounded, O ye husbandmen, wail, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; for the harvest of the field is perished.	29
ASV	Joel	1	12	The vine is withered, and the fig-tree languisheth; the pomegranate-tree, the palm-tree also, and the apple-tree, even all the trees of the field are withered: for joy is withered away from the sons of men.	29
ASV	Joel	1	13	Gird yourselves with sackcloth, and lament, ye priests; wail, ye ministers of the altar; come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meal-offering and the drink-offering are withholden from the house of your God.	29
ASV	Joel	1	14	Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the old men and all the inhabitants of the land unto the house of Jehovah your God, and cry unto Jehovah.	29
ASV	Joel	1	15	Alas for the day! for the day of Jehovah is at hand, and as destruction from the Almighty shall it come.	29
ASV	Joel	1	16	Is not the food cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God?	29
ASV	Joel	1	17	The seeds rot under their clods; the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the grain is withered.	29
ASV	Joel	1	18	How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.	29
ASV	Joel	1	19	O Jehovah, to thee do I cry; for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.	29
ASV	Joel	1	20	Yea, the beasts of the field pant unto thee; for the water brooks are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.	29
ASV	Joel	2	1	Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of Jehovah cometh, for it is nigh at hand;	29
ASV	Joel	2	2	a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the dawn spread upon the mountains; a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after them, even to the years of many generations.	29
ASV	Joel	2	3	A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and none hath escaped them.	29
ASV	Joel	2	4	The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so do they run.	29
ASV	Joel	2	5	Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.	29
ASV	Joel	2	6	At their presence the peoples are in anguish; all faces are waxed pale.	29
ASV	Joel	2	7	They run like mighty men; they climb the wall like men of war; and they march every one on his ways, and they break not their ranks.	29
ASV	Joel	2	8	Neither doth one thrust another; they march every one in his path; and they burst through the weapons, and break not off their course.	29
ASV	Joel	2	9	They leap upon the city; they run upon the wall; they climb up into the houses; they enter in at the windows like a thief.	29
ASV	Joel	2	10	The earth quaketh before them; the heavens tremble; the sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.	29
ASV	Joel	2	11	And Jehovah uttereth his voice before his army; for his camp is very great; for he is strong that executeth his word; for the day of Jehovah is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?	29
ASV	Joel	2	12	Yet even now, saith Jehovah, turn ye unto me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:	29
ASV	Joel	2	13	and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto Jehovah your God; for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and repenteth him of the evil.	29
ASV	Joel	2	14	Who knoweth whether he will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meal-offering and a drink-offering unto Jehovah your God?	29
ASV	Joel	2	15	Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly;	29
ASV	Joel	2	16	gather the people, sanctify the assembly, assemble the old men, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.	29
ASV	Joel	2	17	Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Jehovah, and give not thy heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the peoples, Whe	29
ASV	Joel	2	18	Then was Jehovah jealous for his land, and had pity on his people.	29
ASV	Joel	2	19	And Jehovah answered and said unto his people, Behold, I will send you grain, and new wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations;	29
ASV	Joel	2	20	but I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive it into a land barren and desolate, its forepart into the eastern sea, and its hinder part into the western sea; and its stench shall come up, and its ill savor shall come up, because it	29
ASV	Joel	2	21	Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice; for Jehovah hath done great things.	29
ASV	Joel	2	22	Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth its fruit, the fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength.	29
ASV	Joel	2	23	Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in Jehovah your God; for he giveth you the former rain in just measure, and he causeth to come down for you the rain, the former rain and the latter rain, in the first month.	29
ASV	Joel	2	24	And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil.	29
ASV	Joel	2	25	And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the canker-worm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm, my great army which I sent among you.	29
ASV	Joel	2	26	And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of Jehovah your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you; and my people shall never be put to shame.	29
ASV	Joel	2	27	And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am Jehovah your God, and there is none else; and my people shall never be put to shame.	29
ASV	Joel	2	28	And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:	29
ASV	Joel	2	29	and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit.	29
ASV	Joel	2	30	And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth: blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.	29
ASV	Joel	2	31	The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah cometh.	29
ASV	Joel	2	32	And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of Jehovah shall be delivered; for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those that escape, as Jehovah hath said, and among the remnant those whom Jehovah doth call.	29
ASV	Joel	3	1	For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring back the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,	29
ASV	Joel	3	2	I will gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat; and I will execute judgment upon them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations: and they have parted my land,	29
ASV	Joel	3	3	and have cast lots for my people, and have given a boy for a harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.	29
ASV	Joel	3	4	Yea, and what are ye to me, O Tyre, and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? will ye render me a recompense? and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompense upon your own head.	29
ASV	Joel	3	5	Forasmuch as ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly precious things,	29
ASV	Joel	3	6	and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem unto the sons of the Grecians, that ye may remove them far from their border;	29
ASV	Joel	3	7	behold, I will stir them up out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompense upon your own head;	29
ASV	Joel	3	8	and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the men of Sheba, to a nation far off: for Jehovah hath spoken it.	29
ASV	Joel	3	9	Proclaim ye this among the nations; prepare war; stir up the mighty men; let all the men of war draw near, let them come up.	29
ASV	Joel	3	10	Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning-hooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.	29
ASV	Joel	3	11	Haste ye, and come, all ye nations round about, and gather yourselves together: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O Jehovah.	29
ASV	Joel	3	12	Let the nations bestir themselves, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there will I sit to judge all the nations round about.	29
ASV	Joel	3	13	Put ye in the sickle; for the harvest is ripe: come, tread ye; for the winepress is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness is great.	29
ASV	Joel	3	14	Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! for the day of Jehovah is near in the valley of decision.	29
ASV	Joel	3	15	The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.	29
ASV	Joel	3	16	And Jehovah will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but Jehovah will be a refuge unto his people, and a stronghold to the children of Israel.	29
ASV	Joel	3	17	So shall ye know that I am Jehovah your God, dwelling in Zion my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.	29
ASV	Joel	3	18	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the brooks of Judah shall flow with waters; and a fountain shall come forth from the house of Jehovah, and shall water the va	29
ASV	Joel	3	19	Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence done to the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.	29
ASV	Joel	3	20	But Judah shall abide for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.	29
ASV	Joel	3	21	And I will cleanse their blood, that I have not cleansed: for Jehovah dwelleth in Zion.	29
ASV	Amos	1	1	The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.	30
ASV	Amos	1	2	And he said, Jehovah will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the pastures of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.	30
ASV	Amos	1	3	Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Damascus, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:	30
ASV	Amos	1	4	but I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.	30
ASV	Amos	1	5	And I will break the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden; and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith Jehovah.	30
ASV	Amos	1	6	Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Gaza, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive the whole people, to deliver them up to Edom:	30
ASV	Amos	1	7	but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.	30
ASV	Amos	1	8	And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon; and I will turn my hand against Ekron; and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord Jehovah.	30
ASV	Amos	1	9	Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Tyre, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they delivered up the whole people to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:	30
ASV	Amos	1	10	but I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.	30
ASV	Amos	1	11	Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Edom, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ev	30
ASV	Amos	1	12	but I will send a fire upon Teman, and it shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.	30
ASV	Amos	1	13	Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they may enlarge their border.	30
ASV	Amos	1	14	But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind;	30
ASV	Amos	1	15	and their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith Jehovah.	30
ASV	Amos	2	1	Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Moab, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:	30
ASV	Amos	2	2	but I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth; and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet;	30
ASV	Amos	2	3	and I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith Jehovah.	30
ASV	Amos	2	4	Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Judah, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have rejected the law of Jehovah, and have not kept his statutes, and their lies have caused them to err, after which their fat	30
ASV	Amos	2	5	but I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.	30
ASV	Amos	2	6	Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Israel, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes-	30
ASV	Amos	2	7	they that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father go unto the same maiden, to profane my holy name:	30
ASV	Amos	2	8	and they lay themselves down beside every altar upon clothes taken in pledge; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of such as have been fined.	30
ASV	Amos	2	9	Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.	30
ASV	Amos	2	10	Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.	30
ASV	Amos	2	11	And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazirites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith Jehovah.	30
ASV	Amos	2	12	But ye gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.	30
ASV	Amos	2	13	Behold, I will press you in your place, as a cart presseth that is full of sheaves.	30
ASV	Amos	2	14	And flight shall perish from the swift; and the strong shall not strengthen his force; neither shall the mighty deliver himself;	30
ASV	Amos	2	15	neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself; neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself;	30
ASV	Amos	2	16	and he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith Jehovah.	30
ASV	Amos	3	1	Hear this word that Jehovah hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt, saying,	30
ASV	Amos	3	2	You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will visit upon you all your iniquities.	30
ASV	Amos	3	3	Shall two walk together, except they have agreed?	30
ASV	Amos	3	4	Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?	30
ASV	Amos	3	5	Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is set for him? shall a snare spring up from the ground, and have taken nothing at all?	30
ASV	Amos	3	6	Shall the trumpet be blown in a city, and the people not be afraid? shall evil befall a city, and Jehovah hath not done it?	30
ASV	Amos	3	7	Surely the Lord Jehovah will do nothing, except he reveal his secret unto his servants the prophets.	30
ASV	Amos	3	8	The lion hath roared; who will not fear? The Lord Jehovah hath spoken; who can but prophesy?	30
ASV	Amos	3	9	Publish ye in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold what great tumults are therein, and what oppressions in the midst thereof.	30
ASV	Amos	3	10	For they know not to do right, saith Jehovah, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.	30
ASV	Amos	3	11	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: An adversary there shall be, even round about the land; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be plundered.	30
ASV	Amos	3	12	Thus saith Jehovah: As the shepherd rescueth out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear, so shall the children of Israel be rescued that sit in Samaria in the corner of a couch, and on the silken cushions of a bed.	30
ASV	Amos	3	13	Hear ye, and testify against the house of Jacob, saith the Lord Jehovah, the God of hosts.	30
ASV	Amos	3	14	For in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him, I will also visit the altars of Beth-el; and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.	30
ASV	Amos	3	15	And I will smite the winter-house with the summer-house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith Jehovah.	30
ASV	Amos	4	1	Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, that oppress the poor, that crush the needy, that say unto their lords, Bring, and let us drink.	30
ASV	Amos	4	2	The Lord Jehovah hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that they shall take you away with hooks, and your residue with fish-hooks.	30
ASV	Amos	4	3	And ye shall go out at the breaches, every one straight before her; and ye shall cast yourselves into Harmon, saith Jehovah.	30
ASV	Amos	4	4	Come to Beth-el, and transgress; to Gilgal, and multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes every three days;	30
ASV	Amos	4	5	and offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened, and proclaim freewill-offerings and publish them: for this pleaseth you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah.	30
ASV	Amos	4	6	And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places; yet have ye not returned unto me, saith Jehovah.	30
ASV	Amos	4	7	And I also have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest; and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.	30
ASV	Amos	4	8	So two or three cities wandered unto one city to drink water, and were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith Jehovah.	30
ASV	Amos	4	9	I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: the multitude of your gardens and your vineyards and your fig-trees and your olive-trees hath the palmer-worm devoured: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith Jehovah.	30
ASV	Amos	4	10	I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have carried away your horses; and I have made the stench of your camp to come up even into your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, sa	30
ASV	Amos	4	11	I have overthrown cities among you, as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a brand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith Jehovah.	30
ASV	Amos	4	12	Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel; and because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.	30
ASV	Amos	4	13	For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought; that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the Earth-jehovah, the God of hosts, is his name.	30
ASV	Amos	5	1	Hear ye this word which I take up for a lamentation over you, O house of Israel.	30
ASV	Amos	5	2	The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is cast down upon her land; there is none to raise her up.	30
ASV	Amos	5	3	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which went forth a hundred shall have ten left, to the house of Israel.	30
ASV	Amos	5	4	For thus saith Jehovah unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live;	30
ASV	Amos	5	5	but seek not Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth-el shall come to nought.	30
ASV	Amos	5	6	Seek Jehovah, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and it devour, and there be none to quench it in Beth-el.	30
ASV	Amos	5	7	Ye who turn justice to wormwood, and cast down righteousness to the earth,	30
ASV	Amos	5	8	seek him that maketh the Pleiades and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night; that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth (Jehovah is his name);	30
ASV	Amos	5	9	that bringeth sudden destruction upon the strong, so that destruction cometh upon the fortress.	30
ASV	Amos	5	10	They hate him that reproveth in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.	30
ASV	Amos	5	11	Forasmuch therefore as ye trample upon the poor, and take exactions from him of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink the wine thereof.	30
ASV	Amos	5	12	For I know how manifold are your transgressions, and how mighty are your sins-ye that afflict the just, that take a bribe, and that turn aside the needy in the gate from their right.	30
ASV	Amos	5	13	Therefore he that is prudent shall keep silence in such a time; for it is an evil time.	30
ASV	Amos	5	14	Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live; and so Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be with you, as ye say.	30
ASV	Amos	5	15	Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish justice in the gate: it may be that Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.	30
ASV	Amos	5	16	Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the Lord: Wailing shall be in all the broad ways; and they shall say in all the streets, Alas! Alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful in lamentation to wailing.	30
ASV	Amos	5	17	And in all vineyards shall be wailing; for I will pass through the midst of thee, saith Jehovah.	30
ASV	Amos	5	18	Woe unto you that desire the day of Jehovah! Wherefore would ye have the day of Jehovah? It is darkness, and not light.	30
ASV	Amos	5	19	As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.	30
ASV	Amos	5	20	Shall not the day of Jehovah be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?	30
ASV	Amos	5	21	I hate, I despise your feasts, and I will take no delight in your solemn assemblies.	30
ASV	Amos	5	22	Yea, though ye offer me your burnt-offerings and meal-offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your fat beasts.	30
ASV	Amos	5	23	Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.	30
ASV	Amos	5	24	But let justice roll down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.	30
ASV	Amos	5	25	Did ye bring unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?	30
ASV	Amos	5	26	Yea, ye have borne the tabernacle of your king and the shrine of your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.	30
ASV	Amos	5	27	Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith Jehovah, whose name is the God of hosts.	30
ASV	Amos	6	1	Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and to them that are secure in the mountain of Samaria, the notable men of the chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel come!	30
ASV	Amos	6	2	Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great; then go down to Gath of the Philistines: are they better than these kingdoms? or is their border greater than your border?	30
ASV	Amos	6	3	-ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;	30
ASV	Amos	6	4	that lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;	30
ASV	Amos	6	5	that sing idle songs to the sound of the viol; that invent for themselves instruments of music, like David;	30
ASV	Amos	6	6	that drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief oils; but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.	30
ASV	Amos	6	7	Therefore shall they now go captive with the first that go captive; and the revelry of them that stretched themselves shall pass away.	30
ASV	Amos	6	8	The Lord Jehovah hath sworn by himself, saith Jehovah, the God of hosts: I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces; therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.	30
ASV	Amos	6	9	And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.	30
ASV	Amos	6	10	And when a mans uncle shall take him up, even he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is in the innermost parts of the house, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall say, No; then shall he say, Hold thy p	30
ASV	Amos	6	11	For, behold, Jehovah commandeth, and the great house shall be smitten with breaches, and the little house with clefts.	30
ASV	Amos	6	12	Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow there with oxen? that ye have turned justice into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood;	30
ASV	Amos	6	13	ye that rejoice in a thing of nought, that say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?	30
ASV	Amos	6	14	For, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith Jehovah, the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entrance of Hamath unto the brook of the Arabah.	30
ASV	Amos	7	1	Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the kings mowings.	30
ASV	Amos	7	2	And it came to pass that, when they made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord Jehovah, forgive, I beseech thee: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small.	30
ASV	Amos	7	3	Jehovah repented concerning this: It shall not be, saith Jehovah.	30
ASV	Amos	7	4	Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, the Lord Jehovah called to content by fire; and it devoured the great deep, and would have eaten up the land.	30
ASV	Amos	7	5	Then said I, O Lord Jehovah, cease, I beseech thee: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small.	30
ASV	Amos	7	6	Jehovah repented concerning this: this also shall not be, saith the Lord Jehovah.	30
ASV	Amos	7	7	Thus he showed me: and, behold, the Lord stood beside a wall made by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand.	30
ASV	Amos	7	8	And Jehovah said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumb-line. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more;	30
ASV	Amos	7	9	and the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.	30
ASV	Amos	7	10	Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.	30
ASV	Amos	7	11	For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.	30
ASV	Amos	7	12	Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thou away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:	30
ASV	Amos	7	13	but prophesy not again any more at Beth-el; for it is the kings sanctuary, and it is a royal house.	30
ASV	Amos	7	14	Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophets son; but I was a herdsman, and a dresser of sycomore-trees:	30
ASV	Amos	7	15	and Jehovah took me from following the flock, and Jehovah said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.	30
ASV	Amos	7	16	Now therefore hear thou the word of Jehovah: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac;	30
ASV	Amos	7	17	therefore thus saith Jehovah: Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou thyself shalt die in a land that is unclean, and Israel shall surely be led away	30
ASV	Amos	8	1	Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, a basket of summer fruit.	30
ASV	Amos	8	2	And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said Jehovah unto me, The end is come upon my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.	30
ASV	Amos	8	3	And the songs of the temple shall be wailings in that day, saith the Lord Jehovah: the dead bodies shall be many: in every place shall they cast them forth with silence.	30
ASV	Amos	8	4	Hear this, O ye that would swallow up the needy, and cause the poor of the land to fail,	30
ASV	Amos	8	5	saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell grain? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and dealing falsely with balances of deceit;	30
ASV	Amos	8	6	that we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes, and sell the refuse of the wheat?	30
ASV	Amos	8	7	Jehovah hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.	30
ASV	Amos	8	8	Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? yea, it shall rise up wholly like the River; and it shall be troubled and sink again, like the River of Egypt.	30
ASV	Amos	8	9	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord Jehovah, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day.	30
ASV	Amos	8	10	And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning for an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.	30
ASV	Amos	8	11	Behold, the days come, saith the Lord Jehovah, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of Jehovah.	30
ASV	Amos	8	12	And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east; they shall run to and fro to seek the word of Jehovah, and shall not find it.	30
ASV	Amos	8	13	In that day shall the fair virgins and the young men faint for thirst.	30
ASV	Amos	8	14	They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, As thy god, O Dan, liveth; and, As the way of Beer-sheba liveth; they shall fall, and never rise up again.	30
ASV	Amos	9	1	I saw the Lord standing beside the altar: and he said, Smite the capitals, that the thresholds may shake; and break them in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: there shall not one of them flee away, and ther	30
ASV	Amos	9	2	Though they dig into Sheol, thence shall my hand take them; and though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down.	30
ASV	Amos	9	3	And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and it shall bite them.	30
ASV	Amos	9	4	And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.	30
ASV	Amos	9	5	For the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, is he that toucheth the land and it melteth, and all that dwell therein shall mourn; and it shall rise up wholly like the River, and shall sink again, like the River of Egypt;	30
ASV	Amos	9	6	it is he that buildeth his chambers in the heavens, and hath founded his vault upon the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth; Jehovah is his name.	30
ASV	Amos	9	7	Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith Jehovah. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?	30
ASV	Amos	9	8	Behold, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; save that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith Jehovah.	30
ASV	Amos	9	9	For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, like as grain is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least kernel fall upon the earth.	30
ASV	Amos	9	10	All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, who say, The evil shall not overtake nor meet us.	30
ASV	Amos	9	11	In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old;	30
ASV	Amos	9	12	that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations that are called by my name, saith Jehovah that doeth this.	30
ASV	Amos	9	13	Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.	30
ASV	Amos	9	14	And I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.	30
ASV	Amos	9	15	And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them, saith Jehovah thy God.	30
ASV	Obadiah	1	1	The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning Edom: We have heard tidings from Jehovah, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, saying, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.	31
ASV	Obadiah	1	2	Behold, I have made thee small among the nations: thou art greatly despised.	31
ASV	Obadiah	1	3	The pride of thy heart hath deceived thee, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?	31
ASV	Obadiah	1	4	Though thou mount on high as the eagle, and though thy nest be set among the stars, I will bring thee down from thence, saith Jehovah.	31
ASV	Obadiah	1	5	If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night (how art thou cut off!), would they not steal only till they had enough? if grape-gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes?	31
ASV	Obadiah	1	6	How are the things of Esau searched! how are his hidden treasures sought out!	31
ASV	Obadiah	1	7	All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee on thy way, even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread lay a snare under thee: there is no understanding in him.	31
ASV	Obadiah	1	8	Shall I not in that day, saith Jehovah, destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?	31
ASV	Obadiah	1	9	And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one may be cut off from the mount of Esau by slaughter.	31
ASV	Obadiah	1	10	For the violence done to thy brother Jacob, shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.	31
ASV	Obadiah	1	11	In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that strangers carried away his substance, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.	31
ASV	Obadiah	1	12	But look not thou on the day of thy brother in the day of his disaster, and rejoice not over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither speak proudly in the day of distress.	31
ASV	Obadiah	1	13	Enter not into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, look not thou on their affliction in the day of their calamity, neither lay ye hands on their substance in the day of their calamity.	31
ASV	Obadiah	1	14	And stand thou not in the crossway, to cut off those of his that escape; and deliver not up those of his that remain in the day of distress.	31
ASV	Obadiah	1	15	For the day of Jehovah is near upon all the nations: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee; thy dealing shall return upon thine own head.	31
ASV	Obadiah	1	16	For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the nations drink continually; yea, they shall drink, and swallow down, and shall be as though they had not been.	31
ASV	Obadiah	1	17	But in mount Zion there shall be those that escape, and it shall be holy; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.	31
ASV	Obadiah	1	18	And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall burn among them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining to the house of Esau; for Jehovah hath spoken it.	31
ASV	Obadiah	1	19	And they of the South shall possess the mount of Esau, and they of the lowland the Philistines; and they shall possess the field of Ephraim, and the field of Samaria; and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.	31
ASV	Obadiah	1	20	And the captives of this host of the children of Israel, that are among the Canaanites, shall possess even unto Zarephath; and the captives of Jerusalem, that are in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the South.	31
ASV	Obadiah	1	21	And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be Jehovahs.	31
ASV	Jonah	1	1	Now the word of Jehovah came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,	32
ASV	Jonah	1	2	Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.	32
ASV	Jonah	1	3	But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah; and he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah.	32
ASV	Jonah	1	4	But Jehovah sent out a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.	32
ASV	Jonah	1	5	Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god; and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it unto them. But Jonah was gone down into the innermost parts of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.	32
ASV	Jonah	1	6	So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.	32
ASV	Jonah	1	7	And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.	32
ASV	Jonah	1	8	Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; what is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?	32
ASV	Jonah	1	9	And he said unto them, I am a Hebrew; and I fear Jehovah, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land.	32
ASV	Jonah	1	10	Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, What is this that thou hast done? For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of Jehovah, because he had told them.	32
ASV	Jonah	1	11	Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea grew more and more tempestuous.	32
ASV	Jonah	1	12	And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.	32
ASV	Jonah	1	13	Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land; but they could not: for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them.	32
ASV	Jonah	1	14	Wherefore they cried unto Jehovah, and said, We beseech thee, O Jehovah, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this mans life, and lay not upon us innocent blood; for thou, O Jehovah, hast done as it pleased thee.	32
ASV	Jonah	1	15	So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging.	32
ASV	Jonah	1	16	Then the men feared Jehovah exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice unto Jehovah, and made vows.	32
ASV	Jonah	1	17	And Jehovah prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.	32
ASV	Jonah	2	1	Then Jonah prayed unto Jehovah his God out of the fishs belly.	32
ASV	Jonah	2	2	And he said, I called by reason of mine affliction unto Jehovah, And he answered me; Out of the belly of Sheol cried I, And thou heardest my voice.	32
ASV	Jonah	2	3	For thou didst cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas, And the flood was round about me; All thy waves and thy billows passed over me.	32
ASV	Jonah	2	4	And I said, I am cast out from before thine eyes; Yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.	32
ASV	Jonah	2	5	The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; The deep was round about me; The weeds were wrapped about my head.	32
ASV	Jonah	2	6	I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; The earth with its bars closed upon me for ever: Yet hast thou brought up my life from the pit, O Jehovah my God.	32
ASV	Jonah	2	7	When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Jehovah; And my prayer came in unto thee, into thy holy temple.	32
ASV	Jonah	2	8	They that regard lying vanities Forsake their own mercy.	32
ASV	Jonah	2	9	But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is of Jehovah.	32
ASV	Jonah	2	10	And Jehovah spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.	32
ASV	Jonah	3	1	And the word of Jehovah came unto Jonah the second time, saying,	32
ASV	Jonah	3	2	Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.	32
ASV	Jonah	3	3	So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of Jehovah. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of three days journey.	32
ASV	Jonah	3	4	And Jonah began to enter into the city a days journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.	32
ASV	Jonah	3	5	And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.	32
ASV	Jonah	3	6	And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.	32
ASV	Jonah	3	7	And he made proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water;	32
ASV	Jonah	3	8	but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his hands.	32
ASV	Jonah	3	9	Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?	32
ASV	Jonah	3	10	And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil which he said he would do unto them; and he did it not.	32
ASV	Jonah	4	1	But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.	32
ASV	Jonah	4	2	And he prayed unto Jehovah, and said, I pray thee, O Jehovah, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I hasted to flee unto Tarshish; for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindn	32
ASV	Jonah	4	3	Therefore now, O Jehovah, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.	32
ASV	Jonah	4	4	And Jehovah said, Doest thou well to be angry?	32
ASV	Jonah	4	5	Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shade, till he might see what would become of the city.	32
ASV	Jonah	4	6	And Jehovah God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver him from his evil case. So Jonah was exceeding glad because of the gourd.	32
ASV	Jonah	4	7	But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd, that it withered.	32
ASV	Jonah	4	8	And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.	32
ASV	Jonah	4	9	And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.	32
ASV	Jonah	4	10	And Jehovah said, Thou hast had regard for the gourd, for which thou hast not labored, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:	32
ASV	Jonah	4	11	and should not I have regard for Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?	32
ASV	Micah	1	1	The word of Jehovah that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.	33
ASV	Micah	1	2	Hear, ye peoples, all of you: hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord Jehovah be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.	33
ASV	Micah	1	3	For, behold, Jehovah cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.	33
ASV	Micah	1	4	And the mountains shall be melted under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, as waters that are poured down a steep place.	33
ASV	Micah	1	5	For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?	33
ASV	Micah	1	6	Therefore I will make Samaria as a heap of the field, and as places for planting vineyards; and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will uncover the foundations thereof.	33
ASV	Micah	1	7	And all her graven images shall be beaten to pieces, and all her hires shall be burned with fire, and all her idols will I lay desolate; for of the hire of a harlot hath she gathered them, and unto the hire of a harlot shall they return.	33
ASV	Micah	1	8	For this will I lament and wail; I will go stripped and naked; I will make a wailing like the jackals, and a lamentation like the ostriches.	33
ASV	Micah	1	9	For her wounds are incurable; for it is come even unto Judah; it reacheth unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.	33
ASV	Micah	1	10	Tell it not in Gath, weep not at all: at Beth-le-aphrah have I rolled myself in the dust.	33
ASV	Micah	1	11	Pass away, O inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame: the inhabitant of Zaanan is not come forth; the wailing of Beth-ezel shall take from you the stay thereof.	33
ASV	Micah	1	12	For the inhabitant of Maroth waiteth anxiously for good, because evil is come down from Jehovah unto the gate of Jerusalem.	33
ASV	Micah	1	13	Bind the chariot to the swift steed, O inhabitant of Lachish: she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.	33
ASV	Micah	1	14	Therefore shalt thou give a parting gift to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib shall be a deceitful thing unto the kings of Israel.	33
ASV	Micah	1	15	I will yet bring unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah, him that shall possess thee: the glory of Israel shall come even unto Adullam.	33
ASV	Micah	1	16	Make thee bald, and cut off thy hair for the children of thy delight: enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.	33
ASV	Micah	2	1	Woe to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.	33
ASV	Micah	2	2	And they covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away: and they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.	33
ASV	Micah	2	3	Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks, neither shall ye walk haughtily; for it is an evil time.	33
ASV	Micah	2	4	In that day shall they take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We are utterly ruined: he changeth the portion of my people: how doth he remove it from me! to the rebellious he divideth our fields.	33
ASV	Micah	2	5	Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the line by lot in the assembly of Jehovah.	33
ASV	Micah	2	6	Prophesy ye not, thus they prophesy. They shall not prophesy to these: reproaches shall not depart.	33
ASV	Micah	2	7	Shall it be said, O house of Jacob, Is the Spirit of Jehovah straitened? are these his doings? Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?	33
ASV	Micah	2	8	But of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye strip the robe from off the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.	33
ASV	Micah	2	9	The women of my people ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their young children ye take away my glory for ever.	33
ASV	Micah	2	10	Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your resting-place; because of uncleanness that destroyeth, even with a grievous destruction.	33
ASV	Micah	2	11	If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.	33
ASV	Micah	2	12	I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as a flock in the midst of their pasture; they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.	33
ASV	Micah	2	13	The breaker is gone up before them: they have broken forth and passed on to the gate, and are gone out thereat; and their king is passed on before them, and Jehovah at the head of them.	33
ASV	Micah	3	1	And I said, Hear, I pray you, ye heads of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel: is it not for you to know justice?	33
ASV	Micah	3	2	ye who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;	33
ASV	Micah	3	3	who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them, and break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.	33
ASV	Micah	3	4	Then shall they cry unto Jehovah, but he will not answer them; yea, he will hide his face from them at that time, according as they have wrought evil in their doings.	33
ASV	Micah	3	5	Thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets that make my people to err; that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and whoso putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him:	33
ASV	Micah	3	6	Therefore it shall be night unto you, that ye shall have no vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be black over them.	33
ASV	Micah	3	7	And the seers shall be put to shame, and the diviners confounded; yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.	33
ASV	Micah	3	8	But as for me, I am full of power by the Spirit of Jehovah, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.	33
ASV	Micah	3	9	Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, that abhor justice, and pervert all equity.	33
ASV	Micah	3	10	They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.	33
ASV	Micah	3	11	The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet they lean upon Jehovah, and say, Is not Jehovah in the midst of us? no evil shall come upon us.	33
ASV	Micah	3	12	Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.	33
ASV	Micah	4	1	But in the latter days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of Jehovahs house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and peoples shall flow unto it.	33
ASV	Micah	4	2	And many nations shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah	33
ASV	Micah	4	3	and he will judge between many peoples, and will decide concerning strong nations afar off: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war	33
ASV	Micah	4	4	But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of Jehovah of hosts hath spoken it.	33
ASV	Micah	4	5	For all the peoples walk every one in the name of his god; and we will walk in the name of Jehovah our God for ever and ever.	33
ASV	Micah	4	6	In that day, saith Jehovah, will I assemble that which is lame, and I will gather that which is driven away, and that which I have afflicted;	33
ASV	Micah	4	7	and I will make that which was lame a remnant, and that which was cast far off a strong nation: and Jehovah will reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth even for ever.	33
ASV	Micah	4	8	And thou, O tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, yea, the former dominion shall come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.	33
ASV	Micah	4	9	Now why dost thou cry out aloud? Is there no king in thee, is thy counsellor perished, that pangs have taken hold of thee as of a woman in travail?	33
ASV	Micah	4	10	Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail; for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and shalt dwell in the field, and shalt come even unto Babylon: there shalt thou be rescued; there will Jehovah redeem thee fro	33
ASV	Micah	4	11	And now many nations are assembled against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye see our desire upon Zion.	33
ASV	Micah	4	12	But they know not the thoughts of Jehovah, neither understand they his counsel; for he hath gathered them as the sheaves to the threshing-floor.	33
ASV	Micah	4	13	Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; for I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass; and thou shalt beat in pieces many peoples: and I will devote their gain unto Jehovah, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.	33
ASV	Micah	5	1	Now shalt thou gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us; they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.	33
ASV	Micah	5	2	But thou, Beth-lehem Ephrathah, which art little to be among the thousands of Judah, out of thee shall one come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.	33
ASV	Micah	5	3	Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she who travaileth hath brought forth: then the residue of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.	33
ASV	Micah	5	4	And he shall stand, and shall feed his flock in the strength of Jehovah, in the majesty of the name of Jehovah his God: and they shall abide; for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.	33
ASV	Micah	5	5	And this man shall be our peace. When the Assyrian shall come into our land, and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.	33
ASV	Micah	5	6	And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: and he shall deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our border.	33
ASV	Micah	5	7	And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples as dew from Jehovah, as showers upon the grass, that tarry not for man, nor wait for the sons of men.	33
ASV	Micah	5	8	And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep; who, if he go through, treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and there is none to delive	33
ASV	Micah	5	9	Let thy hand be lifted up above thine adversaries, and let all thine enemies be cut off.	33
ASV	Micah	5	10	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and will destroy thy chariots:	33
ASV	Micah	5	11	and I will cut off the cities of thy land, and will throw down all thy strongholds.	33
ASV	Micah	5	12	And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thy hand; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers:	33
ASV	Micah	5	13	and I will cut off thy graven images and thy pillars out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thy hands;	33
ASV	Micah	5	14	and I will pluck up thine Asherim out of the midst of thee; and I will destroy thy cities.	33
ASV	Micah	5	15	And I will execute vengeance in anger and wrath upon the nations which hearkened not.	33
ASV	Micah	6	1	Hear ye now what Jehovah saith: Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.	33
ASV	Micah	6	2	Hear, O ye mountains, Jehovahs controversy, and ye enduring foundations of the earth; for Jehovah hath a controversy with his people, and he will contend with Israel.	33
ASV	Micah	6	3	O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.	33
ASV	Micah	6	4	For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.	33
ASV	Micah	6	5	O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; remember from Shittim unto Gilgal, that ye may know the righteous acts of Jehovah.	33
ASV	Micah	6	6	Wherewith shall I come before Jehovah, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves a year old?	33
ASV	Micah	6	7	will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?	33
ASV	Micah	6	8	He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth Jehovah require of thee, but to do justly, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with thy God?	33
ASV	Micah	6	9	The voice of Jehovah crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom will see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.	33
ASV	Micah	6	10	Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and a scant measure that is abominable?	33
ASV	Micah	6	11	Shall I be pure with wicked balances, and with a bag of deceitful weights?	33
ASV	Micah	6	12	For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.	33
ASV	Micah	6	13	Therefore I also have smitten thee with a grievous wound; I have made thee desolate because of thy sins.	33
ASV	Micah	6	14	Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy humiliation shall be in the midst of thee: and thou shalt put away, but shalt not save; and that which thou savest will I give up to the sword.	33
ASV	Micah	6	15	Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but shalt not anoint thee with oil; and the vintage, but shalt not drink the wine.	33
ASV	Micah	6	16	For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I may make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof a hissing: and ye shall bear the reproach of my people.	33
ASV	Micah	7	1	Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat; my soul desireth the first-ripe fig.	33
ASV	Micah	7	2	The godly man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.	33
ASV	Micah	7	3	Their hands are upon that which is evil to do it diligently; the prince asketh, and the judge is ready for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth the evil desire of his soul: thus they weave it together.	33
ASV	Micah	7	4	The best of them is as a brier; the most upright is worse than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen, even thy visitation, is come; now shall be their perplexity.	33
ASV	Micah	7	5	Trust ye not in a neighbor; put ye not confidence in a friend; keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.	33
ASV	Micah	7	6	For the son dishonoreth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a mans enemies are the men of his own house.	33
ASV	Micah	7	7	But as for me, I will look unto Jehovah; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.	33
ASV	Micah	7	8	Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, Jehovah will be a light unto me.	33
ASV	Micah	7	9	I will bear the indignation of Jehovah, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.	33
ASV	Micah	7	10	Then mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her who said unto me, Where is Jehovah thy God? Mine eyes shall see my desire upon her; now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.	33
ASV	Micah	7	11	A day for building thy walls! in that day shall the decree be far removed.	33
ASV	Micah	7	12	In that day shall they come unto thee from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.	33
ASV	Micah	7	13	Yet shall the land be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.	33
ASV	Micah	7	14	Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thy heritage, which dwell solitarily, in the forest in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.	33
ASV	Micah	7	15	As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt will I show unto them marvellous things.	33
ASV	Micah	7	16	The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might; they shall lay their hand upon their mouth; their ears shall be deaf.	33
ASV	Micah	7	17	They shall lick the dust like a serpent; like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their close places; they shall come with fear unto Jehovah our God, and shall be afraid because of thee.	33
ASV	Micah	7	18	Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth over the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in lovingkindness.	33
ASV	Micah	7	19	He will again have compassion upon us; he will tread our iniquities under foot; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.	33
ASV	Micah	7	20	Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the lovingkindness to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.	33
ASV	Nahum	1	1	The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.	34
ASV	Nahum	1	2	Jehovah is a jealous God and avengeth; Jehovah avengeth and is full of wrath; Jehovah taketh vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.	34
ASV	Nahum	1	3	Jehovah is slow to anger, and great in power, and will by no means clear the guilty: Jehovah hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.	34
ASV	Nahum	1	4	He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel; and the flower of Lebanon languisheth.	34
ASV	Nahum	1	5	The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt; and the earth is upheaved at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.	34
ASV	Nahum	1	6	Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken asunder by him.	34
ASV	Nahum	1	7	Jehovah is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that take refuge in him.	34
ASV	Nahum	1	8	But with an over-running flood he will make a full end of her place, and will pursue his enemies into darkness.	34
ASV	Nahum	1	9	What do ye devise against Jehovah? he will make a full end; affliction shall not rise up the second time.	34
ASV	Nahum	1	10	For entangled like thorns, and drunken as with their drink, they are consumed utterly as dry stubble.	34
ASV	Nahum	1	11	There is one gone forth out of thee, that deviseth evil against Jehovah, that counselleth wickedness.	34
ASV	Nahum	1	12	Thus saith Jehovah: Though they be in full strength, and likewise many, even so shall they be cut down, and he shall pass away. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.	34
ASV	Nahum	1	13	And now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.	34
ASV	Nahum	1	14	And Jehovah hath given commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image; I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.	34
ASV	Nahum	1	15	Behold, upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! Keep thy feasts, O Judah, perform thy vows; for the wicked one shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.	34
ASV	Nahum	2	1	He that dasheth in pieces is come up against thee: keep the fortress, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily.	34
ASV	Nahum	2	2	For Jehovah restoreth the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel; for the emptiers have emptied them out, and destroyed their vine-branches.	34
ASV	Nahum	2	3	The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation, and the cypress spears are brandished.	34
ASV	Nahum	2	4	The chariots rage in the streets; they rush to and fro in the broad ways: the appearance of them is like torches; they run like the lightnings.	34
ASV	Nahum	2	5	He remembereth his nobles: they stumble in their march; they make haste to the wall thereof, and the mantelet is prepared.	34
ASV	Nahum	2	6	The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved.	34
ASV	Nahum	2	7	And it is decreed: she is uncovered, she is carried away; and her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves, beating upon their breasts.	34
ASV	Nahum	2	8	But Nineveh hath been from of old like a pool of water: yet they flee away. Stand, stand, they cry; but none looketh back.	34
ASV	Nahum	2	9	Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold; for there is no end of the store, the glory of all goodly furniture.	34
ASV	Nahum	2	10	She is empty, and void, and waste; and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and anguish is in all loins, and the faces of them all are waxed pale.	34
ASV	Nahum	2	11	Where is the den of the lions, and the feeding-place of the young lions, where the lion and the lioness walked, the lions whelp, and none made them afraid?	34
ASV	Nahum	2	12	The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caves with prey, and his dens with ravin.	34
ASV	Nahum	2	13	Behold, I am against thee, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions; and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.	34
ASV	Nahum	3	1	Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and rapine; the prey departeth not.	34
ASV	Nahum	3	2	The noise of the whip, and the noise of the rattling of wheels, and prancing horses, and bounding chariots,	34
ASV	Nahum	3	3	the horseman mounting, and the flashing sword, and the glittering spear, and a multitude of slain, and a great heap of corpses, and there is no end of the bodies; they stumble upon their bodies;-	34
ASV	Nahum	3	4	because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the well-favored harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.	34
ASV	Nahum	3	5	Behold, I am against thee, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will uncover thy skirts upon thy face; and I will show the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.	34
ASV	Nahum	3	6	And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazing-stock.	34
ASV	Nahum	3	7	And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?	34
ASV	Nahum	3	8	Art thou better than No-amon, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters round about her; whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was of the sea?	34
ASV	Nahum	3	9	Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.	34
ASV	Nahum	3	10	Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity; her young children also were dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets; and they cast lots for her honorable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.	34
ASV	Nahum	3	11	Thou also shalt be drunken; thou shalt be hid; thou also shalt seek a stronghold because of the enemy.	34
ASV	Nahum	3	12	All thy fortresses shall be like fig-trees with the first-ripe figs: if they be shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater.	34
ASV	Nahum	3	13	Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women; the gates of thy land are set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire hath devoured thy bars.	34
ASV	Nahum	3	14	Draw thee water for the siege; strengthen thy fortresses; go into the clay, and tread the mortar; make strong the brickkiln.	34
ASV	Nahum	3	15	There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off; it shall devour thee like the canker-worm: make thyself many as the canker-worm; make thyself many as the locust.	34
ASV	Nahum	3	16	Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the canker-worm ravageth, and fleeth away.	34
ASV	Nahum	3	17	Thy princes are as the locusts, and thy marshals as the swarms of grasshoppers, which encamp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are.	34
ASV	Nahum	3	18	Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria; thy nobles are at rest; thy people are scattered upon the mountains, and there is none to gather them.	34
ASV	Nahum	3	19	There is no assuaging of thy hurt: thy wound is grievous: all that hear the report of thee clap their hands over thee; for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?	34
ASV	Habakkuk	1	1	The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	1	2	O Jehovah, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear? I cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	1	3	Why dost thou show me iniquity, and look upon perverseness? for destruction and violence are before me; and there is strife, and contention riseth up.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	1	4	Therefore the law is slacked, and justice doth never go forth; for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore justice goeth forth perverted.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	1	5	Behold ye among the nations, and look, and wonder marvellously; for I am working a work in your days, which ye will not believe though it be told you.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	1	6	For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling-places that are not theirs.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	1	7	They are terrible and dreadful; their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	1	8	Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves; and their horsemen press proudly on: yea, their horsemen come from far; they fly as an eagle that hasteth to devour.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	1	9	They come all of them for violence; the set of their faces is forwards; and they gather captives as the sand.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	1	10	Yea, he scoffeth at kings, and princes are a derision unto him; he derideth every stronghold; for he heapeth up dust, and taketh it.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	1	11	Then shall he sweep by as a wind, and shall pass over, and be guilty, even he whose might is his god.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	1	12	Art not thou from everlasting, O Jehovah my God, my Holy One? we shall not die. O Jehovah, thou hast ordained him for judgment; and thou, O Rock, hast established him for correction.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	1	13	Thou that art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and that canst not look on perverseness, wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy peace when the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he;	35
ASV	Habakkuk	1	14	and makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?	35
ASV	Habakkuk	1	15	He taketh up all of them with the angle, he catcheth them in his net, and gathereth them in his drag: therefore he rejoiceth and is glad.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	1	16	Therefore he sacrificeth unto his net, and burneth incense unto his drag; because by them his portion is fat, and his food plenteous.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	1	17	Shall he therefore empty his net, and spare not to slay the nations continually?	35
ASV	Habakkuk	2	1	I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will look forth to see what he will speak with me, and what I shall answer concerning my complaint.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	2	2	And Jehovah answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tablets, that he may run that readeth it.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	2	3	For the vision is yet for the appointed time, and it hasteth toward the end, and shall not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not delay.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	2	4	Behold, his soul is puffed up, it is not upright in him; but the righteous shall live by his faith.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	2	5	Yea, moreover, wine is treacherous, a haughty man, that keepeth not at home; who enlargeth his desire as Sheol, and he is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all peoples.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	2	6	Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and that ladeth himself with pledges!	35
ASV	Habakkuk	2	7	Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booty unto them?	35
ASV	Habakkuk	2	8	Because thou hast plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall plunder thee, because of mens blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	2	9	Woe to him that getteth an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil!	35
ASV	Habakkuk	2	10	Thou hast devised shame to thy house, by cutting off many peoples, and hast sinned against thy soul.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	2	11	For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	2	12	Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and establisheth a city by iniquity!	35
ASV	Habakkuk	2	13	Behold, is it not of Jehovah of hosts that the peoples labor for the fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity?	35
ASV	Habakkuk	2	14	For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	2	15	Woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink, to thee that addest thy venom, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!	35
ASV	Habakkuk	2	16	Thou art filled with shame, and not glory: drink thou also, and be as one uncircumcised; the cup of Jehovahs right hand shall come round unto thee, and foul shame shall be upon thy glory.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	2	17	For the violence done to Lebanon shall cover thee, and the destruction of the beasts, which made them afraid; because of mens blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	2	18	What profiteth the graven image, that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, even the teacher of lies, that he that fashioneth its form trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?	35
ASV	Habakkuk	2	19	Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise! Shall this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	2	20	But Jehovah is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	3	1	A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, set to Shigionoth.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	3	2	O Jehovah, I have heard the report of thee, and am afraid: O Jehovah, revive thy work in the midst of the years; In the midst of the years make it known; In wrath remember mercy.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	3	3	God came from Teman, And the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, And the earth was full of his praise.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	3	4	And his brightness was as the light; He had rays coming forth from his hand; And there was the hiding of his power.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	3	5	Before him went the pestilence, And fiery bolts went forth at his feet.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	3	6	He stood, and measured the earth; He beheld, and drove asunder the nations; And the eternal mountains were scattered; The everlasting hills did bow; His goings were as of old.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	3	7	I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction; The curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	3	8	Was Jehovah displeased with the rivers? Was thine anger against the rivers, Or thy wrath against the sea, That thou didst ride upon thy horses, Upon thy chariots of salvation?	35
ASV	Habakkuk	3	9	Thy bow was made quite bare; The oaths to the tribes were a sure word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	3	10	The mountains saw thee, and were afraid; The tempest of waters passed by; The deep uttered its voice, And lifted up its hands on high.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	3	11	The sun and moon stood still in their habitation, At the light of thine arrows as they went, At the shining of thy glittering spear.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	3	12	Thou didst march though the land in indignation; Thou didst thresh the nations in anger.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	3	13	Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, For the salvation of thine anointed; Thou woundest the head out of the house of the wicked man, Laying bare the foundation even unto the neck. Selah.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	3	14	Thou didst pierce with his own staves the head of his warriors: They came as a whirlwind to scatter me; Their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	3	15	Thou didst tread the sea with thy horses, The heap of mighty waters.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	3	16	I heard, and my body trembled, My lips quivered at the voice; Rottenness entereth into my bones, and I tremble in my place; Because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble, For the coming up of the people that invadeth us.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	3	17	For though the fig-tree shall not flourish, Neither shall fruit be in the vines; The labor of the olive shall fail, And the fields shall yield no food; The flock shall be cut off from the fold, And there shall be no herd in the stalls:	35
ASV	Habakkuk	3	18	Yet I will rejoice in Jehovah, I will joy in the God of my salvation.	35
ASV	Habakkuk	3	19	Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength; And he maketh my feet like hinds feet, And will make me to walk upon my high places.	35
ASV	Zephaniah	1	1	The word of Jehovah which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	1	2	I will utterly consume all things from off the face of the ground, saith Jehovah.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	1	3	I will consume man and beast; I will consume the birds of the heavens, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the face of the ground, saith Jehovah.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	1	4	And I will stretch out my hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarim with the priests;	36
ASV	Zephaniah	1	5	and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship, that swear to Jehovah and swear by Malcam;	36
ASV	Zephaniah	1	6	and them that are turned back from following Jehovah; and those that have not sought Jehovah, nor inquired after him.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	1	7	Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord Jehovah; for the day of Jehovah is at hand: for Jehovah hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath consecrated his guests.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	1	8	And it shall come to pass in the day of Jehovahs sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the kings sons, and all such as are clothed with foreign apparel.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	1	9	And in that day I will punish all those that leap over the threshold, that fill their masters house with violence and deceit.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	1	10	And in that day, saith Jehovah, there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and a wailing from the second quarter, and a great crashing from the hills.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	1	11	Wail, ye inhabitants of Maktesh; for all the people of Canaan are undone; all they that were laden with silver are cut off.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	1	12	And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps; and I will punish the men that are settled on their lees, that say in their heart, Jehovah will not do good, neither will he do evil.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	1	13	And their wealth shall become a spoil, and their houses a desolation: yea, they shall build houses, but shall not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but shall not drink the wine thereof.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	1	14	The great day of Jehovah is near, it is near and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of Jehovah; the mighty man crieth there bitterly.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	1	15	That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,	36
ASV	Zephaniah	1	16	a day of the trumpet and alarm, against the fortified cities, and against the high battlements.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	1	17	And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against Jehovah; and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as dung.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	1	18	Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of Jehovahs wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he will make an end, yea, a terrible end, of all them that dwell in the land.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	2	1	Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation that hath no shame;	36
ASV	Zephaniah	2	2	before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of Jehovah come upon you, before the day of Jehovahs anger come upon you.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	2	3	Seek ye Jehovah, all ye meek of the earth, that have kept his ordinances; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye will be hid in the day of Jehovahs anger.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	2	4	For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation; they shall drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	2	5	Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea-coast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan, the land of the Philistines; I will destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	2	6	And the sea-coast shall be pastures, with cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	2	7	And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed their flocks thereupon; in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening; for Jehovah their God will visit them, and bring back their captivity.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	2	8	I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, wherewith they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	2	9	Therefore as I live, saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall make a prey of them, an	36
ASV	Zephaniah	2	10	This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah of hosts.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	2	11	Jehovah will be terrible unto them; for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his place, even all the isles of the nations.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	2	12	Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	2	13	And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria, and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like the wilderness.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	2	14	And herds shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the pelican and the porcupine shall lodge in the capitals thereof; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds: for he hath laid bare the ce	36
ASV	Zephaniah	2	15	This is the joyous city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none besides me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	3	1	Woe to her that is rebellious and polluted! to the oppressing city!	36
ASV	Zephaniah	3	2	She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in Jehovah; she drew not near to her God.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	3	3	Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they leave nothing till the morrow.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	3	4	Her prophets are light and treacherous persons; her priests have profaned the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	3	5	Jehovah in the midst of her is righteous; he will not do iniquity; every morning doth he bring his justice to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	3	6	I have cut off nations; their battlements are desolate; I have made their streets waste, so that none passeth by; their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	3	7	I said, Only fear thou me; receive correction; so her dwelling shall not be cut off, according to all that I have appointed concerning her: but they rose early and corrupted all their doings.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	3	8	Therefore wait ye for me, saith Jehovah, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth shall be de	36
ASV	Zephaniah	3	9	For then will I turn to the peoples of a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of Jehovah, to serve him with one consent.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	3	10	From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	3	11	In that day shalt thou not be put to shame for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me; for then I will take away out of the midst of thee thy proudly exulting ones, and thou shalt no more be haughty in my holy mountain.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	3	12	But I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall take refuge in the name of Jehovah.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	3	13	The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth; for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	3	14	Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	3	15	Jehovah hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the King of Israel, even Jehovah, is in the midst of thee; thou shalt not fear evil any more.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	3	16	In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not; O Zion, let not thy hands be slack.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	3	17	Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, a mighty one who will save; he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will joy over thee with singing.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	3	18	I will gather them that sorrow for the solemn assembly, who were of thee; to whom the burden upon her was a reproach.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	3	19	Behold, at that time I will deal with all them that afflict thee; and I will save that which is lame, and gather that which was driven away; and I will make them a praise and a name, whose shame hath been in all the earth.	36
ASV	Zephaniah	3	20	At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather you; for I will make you a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I bring back your captivity before your eyes, saith Jehovah.	36
ASV	Haggai	1	1	In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying,	37
ASV	Haggai	1	2	Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, This people say, It is not the time for us to come, the time for Jehovahs house to be built.	37
ASV	Haggai	1	3	Then came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet, saying,	37
ASV	Haggai	1	4	Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your ceiled houses, while this house lieth waste?	37
ASV	Haggai	1	5	Now therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Consider your ways.	37
ASV	Haggai	1	6	Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.	37
ASV	Haggai	1	7	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Consider your ways.	37
ASV	Haggai	1	8	Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith Jehovah.	37
ASV	Haggai	1	9	Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith Jehovah of hosts. Because of my house that lieth waste, while ye run every man to his own house.	37
ASV	Haggai	1	10	Therefore for your sake the heavens withhold the dew, and the earth withholdeth its fruit.	37
ASV	Haggai	1	11	And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the grain, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labor of the hands.	37
ASV	Haggai	1	12	Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of Jehovah their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as Jehovah their God had sent him; and the people did f	37
ASV	Haggai	1	13	Then spake Haggai Jehovahs messenger in Jehovahs message unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith Jehovah.	37
ASV	Haggai	1	14	And Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work on the house of Jehovah of	37
ASV	Haggai	1	15	in the four and twentieth day of the month, in the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.	37
ASV	Haggai	2	1	In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet, saying,	37
ASV	Haggai	2	2	Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,	37
ASV	Haggai	2	3	Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes as nothing?	37
ASV	Haggai	2	4	Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith Jehovah; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith Jehovah, and work: for I am with you, saith Jehovah of hosts,	37
ASV	Haggai	2	5	according to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, and my Spirit abode among you: fear ye not.	37
ASV	Haggai	2	6	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;	37
ASV	Haggai	2	7	and I will shake all nations; and the precious things of all nations shall come; and I will fill this house with glory, saith Jehovah of hosts.	37
ASV	Haggai	2	8	The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith Jehovah of hosts.	37
ASV	Haggai	2	9	The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former, saith Jehovah of hosts; and in this place will I give peace, saith Jehovah of hosts.	37
ASV	Haggai	2	10	In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet, saying,	37
ASV	Haggai	2	11	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,	37
ASV	Haggai	2	12	If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food, shall it become holy? And the priests answered and said, No.	37
ASV	Haggai	2	13	Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by reason of a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.	37
ASV	Haggai	2	14	Then answered Haggai and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith Jehovah; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.	37
ASV	Haggai	2	15	And now, I pray you, consider from this day and backward, before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of Jehovah.	37
ASV	Haggai	2	16	Through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten; when one came to the winevat to draw out fifty vessels, there were but twenty.	37
ASV	Haggai	2	17	I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the work of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith Jehovah.	37
ASV	Haggai	2	18	Consider, I pray you, from this day and backward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, since the day that the foundation of Jehovahs temple was laid, consider it.	37
ASV	Haggai	2	19	Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, the vine, and the fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-tree have not brought forth; from this day will I bless you.	37
ASV	Haggai	2	20	And the word of Jehovah came the second time unto Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month, saying,	37
ASV	Haggai	2	21	Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;	37
ASV	Haggai	2	22	and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms; and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his bro	37
ASV	Haggai	2	23	In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith Jehovah, and will make thee as a signet; for I have chosen thee, saith Jehovah of hosts.	37
ASV	Zechariah	1	1	In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,	38
ASV	Zechariah	1	2	Jehovah was sore displeased with your fathers.	38
ASV	Zechariah	1	3	Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Return unto me, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will return unto you, saith Jehovah of hosts.	38
ASV	Zechariah	1	4	Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets cried, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Return ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith Jehovah.	38
ASV	Zechariah	1	5	Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?	38
ASV	Zechariah	1	6	But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? and they turned and said, Like as Jehovah of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt wi	38
ASV	Zechariah	1	7	Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,	38
ASV	Zechariah	1	8	I saw in the night, and, behold, a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle-trees that were in the bottom; and behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white.	38
ASV	Zechariah	1	9	Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will show thee what these are.	38
ASV	Zechariah	1	10	And the man that stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said, These are they whom Jehovah hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.	38
ASV	Zechariah	1	11	And they answered the angel of Jehovah that stood among the myrtle-trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.	38
ASV	Zechariah	1	12	Then the angel of Jehovah answered and said, O Jehovah of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?	38
ASV	Zechariah	1	13	And Jehovah answered the angel that talked with me with good words, even comfortable words.	38
ASV	Zechariah	1	14	So the angel that talked with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.	38
ASV	Zechariah	1	15	And I am very sore displeased with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.	38
ASV	Zechariah	1	16	Therefore thus saith Jehovah: I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies; my house shall be built in it, saith Jehovah of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem.	38
ASV	Zechariah	1	17	Cry yet again, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: My cities shall yet overflow with prosperity; and Jehovah shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.	38
ASV	Zechariah	1	18	And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, four horns.	38
ASV	Zechariah	1	19	And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.	38
ASV	Zechariah	1	20	And Jehovah showed me four smiths.	38
ASV	Zechariah	1	21	Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head; but these are come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the lan	38
ASV	Zechariah	2	1	And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.	38
ASV	Zechariah	2	2	Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.	38
ASV	Zechariah	2	3	And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,	38
ASV	Zechariah	2	4	and said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, by reason of the multitude of men and cattle therein.	38
ASV	Zechariah	2	5	For I, saith Jehovah, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.	38
ASV	Zechariah	2	6	Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north, saith Jehovah; for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, saith Jehovah.	38
ASV	Zechariah	2	7	Ho Zion, escape, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.	38
ASV	Zechariah	2	8	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: After glory hath he sent me unto the nations which plundered you; for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.	38
ASV	Zechariah	2	9	For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those that served them; and ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me.	38
ASV	Zechariah	2	10	Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith Jehovah.	38
ASV	Zechariah	2	11	And many nations shall join themselves to Jehovah in that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts has sent me unto thee.	38
ASV	Zechariah	2	12	And Jehovah shall inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.	38
ASV	Zechariah	2	13	Be silent, all flesh, before Jehovah; for he is waked up out of his holy habitation.	38
ASV	Zechariah	3	1	And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Jehovah, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary.	38
ASV	Zechariah	3	2	And Jehovah said unto Satan, Jehovah rebuke thee, O Satan; yea, Jehovah that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?	38
ASV	Zechariah	3	3	Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.	38
ASV	Zechariah	3	4	And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take the filthy garments from off him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with rich apparel.	38
ASV	Zechariah	3	5	And I said, Let them set a clean mitre upon his head. So they set a clean mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments; and the angel of Jehovah was standing by.	38
ASV	Zechariah	3	6	And the angel of Jehovah protested unto Joshua, saying,	38
ASV	Zechariah	3	7	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou also shalt judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee a place of access among these that stand by.	38
ASV	Zechariah	3	8	Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee; for they are men that are a sign: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch.	38
ASV	Zechariah	3	9	For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; upon one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.	38
ASV	Zechariah	3	10	In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, shall ye invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig-tree.	38
ASV	Zechariah	4	1	And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep.	38
ASV	Zechariah	4	2	And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have seen, and, behold, a candlestick all of gold, with its bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps thereon; there are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are upon the top thereof;	38
ASV	Zechariah	4	3	and two olive-trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.	38
ASV	Zechariah	4	4	And I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?	38
ASV	Zechariah	4	5	Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these are? And I said, No, my lord.	38
ASV	Zechariah	4	6	Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of Jehovah unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts.	38
ASV	Zechariah	4	7	Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain; and he shall bring forth the top stone with shoutings of Grace, grace, unto it.	38
ASV	Zechariah	4	8	Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	38
ASV	Zechariah	4	9	The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto you.	38
ASV	Zechariah	4	10	For who hath despised the day of small things? for these seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel; these are the eyes of Jehovah, which run to and fro through the whole earth.	38
ASV	Zechariah	4	11	Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive-trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof?	38
ASV	Zechariah	4	12	And I answered the second time, and said unto him, What are these two olive-branches, which are beside the two golden spouts, that empty the golden oil out of themselves?	38
ASV	Zechariah	4	13	And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these are? And I said, No, my lord.	38
ASV	Zechariah	4	14	Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.	38
ASV	Zechariah	5	1	Then again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, a flying roll.	38
ASV	Zechariah	5	2	And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.	38
ASV	Zechariah	5	3	Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole land: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off on the one side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off on the other side according to it.	38
ASV	Zechariah	5	4	I will cause it to go forth, saith Jehovah of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name; and it shall abide in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and	38
ASV	Zechariah	5	5	Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth.	38
ASV	Zechariah	5	6	And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their appearance in all the land;	38
ASV	Zechariah	5	7	(and, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead); and this is a woman sitting in the midst of the ephah.	38
ASV	Zechariah	5	8	And he said, This is Wickedness: and he cast her down into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.	38
ASV	Zechariah	5	9	Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came forth two women, and the wind was in their wings; now they had wings like the wings of a stork; and they lifted up the ephah between earth and heaven.	38
ASV	Zechariah	5	10	Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah?	38
ASV	Zechariah	5	11	And he said unto me, To build her a house in the land of Shinar: and when it is prepared, she shall be set there in her own place.	38
ASV	Zechariah	6	1	And again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.	38
ASV	Zechariah	6	2	In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;	38
ASV	Zechariah	6	3	and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled strong horses.	38
ASV	Zechariah	6	4	Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord?	38
ASV	Zechariah	6	5	And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four winds of heaven, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.	38
ASV	Zechariah	6	6	The chariot wherein are the black horses goeth forth toward the north country; and the white went forth after them; and the grizzled went forth toward the south country.	38
ASV	Zechariah	6	7	And the strong went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.	38
ASV	Zechariah	6	8	Then cried he to me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, they that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.	38
ASV	Zechariah	6	9	And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,	38
ASV	Zechariah	6	10	Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, whither they are come from Babylon;	38
ASV	Zechariah	6	11	yea, take of them silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest;	38
ASV	Zechariah	6	12	and speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, Behold, the man whose name is the Branch: and he shall grow up out of his place; and he shall build the temple of Jehovah;	38
ASV	Zechariah	6	13	even he shall build the temple of Jehovah; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.	38
ASV	Zechariah	6	14	And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah.	38
ASV	Zechariah	6	15	And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of Jehovah; and ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto you. And this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of Jehovah your God.	38
ASV	Zechariah	7	1	And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of Jehovah came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chislev.	38
ASV	Zechariah	7	2	Now they of Beth-el had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to entreat the favor of Jehovah,	38
ASV	Zechariah	7	3	and to speak unto the priests of the house of Jehovah of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?	38
ASV	Zechariah	7	4	Then came the word of Jehovah of hosts unto me, saying,	38
ASV	Zechariah	7	5	Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh month, even these seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?	38
ASV	Zechariah	7	6	And when ye eat, and when ye drink, do not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?	38
ASV	Zechariah	7	7	Should ye not hear the words which Jehovah cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited?	38
ASV	Zechariah	7	8	And the word of Jehovah came unto Zechariah, saying,	38
ASV	Zechariah	7	9	Thus hath Jehovah of hosts spoken, saying, Execute true judgment, and show kindness and compassion every man to his brother;	38
ASV	Zechariah	7	10	and oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the sojourner, nor the poor; and let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart.	38
ASV	Zechariah	7	11	But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they might not hear.	38
ASV	Zechariah	7	12	Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which Jehovah of hosts had sent by his Spirit by the former prophets: therefore there came great wrath from Jehovah of hosts.	38
ASV	Zechariah	7	13	And it is come to pass that, as he cried, and they would not hear, so they shall cry, and I will not hear, said Jehovah of hosts;	38
ASV	Zechariah	7	14	but I will scatter them with a whirlwind among all the nations which they have not known. Thus the land was desolate after them, so that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.	38
ASV	Zechariah	8	1	And the word of Jehovah of hosts came to me, saying,	38
ASV	Zechariah	8	2	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath.	38
ASV	Zechariah	8	3	Thus saith Jehovah: I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called The city of truth; and the mountain of Jehovah of hosts, The holy mountain.	38
ASV	Zechariah	8	4	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, every man with his staff in his hand for very age.	38
ASV	Zechariah	8	5	And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.	38
ASV	Zechariah	8	6	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith Jehovah of hosts.	38
ASV	Zechariah	8	7	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;	38
ASV	Zechariah	8	8	and I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.	38
ASV	Zechariah	8	9	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets that were in the day that the foundation of the house of Jehovah of hosts was laid, even the temple, that it might be built.	38
ASV	Zechariah	8	10	For before those days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in, because of the adversary: for I set all men every one against his neighbor.	38
ASV	Zechariah	8	11	But now I will not be unto the remnant of this people as in the former days, saith Jehovah of hosts.	38
ASV	Zechariah	8	12	For there shall be the seed of peace; the vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.	38
ASV	Zechariah	8	13	And it shall come to pass that, as ye were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing. Fear not, but let your hands be strong.	38
ASV	Zechariah	8	14	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: As I thought to do evil unto you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I repented not;	38
ASV	Zechariah	8	15	so again have I thought in these days to do good unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.	38
ASV	Zechariah	8	16	These are the things that ye shall do: speak ye every man the truth with his neighbor; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates;	38
ASV	Zechariah	8	17	and let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbor; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith Jehovah.	38
ASV	Zechariah	8	18	And the word of Jehovah of hosts came unto me, saying,	38
ASV	Zechariah	8	19	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love truth and peace.	38
ASV	Zechariah	8	20	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come peoples, and the inhabitants of many cities;	38
ASV	Zechariah	8	21	and the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to entreat the favor of Jehovah, and to seek Jehovah of hosts: I will go also.	38
ASV	Zechariah	8	22	Yea, many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek Jehovah of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of Jehovah.	38
ASV	Zechariah	8	23	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold, out of all the languages of the nations, they shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is wit	38
ASV	Zechariah	9	1	The burden of the word of Jehovah upon the land of Hadrach, and Damascus shall be its resting-place (for the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Jehovah);	38
ASV	Zechariah	9	2	and Hamath, also, which bordereth thereon; Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.	38
ASV	Zechariah	9	3	And Tyre did build herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.	38
ASV	Zechariah	9	4	Behold, the Lord will dispossess her, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.	38
ASV	Zechariah	9	5	Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also, and shall be sore pained; and Ekron, for her expectation shall be put to shame; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.	38
ASV	Zechariah	9	6	And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.	38
ASV	Zechariah	9	7	And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth; and he also shall be a remnant for our God; and he shall be as a chieftain in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.	38
ASV	Zechariah	9	8	And I will encamp about my house against the army, that none pass through or return; and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes.	38
ASV	Zechariah	9	9	Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy king cometh unto thee; he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, even upon a colt the foal of an ass.	38
ASV	Zechariah	9	10	And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem; and the battle bow shall be cut off; and he shall speak peace unto the nations: and his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.	38
ASV	Zechariah	9	11	As for thee also, because of the blood of thy covenant I have set free thy prisoners from the pit wherein is no water.	38
ASV	Zechariah	9	12	Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope: even to-day do I declare that I will render double unto thee.	38
ASV	Zechariah	9	13	For I have bent Judah for me, I have filled the bow with Ephraim; and I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and will make thee as the sword of a mighty man.	38
ASV	Zechariah	9	14	And Jehovah shall be seen over them; and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning; and the Lord Jehovah will blow the trumpet, and will go with whirlwinds of the south.	38
ASV	Zechariah	9	15	Jehovah of hosts will defend them; and they shall devour, and shall tread down the sling-stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, like the corners of the altar.	38
ASV	Zechariah	9	16	And Jehovah their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people; for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted on high over his land.	38
ASV	Zechariah	9	17	For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! grain shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins.	38
ASV	Zechariah	10	1	Ask ye of Jehovah rain in the time of the latter rain, even of Jehovah that maketh lightnings; and he will give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.	38
ASV	Zechariah	10	2	For the teraphim have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie; and they have told false dreams, they comfort in vain: therefore they go their way like sheep, they are afflicted, because there is no shepherd.	38
ASV	Zechariah	10	3	Mine anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the he-goats; for Jehovah of hosts hath visited his flock, the house of Judah, and will make them as his goodly horse in the battle.	38
ASV	Zechariah	10	4	From him shall come forth the corner-stone, from him the nail, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler together.	38
ASV	Zechariah	10	5	And they shall be as mighty men, treading down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle; and they shall fight, because Jehovah is with them; and the riders on horses shall be confounded.	38
ASV	Zechariah	10	6	And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them back; for I have mercy upon them; and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am Jehovah their God, and I will hear them.	38
ASV	Zechariah	10	7	And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine; yea, their children shall see it, and rejoice; their heart shall be glad in Jehovah.	38
ASV	Zechariah	10	8	I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them; and they shall increase as they have increased.	38
ASV	Zechariah	10	9	And I will sow them among the peoples; and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and shall return.	38
ASV	Zechariah	10	10	I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for them.	38
ASV	Zechariah	10	11	And he will pass through the sea of affliction, and will smite the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the Nile shall dry up; and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart.	38
ASV	Zechariah	10	12	And I will strengthen them in Jehovah; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith Jehovah.	38
ASV	Zechariah	11	1	Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.	38
ASV	Zechariah	11	2	Wail, O fir-tree, for the cedar is fallen, because the goodly ones are destroyed: wail, O ye oaks of Bashan, for the strong forest is come down.	38
ASV	Zechariah	11	3	A voice of the wailing of the shepherds! for their glory is destroyed: a voice of the roaring of young lions! for the pride of the Jordan is laid waste.	38
ASV	Zechariah	11	4	Thus said Jehovah my God: Feed the flock of slaughter;	38
ASV	Zechariah	11	5	whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty; and they that sell them say, Blessed be Jehovah, for I am rich; and their own shepherds pity them not.	38
ASV	Zechariah	11	6	For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah; but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbors hand, and into the hand of his king; and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.	38
ASV	Zechariah	11	7	So I fed the flock of slaughter, verily the poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.	38
ASV	Zechariah	11	8	And I cut off the three shepherds in one month; for my soul was weary of them, and their soul also loathed me.	38
ASV	Zechariah	11	9	Then said I, I will not feed you: that which dieth, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let them that are left eat every one the flesh of another.	38
ASV	Zechariah	11	10	And I took my staff Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.	38
ASV	Zechariah	11	11	And it was broken in that day; and thus the poor of the flock that gave heed unto me knew that it was the word of Jehovah.	38
ASV	Zechariah	11	12	And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my hire; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my hire thirty pieces of silver.	38
ASV	Zechariah	11	13	And Jehovah said unto me, Cast it unto the potter, the goodly price that I was prized at by them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them unto the potter, in the house of Jehovah.	38
ASV	Zechariah	11	14	Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.	38
ASV	Zechariah	11	15	And Jehovah said unto me, Take unto thee yet again the instruments of a foolish shepherd.	38
ASV	Zechariah	11	16	For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not visit those that are cut off, neither will seek those that are scattered, nor heal that which is broken, nor feed that which is sound; but he will eat the flesh of the fat sheep, and will tear	38
ASV	Zechariah	11	17	Woe to the worthless shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.	38
ASV	Zechariah	12	1	The burden of the word of Jehovah concerning Israel. Thus saith Jehovah, who stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him:	38
ASV	Zechariah	12	2	behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling unto all the peoples round about, and upon Judah also shall it be in the siege against Jerusalem.	38
ASV	Zechariah	12	3	And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples; all that burden themselves with it shall be sore wounded; and all the nations of the earth shall be gathered together against it.	38
ASV	Zechariah	12	4	In that day, saith Jehovah, I will smite every horse with terror, and his rider with madness; and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the peoples with blindness.	38
ASV	Zechariah	12	5	And the chieftains of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in Jehovah of hosts their God.	38
ASV	Zechariah	12	6	In that day will I make the chieftains of Judah like a pan of fire among wood, and like a flaming torch among sheaves; and they shall devour all the peoples round about, on the right hand and on the left; and they of Jerusalem shall yet again dwell in the	38
ASV	Zechariah	12	7	Jehovah also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem be not magnified above Judah.	38
ASV	Zechariah	12	8	In that day shall Jehovah defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of Jehovah before them.	38
ASV	Zechariah	12	9	And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.	38
ASV	Zechariah	12	10	And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication; and they shall look unto me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bi	38
ASV	Zechariah	12	11	In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.	38
ASV	Zechariah	12	12	And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;	38
ASV	Zechariah	12	13	the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of the Shimeites apart, and their wives apart;	38
ASV	Zechariah	12	14	all the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.	38
ASV	Zechariah	13	1	In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.	38
ASV	Zechariah	13	2	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered; and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.	38
ASV	Zechariah	13	3	And it shall come to pass that, when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of Jehovah; and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust hi	38
ASV	Zechariah	13	4	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he prophesieth; neither shall they wear a hairy mantle to deceive:	38
ASV	Zechariah	13	5	but he shall say, I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondman from my youth.	38
ASV	Zechariah	13	6	And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds between thine arms? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.	38
ASV	Zechariah	13	7	Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith Jehovah of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered; and I will turn my hand upon the little ones.	38
ASV	Zechariah	13	8	And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith Jehovah, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.	38
ASV	Zechariah	13	9	And I will bring the third part into the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people; and they shall say, Jehovah is my God.	38
ASV	Zechariah	14	1	Behold, a day of Jehovah cometh, when thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee.	38
ASV	Zechariah	14	2	For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.	38
ASV	Zechariah	14	3	Then shall Jehovah go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.	38
ASV	Zechariah	14	4	And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the mount of Olives shall be cleft in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the	38
ASV	Zechariah	14	5	And ye shall flee by the valley of my mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azel; yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah; and Jehovah my God shall come, and all the holy one	38
ASV	Zechariah	14	6	And it shall come to pass in that day, that there shall not be light; the bright ones shall withdraw themselves:	38
ASV	Zechariah	14	7	but it shall be one day which is known unto Jehovah; not day, and not night; but it shall come to pass, that at evening time there shall be light.	38
ASV	Zechariah	14	8	And it shall come to pass in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.	38
ASV	Zechariah	14	9	And Jehovah shall be King over all the earth: in that day shall Jehovah be one, and his name one.	38
ASV	Zechariah	14	10	All the land shall be made like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and she shall be lifted up, and shall dwell in her place, from Benjamins gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel unto th	38
ASV	Zechariah	14	11	And men shall dwell therein, and there shall be no more curse; but Jerusalem shall dwell safely.	38
ASV	Zechariah	14	12	And this shall be the plague wherewith Jehovah will smite all the peoples that have warred against Jerusalem: their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their sockets, and their tongue shall consu	38
ASV	Zechariah	14	13	And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from Jehovah shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor.	38
ASV	Zechariah	14	14	And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the nations round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.	38
ASV	Zechariah	14	15	And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in those camps, as that plague.	38
ASV	Zechariah	14	16	And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.	38
ASV	Zechariah	14	17	And it shall be, that whoso of all the families of the earth goeth not up unto Jerusalem to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, upon them there shall be no rain.	38
ASV	Zechariah	14	18	And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, neither shall it be upon them; there shall be the plague wherewith Jehovah will smite the nations that go not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.	38
ASV	Zechariah	14	19	This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations that go not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.	38
ASV	Zechariah	14	20	In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLY UNTO JEHOVAH; and the pots in Jehovahs house shall be like the bowls before the altar.	38
ASV	Zechariah	14	21	Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holy unto Jehovah of hosts; and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and boil therein: and in that day there shall be no more a Canaanite in the house of Jehovah of hosts.	38
ASV	Malachi	1	1	The burden of the word of Jehovah to Israel by Malachi.	39
ASV	Malachi	1	2	I have loved you, saith Jehovah. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacobs brother, saith Jehovah: yet I loved Jacob;	39
ASV	Malachi	1	3	but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.	39
ASV	Malachi	1	4	Whereas Edom saith, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places; thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and men shall call them The border of wickedness, and The people against whom Jehovah hath indigna	39
ASV	Malachi	1	5	And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, Jehovah be magnified beyond the border of Israel.	39
ASV	Malachi	1	6	A son honoreth his father, and a servant his master: if then I am a father, where is mine honor? and if I am a master, where is my fear? saith Jehovah of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?	39
ASV	Malachi	1	7	Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar. And ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of Jehovah is contemptible.	39
ASV	Malachi	1	8	And when ye offer the blind for sacrifice, it is no evil! and when ye offer the lame and sick, it is no evil! Present it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee? or will he accept thy person? saith Jehovah of hosts.	39
ASV	Malachi	1	9	And now, I pray you, entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he accept any of your persons? saith Jehovah of hosts.	39
ASV	Malachi	1	10	Oh that there were one among you that would shut the doors, that ye might not kindle fire on mine altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, saith Jehovah of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.	39
ASV	Malachi	1	11	For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the Gentiles, saith Jehovah of h	39
ASV	Malachi	1	12	But ye profane it, in that ye say, The table of Jehovah is polluted, and the fruit thereof, even its food, is contemptible.	39
ASV	Malachi	1	13	Ye say also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith Jehovah of hosts; and ye have brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye bring the offering: should I accept this at your hand? saith Jehovah.	39
ASV	Malachi	1	14	But cursed be the deceiver, who hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great King, saith Jehovah of hosts, and my name is terrible among the Gentiles.	39
ASV	Malachi	2	1	And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.	39
ASV	Malachi	2	2	If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith Jehovah of hosts, then will I send the curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings; yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart.	39
ASV	Malachi	2	3	Behold, I will rebuke your seed, and will spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your feasts; and ye shall be taken away with it.	39
ASV	Malachi	2	4	And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant may be with Levi, saith Jehovah of hosts.	39
ASV	Malachi	2	5	My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him that he might fear; and he feared me, and stood in awe of my name.	39
ASV	Malachi	2	6	The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity.	39
ASV	Malachi	2	7	For the priests lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of Jehovah of hosts.	39
ASV	Malachi	2	8	But ye are turned aside out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble in the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith Jehovah of hosts.	39
ASV	Malachi	2	9	Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have had respect of persons in the law.	39
ASV	Malachi	2	10	Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?	39
ASV	Malachi	2	11	Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of Jehovah which he loveth, and hath married the daughter of a foreign god.	39
ASV	Malachi	2	12	Jehovah will cut off, to the man that doeth this, him that waketh and him that answereth, out of the tents of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto Jehovah of hosts.	39
ASV	Malachi	2	13	And this again ye do: ye cover the altar of Jehovah with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, neither receiveth it with good will at your hand.	39
ASV	Malachi	2	14	Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because Jehovah hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously, though she is thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.	39
ASV	Malachi	2	15	And did he not make one, although he had the residue of the Spirit? And wherefore one? He sought a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.	39
ASV	Malachi	2	16	For I hate putting away, saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, and him that covereth his garment with violence, saith Jehovah of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.	39
ASV	Malachi	2	17	Ye have wearied Jehovah with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him? In that ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of Jehovah, and he delighteth in them; or where is the God of justice?	39
ASV	Malachi	3	1	Behold, I send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant, whom ye desire, behold, he cometh, saith Jehovah of hosts.	39
ASV	Malachi	3	2	But who can abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiners fire, and like fullers soap:	39
ASV	Malachi	3	3	and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver; and they shall offer unto Jehovah offerings in righteousness.	39
ASV	Malachi	3	4	Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.	39
ASV	Malachi	3	5	And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against the false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that tur	39
ASV	Malachi	3	6	For I, Jehovah, change not; therefore ye, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed.	39
ASV	Malachi	3	7	From the days of your fathers ye have turned aside from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith Jehovah of hosts. But ye say, Wherein shall we return?	39
ASV	Malachi	3	8	Will a man rob God? yet ye rob me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.	39
ASV	Malachi	3	9	Ye are cursed with the curse; for ye rob me, even this whole nation.	39
ASV	Malachi	3	10	Bring ye the whole tithe into the store-house, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive	39
ASV	Malachi	3	11	And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before the time in the field, saith Jehovah of hosts.	39
ASV	Malachi	3	12	And all nations shall call you happy; for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith Jehovah of hosts.	39
ASV	Malachi	3	13	Your words have been stout against me, saith Jehovah. Yet ye say, What have we spoken against thee?	39
ASV	Malachi	3	14	Ye have said, It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept his charge, and that we have walked mournfully before Jehovah of hosts?	39
ASV	Malachi	3	15	And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are built up; yea, they tempt God, and escape.	39
ASV	Malachi	3	16	Then they that feared Jehovah spake one with another; and Jehovah hearkened, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before him, for them that feared Jehovah, and that thought upon his name.	39
ASV	Malachi	3	17	And they shall be mine, saith Jehovah of hosts, even mine own possession, in the day that I make; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.	39
ASV	Malachi	3	18	Then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.	39
ASV	Malachi	4	1	For, behold, the day cometh, it burneth as a furnace; and all the proud, and all that work wickedness, shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith Jehovah of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.	39
ASV	Malachi	4	2	But unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings; and ye shall go forth, and gambol as calves of the stall.	39
ASV	Malachi	4	3	And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I make, saith Jehovah of hosts.	39
ASV	Malachi	4	4	Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances.	39
ASV	Malachi	4	5	Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of Jehovah come.	39
ASV	Malachi	4	6	And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers; lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.	39
