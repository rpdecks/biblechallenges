NASB	1 Corinthians	1	1	Paul, called as an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	10	Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	11	For I have been informed concerning you, my brethren, by Chloe&rsquo;s people, that there are quarrels among you.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	12	Now I mean this, that each one of you is saying, &ldquo;I am of Paul,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I of Apollos,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I of Cephas,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I of Christ.&rdquo;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	13	Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	14	I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	15	So that no one would say you were baptized in my name.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	16	Now I did baptize also the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized any other.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	17	For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not in cleverness of speech, so that the cross of Christ would not be made void.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	18	For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	19	For it is written, &ldquo;I WILL DESTROY THE WISDOM OF THE WISE, AND THE CLEVERNESS OF THE CLEVER I WILL SET ASIDE.&rdquo;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	2	To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, saints by calling, with all who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours:	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	20	Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	21	For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not come to know God, God was well-pleased through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	22	For indeed Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	23	But we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	24	But to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	25	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	26	For consider your calling, brethren, that there were not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	27	But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	28	And the base things of the world and the despised God has chosen, the things that are not, so that He may nullify the things that are,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	29	So that no man may boast before God.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	30	But by His doing you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	31	So that, just as it is written, &ldquo;LET HIM WHO BOASTS, BOAST IN THE LORD.&rdquo;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	4	I thank my God always concerning you for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	5	That in everything you were enriched in Him, in all speech and all knowledge,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	6	Even as the testimony concerning Christ was confirmed in you,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	7	So that you are not lacking in any gift, awaiting eagerly the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	8	Who will also confirm you to the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	1	9	God is faithful, through whom you were called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	1	For I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	10	Nor grumble, as some of them did, and were destroyed by the destroyer.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	11	Now these things happened to them as an example, and they were written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	12	Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed that he does not fall.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	13	No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man; and God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you will be able to endure it.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	14	Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	15	I speak as to wise men; you judge what I say.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	16	Is not the cup of blessing which we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ? Is not the bread which we break a sharing in the body of Christ?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	17	Since there is one bread, we who are many are one body; for we all partake of the one bread.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	18	Look at the nation Israel; are not those who eat the sacrifices sharers in the altar?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	19	What do I mean then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	2	And all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	20	No, but I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not want you to become sharers in demons.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	21	You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	22	Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? We are not stronger than He, are we?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	23	All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful, but not all things edify.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	24	Let no one seek his own good, but that of his neighbor.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	25	Eat anything that is sold in the meat market without asking questions for conscience&rsquo; sake;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	26	FOR THE EARTH IS THE LORD&rsquo;s, AND ALL IT CONTAINS.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	27	If one of the unbelievers invites you and you want to go, eat anything that is set before you without asking questions for conscience&rsquo; sake.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	28	But if anyone says to you, &ldquo;This is meat sacrificed to idols,&rdquo; do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for conscience&rsquo; sake;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	29	I mean not your own conscience, but the other man&rsquo;s; for why is my freedom judged by another&rsquo;s conscience?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	3	And all ate the same spiritual food;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	30	If I partake with thankfulness, why am I slandered concerning that for which I give thanks?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	31	Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	32	Give no offense either to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	33	Just as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit but the profit of the many, so that they may be saved.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	4	And all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	5	Nevertheless, with most of them God was not well-pleased; for they were laid low in the wilderness.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	6	Now these things happened as examples for us, so that we would not crave evil things as they also craved.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	7	Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written, &ldquo;THE PEOPLE SAT DOWN TO EAT AND DRINK, AND STOOD UP TO PLAY.&rdquo;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	8	Nor let us act immorally, as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in one day.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	10	9	Nor let us try the Lord, as some of them did, and were destroyed by the serpents.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	1	Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	10	Therefore the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	11	However, in the Lord, neither is woman independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	12	For as the woman originates from the man, so also the man has his birth through the woman; and all things originate from God.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	13	Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	14	Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	15	But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? For her hair is given to her for a covering.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	16	But if one is inclined to be contentious, we have no other practice, nor have the churches of God.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	17	But in giving this instruction, I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	18	For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and in part I believe it.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	19	For there must also be factions among you, so that those who are approved may become evident among you.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	2	Now I praise you because you remember me in everything and hold firmly to the traditions, just as I delivered them to you.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	20	Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord&rsquo;s Supper,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	21	For in your eating each one takes his own supper first; and one is hungry and another is drunk.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	22	What! Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I will not praise you.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	23	For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	24	And when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, &ldquo;This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.&rdquo;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	25	In the same way He took the cup also after supper, saying, &ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.&rdquo;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	26	For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord&rsquo;s death until He comes.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	27	Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	28	But a man must examine himself, and in so doing he is to eat of the bread and drink of the cup.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	29	For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not judge the body rightly.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	3	But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	30	For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	31	But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	32	But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	33	So then, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	34	If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that you will not come together for judgment. The remaining matters I will arrange when I come.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	4	Every man who has something on his head while praying or prophesying disgraces his head.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	5	But every woman who has her head uncovered while praying or prophesying disgraces her head, for she is one and the same as the woman whose head is shaved.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	6	For if a woman does not cover her head, let her also have her hair cut off; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, let her cover her head.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	7	For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	8	For man does not originate from woman, but woman from man;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	11	9	For indeed man was not created for the woman&rsquo;s sake, but woman for the man&rsquo;s sake.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	1	Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to be unaware.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	10	And to another the effecting of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another the distinguishing of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	11	But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	12	For even as the body is one and yet has many members, and all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is Christ.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	13	For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	14	For the body is not one member, but many.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	15	If the foot says, &ldquo;Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body,&rdquo; it is not for this reason any the less a part of the body.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	16	And if the ear says, &ldquo;Because I am not an eye, I am not a part of the body,&rdquo; it is not for this reason any the less a part of the body.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	18	But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, just as He desired.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	19	If they were all one member, where would the body be?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	2	You know that when you were pagans, you were led astray to the mute idols, however you were led.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	20	But now there are many members, but one body.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	21	And the eye cannot say to the hand, &ldquo;I have no need of you&rdquo;; or again the head to the feet, &ldquo;I have no need of you.&rdquo;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	22	On the contrary, it is much truer that the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	23	And those members of the body which we deem less honorable, on these we bestow more abundant honor, and our less presentable members become much more presentable,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	24	Whereas our more presentable members have no need of it. But God has so composed the body, giving more abundant honor to that member which lacked,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	25	So that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	26	And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	27	Now you are Christ&rsquo;s body, and individually members of it.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	28	And God has appointed in the church, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	29	All are not apostles, are they? All are not prophets, are they? All are not teachers, are they? All are not workers of miracles, are they?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	3	Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, &ldquo;Jesus is accursed&rdquo;; and no one can say, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord,&rdquo; except by the Holy Spirit.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	30	All do not have gifts of healings, do they? All do not speak with tongues, do they? All do not interpret, do they?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	31	But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And I show you a still more excellent way.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	4	Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	5	And there are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	6	There are varieties of effects, but the same God who works all things in all persons.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	7	But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	8	For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	12	9	To another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	13	1	If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	13	10	But when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child, I used to speak like a child, think like a child, reason like a child; when I became a man, I did away with childish things.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	13	12	For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I also have been fully known.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	13	13	But now faith, hope, love, abide these three; but the greatest of these is love.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	13	2	If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	13	3	And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	13	4	Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	13	5	Does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	13	6	Does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	13	7	Bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	13	8	Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be done away.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	13	9	For we know in part and we prophesy in part;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	1	Pursue love, yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	10	There are, perhaps, a great many kinds of languages in the world, and no kind is without meaning.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	11	If then I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be to the one who speaks a barbarian, and the one who speaks will be a barbarian to me.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	12	So also you, since you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek to abound for the edification of the church.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	13	Therefore let one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	14	For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	15	What is the outcome then? I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind also; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	16	Otherwise if you bless in the spirit only, how will the one who fills the place of the ungifted say the &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you are saying?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	17	For you are giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not edified.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	18	I thank God, I speak in tongues more than you all;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	19	However, in the church I desire to speak five words with my mind so that I may instruct others also, rather than ten thousand words in a tongue.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	2	For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God; for no one understands, but in his spirit he speaks mysteries.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	20	Brethren, do not be children in your thinking; yet in evil be infants, but in your thinking be mature.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	21	In the Law it is written, &ldquo;BY MEN OF STRANGE TONGUES AND BY THE LIPS OF STRANGERS I WILL SPEAK TO THIS PEOPLE, AND EVEN SO THEY WILL NOT LISTEN TO ME,&rdquo; says the Lord.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	22	So then tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophecy is for a sign, not to unbelievers but to those who believe.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	23	Therefore if the whole church assembles together and all speak in tongues, and ungifted men or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are mad?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	24	But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an ungifted man enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	25	The secrets of his heart are disclosed; and so he will fall on his face and worship God, declaring that God is certainly among you.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	26	What is the outcome then, brethren? When you assemble, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	27	If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by two or at the most three, and each in turn, and one must interpret;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	28	But if there is no interpreter, he must keep silent in the church; and let him speak to himself and to God.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	29	Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others pass judgment.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	3	But one who prophesies speaks to men for edification and exhortation and consolation.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	30	But if a revelation is made to another who is seated, the first one must keep silent.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	31	For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all may be exhorted;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	32	And the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	33	For God is not a God of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	34	The women are to keep silent in the churches; for they are not permitted to speak, but are to subject themselves, just as the Law also says.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	35	If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is improper for a woman to speak in church.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	36	Was it from you that the word of God first went forth? Or has it come to you only?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	37	If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I write to you are the Lord&rsquo;s commandment.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	38	But if anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	39	Therefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak in tongues.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	4	One who speaks in a tongue edifies himself; but one who prophesies edifies the church.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	40	But all things must be done properly and in an orderly manner.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	5	Now I wish that you all spoke in tongues, but even more that you would prophesy; and greater is one who prophesies than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may receive edifying.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	6	But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I profit you unless I speak to you either by way of revelation or of knowledge or of prophecy or of teaching?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	7	Yet even lifeless things, either flute or harp, in producing a sound, if they do not produce a distinction in the tones, how will it be known what is played on the flute or on the harp?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	8	For if the bugle produces an indistinct sound, who will prepare himself for battle?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	14	9	So also you, unless you utter by the tongue speech that is clear, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	1	Now I make known to you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	10	But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me did not prove vain; but I labored even more than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	11	Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	12	Now if Christ is preached, that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	13	But if there is no resurrection of the dead, not even Christ has been raised;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	14	And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain, your faith also is vain.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	15	Moreover we are even found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise, if in fact the dead are not raised.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	16	For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	17	And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	18	Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	19	If we have hoped in Christ in this life only, we are of all men most to be pitied.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	2	By which also you are saved, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	20	But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who are asleep.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	21	For since by a man came death, by a man also came the resurrection of the dead.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	22	For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	23	But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, after that those who are Christ&rsquo;s at His coming,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	24	Then comes the end, when He hands over the kingdom to the God and Father, when He has abolished all rule and all authority and power.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	25	For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy that will be abolished is death.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	27	For HE HAS PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIS FEET. But when He says, &ldquo;All things are put in subjection,&rdquo; it is evident that He is excepted who put all things in subjection to Him.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	28	When all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subjected to the One who subjected all things to Him, so that God may be all in all.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	29	Otherwise, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	3	For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	30	Why are we also in danger every hour?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	31	I affirm, brethren, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	32	If from human motives I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, LET US EAT AND DRINK, FOR TOMORROW WE DIE.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	33	Do not be deceived: &ldquo;Bad company corrupts good morals.&rdquo;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	34	Become sober-minded as you ought, and stop sinning; for some have no knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	35	But someone will say, &ldquo;How are the dead raised? And with what kind of body do they come?&rdquo;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	36	You fool! That which you sow does not come to life unless it dies;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	37	And that which you sow, you do not sow the body which is to be, but a bare grain, perhaps of wheat or of something else.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	38	But God gives it a body just as He wished, and to each of the seeds a body of its own.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	39	All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fish.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	4	And that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	40	There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is one, and the glory of the earthly is another.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	41	There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	42	So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown a perishable body, it is raised an imperishable body;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	43	It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	44	It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	45	So also it is written, &ldquo;The first MAN, Adam, BECAME A LIVING SOUL.&rdquo; The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	46	However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural; then the spiritual.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	47	The first man is from the earth, earthy; the second man is from heaven.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	48	As is the earthy, so also are those who are earthy; and as is the heavenly, so also are those who are heavenly.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	49	Just as we have borne the image of the earthy, we will also bear the image of the heavenly.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	5	And that He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	50	Now I say this, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	51	Behold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	52	In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	53	For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	54	But when this perishable will have put on the imperishable, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then will come about the saying that is written, &ldquo;DEATH IS SWALLOWED UP in victory.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	55	&ldquo;O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY? O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR STING?&rdquo;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	56	The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	57	But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	58	Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not in vain in the Lord.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	6	After that He appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	7	Then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	8	And last of all, as to one untimely born, He appeared to me also.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	15	9	For I am the least of the apostles, and not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	1	Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so do you also.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	10	Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without cause to be afraid, for he is doing the Lord&rsquo;s work, as I also am.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	11	So let no one despise him. But send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brethren.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	12	But concerning Apollos our brother, I encouraged him greatly to come to you with the brethren; and it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	13	Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	14	Let all that you do be done in love.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	15	Now I urge you, brethren (you know the household of Stephanas, that they were the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves for ministry to the saints),	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	16	That you also be in subjection to such men and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	17	I rejoice over the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have supplied what was lacking on your part.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	18	For they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge such men.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	19	The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Prisca greet you heartily in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	2	On the first day of every week each one of you is to put aside and save, as he may prosper, so that no collections be made when I come.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	20	All the brethren greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	21	The greeting is in my own hand&mdash;Paul.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	22	If anyone does not love the Lord, he is to be accursed. Maranatha.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	23	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	24	My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	3	When I arrive, whomever you may approve, I will send them with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	4	And if it is fitting for me to go also, they will go with me.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	5	But I will come to you after I go through Macedonia, for I am going through Macedonia;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	6	And perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, so that you may send me on my way wherever I may go.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	7	For I do not wish to see you now just in passing; for I hope to remain with you for some time, if the Lord permits.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	8	But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	16	9	For a wide door for effective service has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	2	1	And when I came to you, brethren, I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	2	10	For to us God revealed them through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	2	11	For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so the thoughts of God no one knows except the Spirit of God.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	2	12	Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	2	13	Which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	2	14	But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	2	15	But he who is spiritual appraises all things, yet he himself is appraised by no one.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	2	16	For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	2	2	For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	2	3	I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	2	4	And my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	2	5	So that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	2	6	Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature; a wisdom, however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	2	7	But we speak God&rsquo;s wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God predestined before the ages to our glory;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	2	8	The wisdom which none of the rulers of this age has understood; for if they had understood it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	2	9	But just as it is written, &ldquo;THINGS WHICH EYE HAS NOT SEEN AND EAR HAS NOT HEARD, AND which HAVE NOT ENTERED THE HEART OF MAN, ALL THAT GOD HAS PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HIM.&rdquo;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	3	1	And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	3	10	According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building on it. But each man must be careful how he builds on it.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	3	11	For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	3	12	Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	3	13	Each man&rsquo;s work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man&rsquo;s work.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	3	14	If any man&rsquo;s work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	3	15	If any man&rsquo;s work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	3	16	Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	3	17	If any man destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him, for the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	3	18	Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you thinks that he is wise in this age, he must become foolish, so that he may become wise.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	3	19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness before God. For it is written, &ldquo;He is THE ONE WHO CATCHES THE WISE IN THEIR CRAFTINESS&rdquo;;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	3	2	I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you are not yet able,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	3	20	And again, &ldquo;THE LORD KNOWS THE REASONINGS of the wise, THAT THEY ARE USELESS.&rdquo;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	3	21	So then let no one boast in men. For all things belong to you,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	3	22	Whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come; all things belong to you,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	3	23	And you belong to Christ; and Christ belongs to God.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	3	3	For you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere men?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	3	4	For when one says, &ldquo;I am of Paul,&rdquo; and another, &ldquo;I am of Apollos,&rdquo; are you not mere men?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	3	5	What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave opportunity to each one.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	3	6	I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	3	7	So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who causes the growth.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	3	8	Now he who plants and he who waters are one; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	3	9	For we are God&rsquo;s fellow workers; you are God&rsquo;s field, God&rsquo;s building.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	4	1	Let a man regard us in this manner, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	4	10	We are fools for Christ&rsquo;s sake, but you are prudent in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are distinguished, but we are without honor.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	4	11	To this present hour we are both hungry and thirsty, and are poorly clothed, and are roughly treated, and are homeless;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	4	12	And we toil, working with our own hands; when we are reviled, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	4	13	When we are slandered, we try to conciliate; we have become as the scum of the world, the dregs of all things, even until now.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	4	14	I do not write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	4	15	For if you were to have countless tutors in Christ, yet you would not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	4	16	Therefore I exhort you, be imitators of me.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	4	17	For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, and he will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every church.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	4	18	Now some have become arrogant, as though I were not coming to you.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	4	19	But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I shall find out, not the words of those who are arrogant but their power.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	4	2	In this case, moreover, it is required of stewards that one be found trustworthy.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	4	20	For the kingdom of God does not consist in words but in power.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	4	21	What do you desire? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love and a spirit of gentleness?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	4	3	But to me it is a very small thing that I may be examined by you, or by any human court; in fact, I do not even examine myself.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	4	4	For I am conscious of nothing against myself, yet I am not by this acquitted; but the one who examines me is the Lord.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	4	5	Therefore do not go on passing judgment before the time, but wait until the Lord comes who will both bring to light the things hidden in the darkness and disclose the motives of men&rsquo;s hearts; and then each man&rsquo;s praise will come to him from God.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	4	6	Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that in us you may learn not to exceed what is written, so that no one of you will become arrogant in behalf of one against the other.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	4	7	For who regards you as superior? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	4	8	You are already filled, you have already become rich, you have become kings without us; and indeed, I wish that you had become kings so that we also might reign with you.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	4	9	For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles last of all, as men condemned to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	5	1	It is actually reported that there is immorality among you, and immorality of such a kind as does not exist even among the Gentiles, that someone has his father&rsquo;s wife.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	5	10	I did not at all mean with the immoral people of this world, or with the covetous and swindlers, or with idolaters, for then you would have to go out of the world.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	5	11	But actually, I wrote to you not to associate with any so-called brother if he is an immoral person, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindler&mdash;not even to eat with such a one.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	5	12	For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Do you not judge those who are within the church?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	5	13	But those who are outside, God judges. REMOVE THE WICKED MAN FROM AMONG YOURSELVES.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	5	2	You have become arrogant and have not mourned instead, so that the one who had done this deed would be removed from your midst.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	5	3	For I, on my part, though absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged him who has so committed this, as though I were present.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	5	4	In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled, and I with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	5	5	I have decided to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	5	6	Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	5	7	Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, just as you are in fact unleavened. For Christ our Passover also has been sacrificed.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	5	8	Therefore let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	5	9	I wrote you in my letter not to associate with immoral people;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	6	1	Does any one of you, when he has a case against his neighbor, dare to go to law before the unrighteous and not before the saints?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	6	10	Nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	6	11	Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	6	12	All things are lawful for me, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be mastered by anything.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	6	13	Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food, but God will do away with both of them. Yet the body is not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	6	14	Now God has not only raised the Lord, but will also raise us up through His power.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	6	15	Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take away the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be!	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	6	16	Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For He says, &ldquo;THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH.&rdquo;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	6	17	But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with Him.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	6	18	Flee immorality. Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body, but the immoral man sins against his own body.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	6	19	Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	6	2	Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? If the world is judged by you, are you not competent to constitute the smallest law courts?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	6	20	For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	6	3	Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more matters of this life?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	6	4	So if you have law courts dealing with matters of this life, do you appoint them as judges who are of no account in the church?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	6	5	I say this to your shame. Is it so, that there is not among you one wise man who will be able to decide between his brethren,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	6	6	But brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	6	7	Actually, then, it is already a defeat for you, that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	6	8	On the contrary, you yourselves wrong and defraud. You do this even to your brethren.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	6	9	Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	1	Now concerning the things about which you wrote, it is good for a man not to touch a woman.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	10	But to the married I give instructions, not I, but the Lord, that the wife should not leave her husband	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	11	(but if she does leave, she must remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband should not divorce his wife.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	12	But to the rest I say, not the Lord, that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he must not divorce her.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	13	And a woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he consents to live with her, she must not send her husband away.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband; for otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	15	Yet if the unbelieving one leaves, let him leave; the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us to peace.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	16	For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	17	Only, as the Lord has assigned to each one, as God has called each, in this manner let him walk. And so I direct in all the churches.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	18	Was any man called when he was already circumcised? He is not to become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? He is not to be circumcised.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	19	Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but what matters is the keeping of the commandments of God.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	2	But because of immoralities, each man is to have his own wife, and each woman is to have her own husband.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	20	Each man must remain in that condition in which he was called.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	21	Were you called while a slave? Do not worry about it; but if you are able also to become free, rather do that.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	22	For he who was called in the Lord while a slave, is the Lord&rsquo;s freedman; likewise he who was called while free, is Christ&rsquo;s slave.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	23	You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of men.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	24	Brethren, each one is to remain with God in that condition in which he was called.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	25	Now concerning virgins I have no command of the Lord, but I give an opinion as one who by the mercy of the Lord is trustworthy.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	26	I think then that this is good in view of the present distress, that it is good for a man to remain as he is.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	27	Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Are you released from a wife? Do not seek a wife.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	28	But if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such will have trouble in this life, and I am trying to spare you.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	29	But this I say, brethren, the time has been shortened, so that from now on those who have wives should be as though they had none;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	3	The husband must fulfill his duty to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	30	And those who weep, as though they did not weep; and those who rejoice, as though they did not rejoice; and those who buy, as though they did not possess;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	31	And those who use the world, as though they did not make full use of it; for the form of this world is passing away.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	32	But I want you to be free from concern. One who is unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	33	But one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	34	And his interests are divided. The woman who is unmarried, and the virgin, is concerned about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how she may please her husband.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	35	This I say for your own benefit; not to put a restraint upon you, but to promote what is appropriate and to secure undistracted devotion to the Lord.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	36	But if any man thinks that he is acting unbecomingly toward his virgin daughter, if she is past her youth, and if it must be so, let him do what he wishes, he does not sin; let her marry.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	37	But he who stands firm in his heart, being under no constraint, but has authority over his own will, and has decided this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin daughter, he will do well.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	38	So then both he who gives his own virgin daughter in marriage does well, and he who does not give her in marriage will do better.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	39	A wife is bound as long as her husband lives; but if her husband is dead, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	4	The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; and likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	40	But in my opinion she is happier if she remains as she is; and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	5	Stop depriving one another, except by agreement for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	6	But this I say by way of concession, not of command.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	7	Yet I wish that all men were even as I myself am. However, each man has his own gift from God, one in this manner, and another in that.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	8	But I say to the unmarried and to widows that it is good for them if they remain even as I.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	7	9	But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	8	1	Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge makes arrogant, but love edifies.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	8	10	For if someone sees you, who have knowledge, dining in an idol&rsquo;s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be strengthened to eat things sacrificed to idols?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	8	11	For through your knowledge he who is weak is ruined, the brother for whose sake Christ died.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	8	12	And so, by sinning against the brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	8	13	Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause my brother to stumble.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	8	2	If anyone supposes that he knows anything, he has not yet known as he ought to know;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	8	3	But if anyone loves God, he is known by Him.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	8	4	Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that there is no such thing as an idol in the world, and that there is no God but one.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	8	5	For even if there are so-called gods whether in heaven or on earth, as indeed there are many gods and many lords,	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	8	6	Yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things and we exist for Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we exist through Him.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	8	7	However not all men have this knowledge; but some, being accustomed to the idol until now, eat food as if it were sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	8	8	But food will not commend us to God; we are neither the worse if we do not eat, nor the better if we do eat.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	8	9	But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	1	Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	10	Or is He speaking altogether for our sake? Yes, for our sake it was written, because the plowman ought to plow in hope, and the thresher to thresh in hope of sharing the crops.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	11	If we sowed spiritual things in you, is it too much if we reap material things from you?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	12	If others share the right over you, do we not more? Nevertheless, we did not use this right, but we endure all things so that we will cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	13	Do you not know that those who perform sacred services eat the food of the temple, and those who attend regularly to the altar have their share from the altar?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	14	So also the Lord directed those who proclaim the gospel to get their living from the gospel.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	15	But I have used none of these things. And I am not writing these things so that it will be done so in my case; for it would be better for me to die than have any man make my boast an empty one.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	16	For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for I am under compulsion; for woe is me if I do not preach the gospel.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	17	For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward; but if against my will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	18	What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may offer the gospel without charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	19	For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a slave to all, so that I may win more.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	2	If to others I am not an apostle, at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	20	To the Jews I became as a Jew, so that I might win Jews; to those who are under the Law, as under the Law though not being myself under the Law, so that I might win those who are under the Law;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	21	To those who are without law, as without law, though not being without the law of God but under the law of Christ, so that I might win those who are without law.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	22	To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak; I have become all things to all men, so that I may by all means save some.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	23	I do all things for the sake of the gospel, so that I may become a fellow partaker of it.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	24	Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	25	Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. They then do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	26	Therefore I run in such a way, as not without aim; I box in such a way, as not beating the air;	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	27	But I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified.	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	3	My defense to those who examine me is this:	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	4	Do we not have a right to eat and drink?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	5	Do we not have a right to take along a believing wife, even as the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	6	Or do only Barnabas and I not have a right to refrain from working?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	7	Who at any time serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat the fruit of it? Or who tends a flock and does not use the milk of the flock?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	8	I am not speaking these things according to human judgment, am I? Or does not the Law also say these things?	46
NASB	1 Corinthians	9	9	For it is written in the Law of Moses, &ldquo;YOU SHALL NOT MUZZLE THE OX WHILE HE IS THRESHING.&rdquo; God is not concerned about oxen, is He?	46
NASB	1 John	1	1	What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands, concerning the Word of Life&mdash;	62
NASB	1 John	1	10	If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in us.	62
NASB	1 John	1	2	And the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us&mdash;	62
NASB	1 John	1	3	What we have seen and heard we proclaim to you also, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.	62
NASB	1 John	1	4	These things we write, so that our joy may be made complete.	62
NASB	1 John	1	5	This is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all.	62
NASB	1 John	1	6	If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth;	62
NASB	1 John	1	7	But if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.	62
NASB	1 John	1	8	If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us.	62
NASB	1 John	1	9	If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.	62
NASB	1 John	2	1	My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous;	62
NASB	1 John	2	10	The one who loves his brother abides in the Light and there is no cause for stumbling in him.	62
NASB	1 John	2	11	But the one who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes.	62
NASB	1 John	2	12	I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you for His name&rsquo;s sake.	62
NASB	1 John	2	13	I am writing to you, fathers, because you know Him who has been from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I have written to you, children, because you know the Father.	62
NASB	1 John	2	14	I have written to you, fathers, because you know Him who has been from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.	62
NASB	1 John	2	15	Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.	62
NASB	1 John	2	16	For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world.	62
NASB	1 John	2	17	The world is passing away, and also its lusts; but the one who does the will of God lives forever.	62
NASB	1 John	2	18	Children, it is the last hour; and just as you heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have appeared; from this we know that it is the last hour.	62
NASB	1 John	2	19	They went out from us, but they were not really of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but they went out, so that it would be shown that they all are not of us.	62
NASB	1 John	2	2	And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.	62
NASB	1 John	2	20	But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.	62
NASB	1 John	2	21	I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie is of the truth.	62
NASB	1 John	2	22	Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son.	62
NASB	1 John	2	23	Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father; the one who confesses the Son has the Father also.	62
NASB	1 John	2	24	As for you, let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father.	62
NASB	1 John	2	25	This is the promise which He Himself made to us: eternal life.	62
NASB	1 John	2	26	These things I have written to you concerning those who are trying to deceive you.	62
NASB	1 John	2	27	As for you, the anointing which you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you; but as His anointing teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you abide in Him.	62
NASB	1 John	2	28	Now, little children, abide in Him, so that when He appears, we may have confidence and not shrink away from Him in shame at His coming.	62
NASB	1 John	2	29	If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone also who practices righteousness is born of Him.	62
NASB	1 John	2	3	By this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments.	62
NASB	1 John	2	4	The one who says, &ldquo;I have come to know Him,&rdquo; and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him;	62
NASB	1 John	2	5	But whoever keeps His word, in him the love of God has truly been perfected. By this we know that we are in Him:	62
NASB	1 John	2	6	The one who says he abides in Him ought himself to walk in the same manner as He walked.	62
NASB	1 John	2	7	Beloved, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word which you have heard.	62
NASB	1 John	2	8	On the other hand, I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true Light is already shining.	62
NASB	1 John	2	9	The one who says he is in the Light and yet hates his brother is in the darkness until now.	62
NASB	1 John	3	1	See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we would be called children of God; and such we are. For this reason the world does not know us, because it did not know Him.	62
NASB	1 John	3	10	By this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious: anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his brother.	62
NASB	1 John	3	11	For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another;	62
NASB	1 John	3	12	Not as Cain, who was of the evil one and slew his brother. And for what reason did he slay him? Because his deeds were evil, and his brother&rsquo;s were righteous.	62
NASB	1 John	3	13	Do not be surprised, brethren, if the world hates you.	62
NASB	1 John	3	14	We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death.	62
NASB	1 John	3	15	Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer; and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.	62
NASB	1 John	3	16	We know love by this, that He laid down His life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.	62
NASB	1 John	3	17	But whoever has the world&rsquo;s goods, and sees his brother in need and closes his heart against him, how does the love of God abide in him?	62
NASB	1 John	3	18	Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and truth.	62
NASB	1 John	3	19	We will know by this that we are of the truth, and will assure our heart before Him	62
NASB	1 John	3	2	Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is.	62
NASB	1 John	3	20	In whatever our heart condemns us; for God is greater than our heart and knows all things.	62
NASB	1 John	3	21	Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God;	62
NASB	1 John	3	22	And whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight.	62
NASB	1 John	3	23	This is His commandment, that we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as He commanded us.	62
NASB	1 John	3	24	The one who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. We know by this that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us.	62
NASB	1 John	3	3	And everyone who has this hope fixed on Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.	62
NASB	1 John	3	4	Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.	62
NASB	1 John	3	5	You know that He appeared in order to take away sins; and in Him there is no sin.	62
NASB	1 John	3	6	No one who abides in Him sins; no one who sins has seen Him or knows Him.	62
NASB	1 John	3	7	Little children, make sure no one deceives you; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous;	62
NASB	1 John	3	8	The one who practices sin is of the devil; for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil.	62
NASB	1 John	3	9	No one who is born of God practices sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.	62
NASB	1 John	4	1	Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.	62
NASB	1 John	4	10	In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.	62
NASB	1 John	4	11	Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.	62
NASB	1 John	4	12	No one has seen God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us.	62
NASB	1 John	4	13	By this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit.	62
NASB	1 John	4	14	We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.	62
NASB	1 John	4	15	Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.	62
NASB	1 John	4	16	We have come to know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.	62
NASB	1 John	4	17	By this, love is perfected with us, so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment; because as He is, so also are we in this world.	62
NASB	1 John	4	18	There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves punishment, and the one who fears is not perfected in love.	62
NASB	1 John	4	19	We love, because He first loved us.	62
NASB	1 John	4	2	By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God;	62
NASB	1 John	4	20	If someone says, &ldquo;I love God,&rdquo; and hates his brother, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen.	62
NASB	1 John	4	21	And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also.	62
NASB	1 John	4	3	And every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God; this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now it is already in the world.	62
NASB	1 John	4	4	You are from God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.	62
NASB	1 John	4	5	They are from the world; therefore they speak as from the world, and the world listens to them.	62
NASB	1 John	4	6	We are from God; he who knows God listens to us; he who is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.	62
NASB	1 John	4	7	Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God.	62
NASB	1 John	4	8	The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love.	62
NASB	1 John	4	9	By this the love of God was manifested in us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world so that we might live through Him.	62
NASB	1 John	5	1	Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and whoever loves the Father loves the child born of Him.	62
NASB	1 John	5	10	The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself; the one who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning His Son.	62
NASB	1 John	5	11	And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.	62
NASB	1 John	5	12	He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.	62
NASB	1 John	5	13	These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life.	62
NASB	1 John	5	14	This is the confidence which we have before Him, that, if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.	62
NASB	1 John	5	15	And if we know that He hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him.	62
NASB	1 John	5	16	If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask and God will for him give life to those who commit sin not leading to death. There is a sin leading to death; I do not say that he should make request for this.	62
NASB	1 John	5	17	All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not leading to death.	62
NASB	1 John	5	18	We know that no one who is born of God sins; but He who was born of God keeps him, and the evil one does not touch him.	62
NASB	1 John	5	19	We know that we are of God, and that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.	62
NASB	1 John	5	2	By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and observe His commandments.	62
NASB	1 John	5	20	And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.	62
NASB	1 John	5	21	Little children, guard yourselves from idols.	62
NASB	1 John	5	3	For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome.	62
NASB	1 John	5	4	For whatever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that has overcome the world&mdash;our faith.	62
NASB	1 John	5	5	Who is the one who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?	62
NASB	1 John	5	6	This is the One who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.	62
NASB	1 John	5	7	For there are three that testify:	62
NASB	1 John	5	8	The Spirit and the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement.	62
NASB	1 John	5	9	If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for the testimony of God is this, that He has testified concerning His Son.	62
NASB	1 Peter	1	1	Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who reside as aliens, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, who are chosen	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	10	As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would come to you made careful searches and inquiries,	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	11	Seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow.	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	12	It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven&mdash;things into which angels long to look.	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	13	Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep sober in spirit, fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	14	As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance,	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	15	But like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior;	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	16	Because it is written, &ldquo;YOU SHALL BE HOLY, FOR I AM HOLY.&rdquo;	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	17	If you address as Father the One who impartially judges according to each one&rsquo;s work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your stay on earth;	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	18	Knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers,	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	19	But with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ.	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	2	According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure.	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	20	For He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but has appeared in these last times for the sake of you	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	21	Who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	22	Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart,	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	23	For you have been born again not of seed which is perishable but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of God.	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	24	For, &ldquo;ALL FLESH IS LIKE GRASS, AND ALL ITS GLORY LIKE THE FLOWER OF GRASS. THE GRASS WITHERS, AND THE FLOWER FALLS OFF,	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	25	BUT THE WORD OF THE LORD ENDURES FOREVER.&rdquo; And this is the word which was preached to you.	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	4	To obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you,	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	5	Who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	6	In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials,	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	7	So that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ;	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	8	And though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory,	60
NASB	1 Peter	1	9	Obtaining as the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls.	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	1	Therefore, putting aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander,	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	10	For you once were NOT A PEOPLE, but now you are THE PEOPLE OF GOD; you had NOT RECEIVED MERCY, but now you have RECEIVED MERCY.	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	11	Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul.	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	12	Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers, they may because of your good deeds, as they observe them, glorify God in the day of visitation.	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	13	Submit yourselves for the Lord&rsquo;s sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority,	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	14	Or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right.	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	15	For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men.	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	16	Act as free men, and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but use it as bondslaves of God.	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	17	Honor all people, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king.	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	18	Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable.	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	19	For this finds favor, if for the sake of conscience toward God a person bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly.	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	2	Like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation,	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	20	For what credit is there if, when you sin and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience? But if when you do what is right and suffer for it you patiently endure it, this finds favor with God.	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	21	For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps,	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	22	WHO COMMITTED NO SIN, NOR WAS ANY DECEIT FOUND IN HIS MOUTH;	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	23	And while being reviled, He did not revile in return; while suffering, He uttered no threats, but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously;	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	24	And He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were healed.	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	25	For you were continually straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	3	If you have tasted the kindness of the Lord.	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	4	And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been rejected by men, but is choice and precious in the sight of God,	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	5	You also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	6	For this is contained in Scripture: &ldquo;BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A CHOICE STONE, A PRECIOUS CORNER stone, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.&rdquo;	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	7	This precious value, then, is for you who believe; but for those who disbelieve, &ldquo;THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE VERY CORNER stone,&rdquo;	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	8	And, &ldquo;A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE&rdquo;; for they stumble because they are disobedient to the word, and to this doom they were also appointed.	60
NASB	1 Peter	2	9	But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, A PEOPLE FOR God&rsquo;s OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;	60
NASB	1 Peter	3	1	In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be won without a word by the behavior of their wives,	60
NASB	1 Peter	3	10	For, &ldquo;THE ONE WHO DESIRES LIFE, TO LOVE AND SEE GOOD DAYS, MUST KEEP HIS TONGUE FROM EVIL AND HIS LIPS FROM SPEAKING DECEIT.	60
NASB	1 Peter	3	11	&ldquo;HE MUST TURN AWAY FROM EVIL AND DO GOOD; HE MUST SEEK PEACE AND PURSUE IT.	60
NASB	1 Peter	3	12	&ldquo;FOR THE EYES OF THE LORD ARE TOWARD THE RIGHTEOUS, AND HIS EARS ATTEND TO THEIR PRAYER, BUT THE FACE OF THE LORD IS AGAINST THOSE WHO DO EVIL.&rdquo;	60
NASB	1 Peter	3	13	Who is there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good?	60
NASB	1 Peter	3	14	But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed. AND DO NOT FEAR THEIR INTIMIDATION, AND DO NOT BE TROUBLED,	60
NASB	1 Peter	3	15	But sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence;	60
NASB	1 Peter	3	16	And keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame.	60
NASB	1 Peter	3	17	For it is better, if God should will it so, that you suffer for doing what is right rather than for doing what is wrong.	60
NASB	1 Peter	3	18	For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;	60
NASB	1 Peter	3	19	In which also He went and made proclamation to the spirits now in prison,	60
NASB	1 Peter	3	2	As they observe your chaste and respectful behavior.	60
NASB	1 Peter	3	20	Who once were disobedient, when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through the water.	60
NASB	1 Peter	3	21	Corresponding to that, baptism now saves you&mdash;not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience&mdash;through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,	60
NASB	1 Peter	3	22	Who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, after angels and authorities and powers had been subjected to Him.	60
NASB	1 Peter	3	3	Your adornment must not be merely external&mdash;braiding the hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on dresses;	60
NASB	1 Peter	3	4	But let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God.	60
NASB	1 Peter	3	5	For in this way in former times the holy women also, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, being submissive to their own husbands;	60
NASB	1 Peter	3	6	Just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, and you have become her children if you do what is right without being frightened by any fear.	60
NASB	1 Peter	3	7	You husbands in the same way, live with your wives in an understanding way, as with someone weaker, since she is a woman; and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered.	60
NASB	1 Peter	3	8	To sum up, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted, and humble in spirit;	60
NASB	1 Peter	3	9	Not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead; for you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing.	60
NASB	1 Peter	4	1	Therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same purpose, because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,	60
NASB	1 Peter	4	10	As each one has received a special gift, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.	60
NASB	1 Peter	4	11	Whoever speaks, is to do so as one who is speaking the utterances of God; whoever serves is to do so as one who is serving by the strength which God supplies; so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.	60
NASB	1 Peter	4	12	Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange thing were happening to you;	60
NASB	1 Peter	4	13	But to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing, so that also at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice with exultation.	60
NASB	1 Peter	4	14	If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.	60
NASB	1 Peter	4	15	Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or a troublesome meddler;	60
NASB	1 Peter	4	16	But if anyone suffers as a Christian, he is not to be ashamed, but is to glorify God in this name.	60
NASB	1 Peter	4	17	For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?	60
NASB	1 Peter	4	18	AND IF IT IS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT THE RIGHTEOUS IS SAVED, WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE GODLESS MAN AND THE SINNER?	60
NASB	1 Peter	4	19	Therefore, those also who suffer according to the will of God shall entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing what is right.	60
NASB	1 Peter	4	2	So as to live the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.	60
NASB	1 Peter	4	3	For the time already past is sufficient for you to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, having pursued a course of sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties and abominable idolatries.	60
NASB	1 Peter	4	4	In all this, they are surprised that you do not run with them into the same excesses of dissipation, and they malign you;	60
NASB	1 Peter	4	5	But they will give account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.	60
NASB	1 Peter	4	6	For the gospel has for this purpose been preached even to those who are dead, that though they are judged in the flesh as men, they may live in the spirit according to the will of God.	60
NASB	1 Peter	4	7	The end of all things is near; therefore, be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer.	60
NASB	1 Peter	4	8	Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.	60
NASB	1 Peter	4	9	Be hospitable to one another without complaint.	60
NASB	1 Peter	5	1	Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, as your fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed,	60
NASB	1 Peter	5	10	After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen and establish you.	60
NASB	1 Peter	5	11	To Him be dominion forever and ever. Amen.	60
NASB	1 Peter	5	12	Through Silvanus, our faithful brother (for so I regard him), I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it!	60
NASB	1 Peter	5	13	She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and so does my son, Mark.	60
NASB	1 Peter	5	14	Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all who are in Christ.	60
NASB	1 Peter	5	2	Shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not for sordid gain, but with eagerness;	60
NASB	1 Peter	5	3	Nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples to the flock.	60
NASB	1 Peter	5	4	And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.	60
NASB	1 Peter	5	5	You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; and all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, for GOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE.	60
NASB	1 Peter	5	6	Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time,	60
NASB	1 Peter	5	7	Casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you.	60
NASB	1 Peter	5	8	Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.	60
NASB	1 Peter	5	9	But resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world.	60
NASB	1 Thessalonians	1	1	Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	1	10	And to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, that is Jesus, who rescues us from the wrath to come.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	1	2	We give thanks to God always for all of you, making mention of you in our prayers;	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	1	3	Constantly bearing in mind your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father,	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	1	4	Knowing, brethren beloved by God, His choice of you;	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	1	5	For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction; just as you know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	1	6	You also became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much tribulation with the joy of the Holy Spirit,	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	1	7	So that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	1	8	For the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone forth, so that we have no need to say anything.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	1	9	For they themselves report about us what kind of a reception we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God,	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	2	1	For you yourselves know, brethren, that our coming to you was not in vain,	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	2	10	You are witnesses, and so is God, how devoutly and uprightly and blamelessly we behaved toward you believers;	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	2	11	Just as you know how we were exhorting and encouraging and imploring each one of you as a father would his own children,	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	2	12	So that you would walk in a manner worthy of the God who calls you into His own kingdom and glory.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	2	13	For this reason we also constantly thank God that when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but for what it really is, the word of God, which also performs its work in you who believe.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	2	14	For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, for you also endured the same sufferings at the hands of your own countrymen, even as they did from the Jews,	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	2	15	Who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out. They are not pleasing to God, but hostile to all men,	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	2	16	Hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved; with the result that they always fill up the measure of their sins. But wrath has come upon them to the utmost.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	2	17	But we, brethren, having been taken away from you for a short while&mdash;in person, not in spirit&mdash;were all the more eager with great desire to see your face.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	2	18	For we wanted to come to you&mdash;I, Paul, more than once&mdash;and yet Satan hindered us.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	2	19	For who is our hope or joy or crown of exultation? Is it not even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming?	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	2	2	But after we had already suffered and been mistreated in Philippi, as you know, we had the boldness in our God to speak to you the gospel of God amid much opposition.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	2	20	For you are our glory and joy.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	2	3	For our exhortation does not come from error or impurity or by way of deceit;	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	2	4	But just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who examines our hearts.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	2	5	For we never came with flattering speech, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed&mdash;God is witness&mdash;	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	2	6	Nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from others, even though as apostles of Christ we might have asserted our authority.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	2	7	But we proved to be gentle among you, as a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	2	8	Having so fond an affection for you, we were well-pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become very dear to us.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	2	9	For you recall, brethren, our labor and hardship, how working night and day so as not to be a burden to any of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	3	1	Therefore when we could endure it no longer, we thought it best to be left behind at Athens alone,	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	3	10	As we night and day keep praying most earnestly that we may see your face, and may complete what is lacking in your faith?	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	3	11	Now may our God and Father Himself and Jesus our Lord direct our way to you;	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	3	12	And may the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love for one another, and for all people, just as we also do for you;	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	3	13	So that He may establish your hearts without blame in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	3	2	And we sent Timothy, our brother and God&rsquo;s fellow worker in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you as to your faith,	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	3	3	So that no one would be disturbed by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we have been destined for this.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	3	4	For indeed when we were with you, we kept telling you in advance that we were going to suffer affliction; and so it came to pass, as you know.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	3	5	For this reason, when I could endure it no longer, I also sent to find out about your faith, for fear that the tempter might have tempted you, and our labor would be in vain.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	3	6	But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you always think kindly of us, longing to see us just as we also long to see you,	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	3	7	For this reason, brethren, in all our distress and affliction we were comforted about you through your faith;	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	3	8	For now we really live, if you stand firm in the Lord.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	3	9	For what thanks can we render to God for you in return for all the joy with which we rejoice before our God on your account,	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	4	1	Finally then, brethren, we request and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us instruction as to how you ought to walk and please God (just as you actually do walk), that you excel still more.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	4	10	For indeed you do practice it toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia. But we urge you, brethren, to excel still more,	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	4	11	And to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life and attend to your own business and work with your hands, just as we commanded you,	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	4	12	So that you will behave properly toward outsiders and not be in any need.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	4	13	But we do not want you to be uninformed, brethren, about those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve as do the rest who have no hope.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	4	14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	4	15	For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	4	16	For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	4	17	Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	4	18	Therefore comfort one another with these words.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	4	2	For you know what commandments we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	4	3	For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that is, that you abstain from sexual immorality;	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	4	4	That each of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor,	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	4	5	Not in lustful passion, like the Gentiles who do not know God;	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	4	6	And that no man transgress and defraud his brother in the matter because the Lord is the avenger in all these things, just as we also told you before and solemnly warned you.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	4	7	For God has not called us for the purpose of impurity, but in sanctification.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	4	8	So, he who rejects this is not rejecting man but the God who gives His Holy Spirit to you.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	4	9	Now as to the love of the brethren, you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another;	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	1	Now as to the times and the epochs, brethren, you have no need of anything to be written to you.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	10	Who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live together with Him.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	11	Therefore encourage one another and build up one another, just as you also are doing.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	12	But we request of you, brethren, that you appreciate those who diligently labor among you, and have charge over you in the Lord and give you instruction,	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	13	And that you esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Live in peace with one another.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	14	We urge you, brethren, admonish the unruly, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with everyone.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	15	See that no one repays another with evil for evil, but always seek after that which is good for one another and for all people.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	16	Rejoice always;	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	17	Pray without ceasing;	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	18	In everything give thanks; for this is God&rsquo;s will for you in Christ Jesus.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	19	Do not quench the Spirit;	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	2	For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord will come just like a thief in the night.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	20	Do not despise prophetic utterances.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	21	But examine everything carefully; hold fast to that which is good;	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	22	Abstain from every form of evil.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	23	Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	24	Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will bring it to pass.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	25	Brethren, pray for us.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	26	Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	27	I adjure you by the Lord to have this letter read to all the brethren.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	3	While they are saying, &ldquo;Peace and safety!&rdquo; then destruction will come upon them suddenly like labor pains upon a woman with child, and they will not escape.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	4	But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day would overtake you like a thief;	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	5	For you are all sons of light and sons of day. We are not of night nor of darkness;	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	6	So then let us not sleep as others do, but let us be alert and sober.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	7	For those who sleep do their sleeping at night, and those who get drunk get drunk at night.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	8	But since we are of the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope of salvation.	52
NASB	1 Thessalonians	5	9	For God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,	52
NASB	1 Timothy	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior, and of Christ Jesus, who is our hope,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	1	10	And immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	1	11	According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	1	12	I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because He considered me faithful, putting me into service,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	1	13	Even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor. Yet I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief;	54
NASB	1 Timothy	1	14	And the grace of our Lord was more than abundant, with the faith and love which are found in Christ Jesus.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	1	15	It is a trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, among whom I am foremost of all.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	1	16	Yet for this reason I found mercy, so that in me as the foremost, Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience as an example for those who would believe in Him for eternal life.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	1	17	Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	1	18	This command I entrust to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you fight the good fight,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	1	19	Keeping faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	1	2	To Timothy, my true child in the faith: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	1	20	Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, so that they will be taught not to blaspheme.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	1	3	As I urged you upon my departure for Macedonia, remain on at Ephesus so that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	1	4	Nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which give rise to mere speculation rather than furthering the administration of God which is by faith.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	1	5	But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	1	6	For some men, straying from these things, have turned aside to fruitless discussion,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	1	7	Wanting to be teachers of the Law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	1	8	But we know that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	1	9	Realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous person, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers	54
NASB	1 Timothy	2	1	First of all, then, I urge that entreaties and prayers, petitions and thanksgivings, be made on behalf of all men,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	2	10	But rather by means of good works, as is proper for women making a claim to godliness.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	2	11	A woman must quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	2	12	But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	2	13	For it was Adam who was first created, and then Eve.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	2	14	And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell into transgression.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	2	15	But women will be preserved through the bearing of children if they continue in faith and love and sanctity with self-restraint.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	2	2	For kings and all who are in authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	2	3	This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	2	4	Who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	2	5	For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	2	6	Who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony given at the proper time.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	2	7	For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying) as a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	2	8	Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and dissension.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	2	9	Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	3	1	It is a trustworthy statement: if any man aspires to the office of overseer, it is a fine work he desires to do.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	3	10	These men must also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons if they are beyond reproach.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	3	11	Women must likewise be dignified, not malicious gossips, but temperate, faithful in all things.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	3	12	Deacons must be husbands of only one wife, and good managers of their children and their own households.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	3	13	For those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a high standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	3	14	I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you before long;	54
NASB	1 Timothy	3	15	But in case I am delayed, I write so that you will know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	3	16	By common confession, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was revealed in the flesh, Was vindicated in the Spirit, Seen by angels, Proclaimed among the nations, Believed on in the world, Taken up in glory.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	3	2	An overseer, then, must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, prudent, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	3	3	Not addicted to wine or pugnacious, but gentle, peaceable, free from the love of money.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	3	4	He must be one who manages his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity	54
NASB	1 Timothy	3	5	(but if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?),	54
NASB	1 Timothy	3	6	And not a new convert, so that he will not become conceited and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	3	7	And he must have a good reputation with those outside the church, so that he will not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	3	8	Deacons likewise must be men of dignity, not double-tongued, or addicted to much wine or fond of sordid gain,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	3	9	But holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	4	1	But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	4	10	For it is for this we labor and strive, because we have fixed our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of believers.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	4	11	Prescribe and teach these things.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	4	12	Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but rather in speech, conduct, love, faith and purity, show yourself an example of those who believe.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	4	13	Until I come, give attention to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation and teaching.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	4	14	Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you, which was bestowed on you through prophetic utterance with the laying on of hands by the presbytery.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	4	15	Take pains with these things; be absorbed in them, so that your progress will be evident to all.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	4	16	Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching; persevere in these things, for as you do this you will ensure salvation both for yourself and for those who hear you.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	4	2	By means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	4	3	Men who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from foods which God has created to be gratefully shared in by those who believe and know the truth.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	4	4	For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with gratitude;	54
NASB	1 Timothy	4	5	For it is sanctified by means of the word of God and prayer.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	4	6	In pointing out these things to the brethren, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, constantly nourished on the words of the faith and of the sound doctrine which you have been following.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	4	7	But have nothing to do with worldly fables fit only for old women. On the other hand, discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness;	54
NASB	1 Timothy	4	8	For bodily discipline is only of little profit, but godliness is profitable for all things, since it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	4	9	It is a trustworthy statement deserving full acceptance.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	1	Do not sharply rebuke an older man, but rather appeal to him as a father, to the younger men as brothers,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	10	Having a reputation for good works; and if she has brought up children, if she has shown hospitality to strangers, if she has washed the saints&rsquo; feet, if she has assisted those in distress, and if she has devoted herself to every good work.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	11	But refuse to put younger widows on the list, for when they feel sensual desires in disregard of Christ, they want to get married,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	12	Thus incurring condemnation, because they have set aside their previous pledge.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	13	At the same time they also learn to be idle, as they go around from house to house; and not merely idle, but also gossips and busybodies, talking about things not proper to mention.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	14	Therefore, I want younger widows to get married, bear children, keep house, and give the enemy no occasion for reproach;	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	15	For some have already turned aside to follow Satan.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	16	If any woman who is a believer has dependent widows, she must assist them and the church must not be burdened, so that it may assist those who are widows indeed.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	17	The elders who rule well are to be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	18	For the Scripture says, &ldquo;YOU SHALL NOT MUZZLE THE OX WHILE HE IS THRESHING,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The laborer is worthy of his wages.&rdquo;	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	19	Do not receive an accusation against an elder except on the basis of two or three witnesses.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	2	The older women as mothers, and the younger women as sisters, in all purity.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	20	Those who continue in sin, rebuke in the presence of all, so that the rest also will be fearful of sinning.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	21	I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of His chosen angels, to maintain these principles without bias, doing nothing in a spirit of partiality.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	22	Do not lay hands upon anyone too hastily and thereby share responsibility for the sins of others; keep yourself free from sin.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	23	No longer drink water exclusively, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	24	The sins of some men are quite evident, going before them to judgment; for others, their sins follow after.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	25	Likewise also, deeds that are good are quite evident, and those which are otherwise cannot be concealed.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	3	Honor widows who are widows indeed;	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	4	But if any widow has children or grandchildren, they must first learn to practice piety in regard to their own family and to make some return to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	5	Now she who is a widow indeed and who has been left alone, has fixed her hope on God and continues in entreaties and prayers night and day.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	6	But she who gives herself to wanton pleasure is dead even while she lives.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	7	Prescribe these things as well, so that they may be above reproach.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	8	But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	5	9	A widow is to be put on the list only if she is not less than sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	6	1	All who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their own masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and our doctrine will not be spoken against.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	6	10	For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	6	11	But flee from these things, you man of God, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance and gentleness.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	6	12	Fight the good fight of faith; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	6	13	I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	6	14	That you keep the commandment without stain or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	6	15	Which He will bring about at the proper time&mdash;He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	6	16	Who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see. To Him be honor and eternal dominion! Amen.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	6	17	Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	6	18	Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	6	19	Storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is life indeed.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	6	2	Those who have believers as their masters must not be disrespectful to them because they are brethren, but must serve them all the more, because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved. Teach and preach these principles.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	6	20	O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, avoiding worldly and empty chatter and the opposing arguments of what is falsely called &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;&mdash;	54
NASB	1 Timothy	6	21	Which some have professed and thus gone astray from the faith. Grace be with you.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	6	3	If anyone advocates a different doctrine and does not agree with sound words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the doctrine conforming to godliness,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	6	4	He is conceited and understands nothing; but he has a morbid interest in controversial questions and disputes about words, out of which arise envy, strife, abusive language, evil suspicions,	54
NASB	1 Timothy	6	5	And constant friction between men of depraved mind and deprived of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	6	6	But godliness actually is a means of great gain when accompanied by contentment.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	6	7	For we have brought nothing into the world, so we cannot take anything out of it either.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	6	8	If we have food and covering, with these we shall be content.	54
NASB	1 Timothy	6	9	But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin and destruction.	54
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, To the church of God which is at Corinth with all the saints who are throughout Achaia:	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	10	Who delivered us from so great a peril of death, and will deliver us, He on whom we have set our hope. And He will yet deliver us,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	11	You also joining in helping us through your prayers, so that thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf for the favor bestowed on us through the prayers of many.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	12	For our proud confidence is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and godly sincerity, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	13	For we write nothing else to you than what you read and understand, and I hope you will understand until the end;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	14	Just as you also partially did understand us, that we are your reason to be proud as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	15	In this confidence I intended at first to come to you, so that you might twice receive a blessing;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	16	That is, to pass your way into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be helped on my journey to Judea.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	17	Therefore, I was not vacillating when I intended to do this, was I? Or what I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, so that with me there will be yes, yes and no, no at the same time?	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	18	But as God is faithful, our word to you is not yes and no.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	19	For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was preached among you by us&mdash;by me and Silvanus and Timothy&mdash;was not yes and no, but is yes in Him.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	20	For as many as are the promises of God, in Him they are yes; therefore also through Him is our Amen to the glory of God through us.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	21	Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and anointed us is God,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	22	Who also sealed us and gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	23	But I call God as witness to my soul, that to spare you I did not come again to Corinth.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	24	Not that we lord it over your faith, but are workers with you for your joy; for in your faith you are standing firm.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	4	Who comforts us in all our affliction so that we will be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	5	For just as the sufferings of Christ are ours in abundance, so also our comfort is abundant through Christ.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	6	But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; or if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which is effective in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	7	And our hope for you is firmly grounded, knowing that as you are sharers of our sufferings, so also you are sharers of our comfort.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	8	For we do not want you to be unaware, brethren, of our affliction which came to us in Asia, that we were burdened excessively, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	1	9	Indeed, we had the sentence of death within ourselves so that we would not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	10	1	Now I, Paul, myself urge you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ&mdash;I who am meek when face to face with you, but bold toward you when absent!	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	10	10	For they say, &ldquo;His letters are weighty and strong, but his personal presence is unimpressive and his speech contemptible.&rdquo;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	10	11	Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when absent, such persons we are also in deed when present.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	10	12	For we are not bold to class or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves; but when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are without understanding.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	10	13	But we will not boast beyond our measure, but within the measure of the sphere which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even as far as you.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	10	14	For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we did not reach to you, for we were the first to come even as far as you in the gospel of Christ;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	10	15	Not boasting beyond our measure, that is, in other men&rsquo;s labors, but with the hope that as your faith grows, we will be, within our sphere, enlarged even more by you,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	10	16	So as to preach the gospel even to the regions beyond you, and not to boast in what has been accomplished in the sphere of another.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	10	17	But HE WHO BOASTS IS TO BOAST IN THE LORD.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	10	18	For it is not he who commends himself that is approved, but he whom the Lord commends.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	10	2	I ask that when I am present I need not be bold with the confidence with which I propose to be courageous against some, who regard us as if we walked according to the flesh.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	10	3	For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	10	4	For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	10	5	We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	10	6	And we are ready to punish all disobedience, whenever your obedience is complete.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	10	7	You are looking at things as they are outwardly. If anyone is confident in himself that he is Christ&rsquo;s, let him consider this again within himself, that just as he is Christ&rsquo;s, so also are we.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	10	8	For even if I boast somewhat further about our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I will not be put to shame,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	10	9	For I do not wish to seem as if I would terrify you by my letters.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	1	I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness; but indeed you are bearing with me.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	10	As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be stopped in the regions of Achaia.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	11	Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	12	But what I am doing I will continue to do, so that I may cut off opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in the matter about which they are boasting.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	13	For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	14	No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	15	Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their deeds.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	16	Again I say, let no one think me foolish; but if you do, receive me even as foolish, so that I also may boast a little.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	17	What I am saying, I am not saying as the Lord would, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	18	Since many boast according to the flesh, I will boast also.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	19	For you, being so wise, tolerate the foolish gladly.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	2	For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy; for I betrothed you to one husband, so that to Christ I might present you as a pure virgin.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	20	For you tolerate it if anyone enslaves you, anyone devours you, anyone takes advantage of you, anyone exalts himself, anyone hits you in the face.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	21	To my shame I must say that we have been weak by comparison. But in whatever respect anyone else is bold&mdash;I speak in foolishness&mdash;I am just as bold myself.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	22	Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	23	Are they servants of Christ?&mdash;I speak as if insane&mdash;I more so; in far more labors, in far more imprisonments, beaten times without number, often in danger of death.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	24	Five times I received from the Jews thirty-nine lashes.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	25	Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, a night and a day I have spent in the deep.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	26	I have been on frequent journeys, in dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my countrymen, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the wilderness, dangers on the sea, dangers among false brethren;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	27	I have been in labor and hardship, through many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	28	Apart from such external things, there is the daily pressure on me of concern for all the churches.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	29	Who is weak without my being weak? Who is led into sin without my intense concern?	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	3	But I am afraid that, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your minds will be led astray from the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	30	If I have to boast, I will boast of what pertains to my weakness.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	31	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, He who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	32	In Damascus the ethnarch under Aretas the king was guarding the city of the Damascenes in order to seize me,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	33	And I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and so escaped his hands.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	4	For if one comes and preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you have not accepted, you bear this beautifully.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	5	For I consider myself not in the least inferior to the most eminent apostles.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	6	But even if I am unskilled in speech, yet I am not so in knowledge; in fact, in every way we have made this evident to you in all things.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	7	Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you without charge?	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	8	I robbed other churches by taking wages from them to serve you;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	11	9	And when I was present with you and was in need, I was not a burden to anyone; for when the brethren came from Macedonia they fully supplied my need, and in everything I kept myself from being a burden to you, and will continue to do so.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	12	1	Boasting is necessary, though it is not profitable; but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	12	10	Therefore I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ&rsquo;s sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	12	11	I have become foolish; you yourselves compelled me. Actually I should have been commended by you, for in no respect was I inferior to the most eminent apostles, even though I am a nobody.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	12	12	The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with all perseverance, by signs and wonders and miracles.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	12	13	For in what respect were you treated as inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not become a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	12	14	Here for this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I do not seek what is yours, but you; for children are not responsible to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	12	15	I will most gladly spend and be expended for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	12	16	But be that as it may, I did not burden you myself; nevertheless, crafty fellow that I am, I took you in by deceit.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	12	17	Certainly I have not taken advantage of you through any of those whom I have sent to you, have I?	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	12	18	I urged Titus to go, and I sent the brother with him. Titus did not take any advantage of you, did he? Did we not conduct ourselves in the same spirit and walk in the same steps?	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	12	19	All this time you have been thinking that we are defending ourselves to you. Actually, it is in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ; and all for your upbuilding, beloved.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	12	2	I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago&mdash;whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do not know, God knows&mdash;such a man was caught up to the third heaven.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	12	20	For I am afraid that perhaps when I come I may find you to be not what I wish and may be found by you to be not what you wish; that perhaps there will be strife, jealousy, angry tempers, disputes, slanders, gossip, arrogance, disturbances;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	12	21	I am afraid that when I come again my God may humiliate me before you, and I may mourn over many of those who have sinned in the past and not repented of the impurity, immorality and sensuality which they have practiced.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	12	3	And I know how such a man&mdash;whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, God knows&mdash;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	12	4	Was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which a man is not permitted to speak.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	12	5	On behalf of such a man I will boast; but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in regard to my weaknesses.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	12	6	For if I do wish to boast I will not be foolish, for I will be speaking the truth; but I refrain from this, so that no one will credit me with more than he sees in me or hears from me.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	12	7	Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, for this reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me&mdash;to keep me from exalting myself!	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	12	8	Concerning this I implored the Lord three times that it might leave me.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	12	9	And He has said to me, &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.&rdquo; Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	13	1	This is the third time I am coming to you. EVERY FACT IS TO BE CONFIRMED BY THE TESTIMONY OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	13	10	For this reason I am writing these things while absent, so that when present I need not use severity, in accordance with the authority which the Lord gave me for building up and not for tearing down.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	13	11	Finally, brethren, rejoice, be made complete, be comforted, be like-minded, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	13	12	Greet one another with a holy kiss.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	13	13	All the saints greet you.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	13	14	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	13	2	I have previously said when present the second time, and though now absent I say in advance to those who have sinned in the past and to all the rest as well, that if I come again I will not spare anyone,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	13	3	Since you are seeking for proof of the Christ who speaks in me, and who is not weak toward you, but mighty in you.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	13	4	For indeed He was crucified because of weakness, yet He lives because of the power of God. For we also are weak in Him, yet we will live with Him because of the power of God directed toward you.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	13	5	Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith; examine yourselves! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you&mdash;unless indeed you fail the test?	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	13	6	But I trust that you will realize that we ourselves do not fail the test.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	13	7	Now we pray to God that you do no wrong; not that we ourselves may appear approved, but that you may do what is right, even though we may appear unapproved.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	13	8	For we can do nothing against the truth, but only for the truth.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	13	9	For we rejoice when we ourselves are weak but you are strong; this we also pray for, that you be made complete.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	2	1	But I determined this for my own sake, that I would not come to you in sorrow again.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	2	10	But one whom you forgive anything, I forgive also; for indeed what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, I did it for your sakes in the presence of Christ,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	2	11	So that no advantage would be taken of us by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	2	12	Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ and when a door was opened for me in the Lord,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	2	13	I had no rest for my spirit, not finding Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I went on to Macedonia.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	2	14	But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and manifests through us the sweet aroma of the knowledge of Him in every place.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	2	15	For we are a fragrance of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	2	16	To the one an aroma from death to death, to the other an aroma from life to life. And who is adequate for these things?	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	2	17	For we are not like many, peddling the word of God, but as from sincerity, but as from God, we speak in Christ in the sight of God.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	2	2	For if I cause you sorrow, who then makes me glad but the one whom I made sorrowful?	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	2	3	This is the very thing I wrote you, so that when I came, I would not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice; having confidence in you all that my joy would be the joy of you all.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	2	4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not so that you would be made sorrowful, but that you might know the love which I have especially for you.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	2	5	But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow not to me, but in some degree&mdash;in order not to say too much&mdash;to all of you.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	2	6	Sufficient for such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the majority,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	2	7	So that on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort him, otherwise such a one might be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	2	8	Wherefore I urge you to reaffirm your love for him.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	2	9	For to this end also I wrote, so that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	3	1	Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some, letters of commendation to you or from you?	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	3	10	For indeed what had glory, in this case has no glory because of the glory that surpasses it.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	3	11	For if that which fades away was with glory, much more that which remains is in glory.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	3	12	Therefore having such a hope, we use great boldness in our speech,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	3	13	And are not like Moses, who used to put a veil over his face so that the sons of Israel would not look intently at the end of what was fading away.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	3	14	But their minds were hardened; for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains unlifted, because it is removed in Christ.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	3	15	But to this day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their heart;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	3	16	But whenever a person turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	3	17	Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	3	18	But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	3	2	You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	3	3	Being manifested that you are a letter of Christ, cared for by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	3	4	Such confidence we have through Christ toward God.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	3	5	Not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as coming from ourselves, but our adequacy is from God,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	3	6	Who also made us adequate as servants of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	3	7	But if the ministry of death, in letters engraved on stones, came with glory, so that the sons of Israel could not look intently at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, fading as it was,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	3	8	How will the ministry of the Spirit fail to be even more with glory?	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	3	9	For if the ministry of condemnation has glory, much more does the ministry of righteousness abound in glory.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	4	1	Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we received mercy, we do not lose heart,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	4	10	Always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	4	11	For we who live are constantly being delivered over to death for Jesus&rsquo; sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	4	12	So death works in us, but life in you.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	4	13	But having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, &ldquo;I BELIEVED, THEREFORE I SPOKE,&rdquo; we also believe, therefore we also speak,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	4	14	Knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and will present us with you.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	4	15	For all things are for your sakes, so that the grace which is spreading to more and more people may cause the giving of thanks to abound to the glory of God.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	4	16	Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	4	17	For momentary, light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	4	18	While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	4	2	But we have renounced the things hidden because of shame, not walking in craftiness or adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of truth commending ourselves to every man&rsquo;s conscience in the sight of God.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	4	3	And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	4	4	In whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	4	5	For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your bond-servants for Jesus&rsquo; sake.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	4	6	For God, who said, &ldquo;Light shall shine out of darkness,&rdquo; is the One who has shone in our hearts to give the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	4	7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, so that the surpassing greatness of the power will be of God and not from ourselves;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	4	8	We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not despairing;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	4	9	Persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	5	1	For we know that if the earthly tent which is our house is torn down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	5	10	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	5	11	Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest to God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	5	12	We are not again commending ourselves to you but are giving you an occasion to be proud of us, so that you will have an answer for those who take pride in appearance and not in heart.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	5	13	For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are of sound mind, it is for you.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	5	14	For the love of Christ controls us, having concluded this, that one died for all, therefore all died;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	5	15	And He died for all, so that they who live might no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died and rose again on their behalf.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	5	16	Therefore from now on we recognize no one according to the flesh; even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him in this way no longer.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	5	17	Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	5	18	Now all these things are from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	5	19	Namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed to us the word of reconciliation.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	5	2	For indeed in this house we groan, longing to be clothed with our dwelling from heaven,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	5	20	Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	5	21	He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	5	3	Inasmuch as we, having put it on, will not be found naked.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	5	4	For indeed while we are in this tent, we groan, being burdened, because we do not want to be unclothed but to be clothed, so that what is mortal will be swallowed up by life.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	5	5	Now He who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave to us the Spirit as a pledge.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	5	6	Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord&mdash;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	5	7	For we walk by faith, not by sight&mdash;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	5	8	We are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	5	9	Therefore we also have as our ambition, whether at home or absent, to be pleasing to Him.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	6	1	And working together with Him, we also urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain&mdash;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	6	10	As sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich, as having nothing yet possessing all things.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	6	11	Our mouth has spoken freely to you, O Corinthians, our heart is opened wide.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	6	12	You are not restrained by us, but you are restrained in your own affections.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	6	13	Now in a like exchange&mdash;I speak as to children&mdash;open wide to us also.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	6	14	Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness?	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	6	15	Or what harmony has Christ with Belial, or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever?	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	6	16	Or what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; just as God said, &ldquo;I WILL DWELL IN THEM AND WALK AMONG THEM; AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	6	17	&ldquo;Therefore, COME OUT FROM THEIR MIDST AND BE SEPARATE,&rdquo; says the Lord. &ldquo;AND DO NOT TOUCH WHAT IS UNCLEAN; And I will welcome you.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	6	18	&ldquo;And I will be a father to you, And you shall be sons and daughters to Me,&rdquo; Says the Lord Almighty.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	6	2	For He says, &ldquo;AT THE ACCEPTABLE TIME I LISTENED TO YOU, AND ON THE DAY OF SALVATION I HELPED YOU.&rdquo; Behold, now is &ldquo;THE ACCEPTABLE TIME,&rdquo; behold, now is &ldquo;THE DAY OF SALVATION&rdquo;&mdash;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	6	3	Giving no cause for offense in anything, so that the ministry will not be discredited,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	6	4	But in everything commending ourselves as servants of God, in much endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	6	5	In beatings, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in hunger,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	6	6	In purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in genuine love,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	6	7	In the word of truth, in the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and the left,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	6	8	By glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; regarded as deceivers and yet true;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	6	9	As unknown yet well-known, as dying yet behold, we live; as punished yet not put to death,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	7	1	Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	7	10	For the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a repentance without regret, leading to salvation, but the sorrow of the world produces death.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	7	11	For behold what earnestness this very thing, this godly sorrow, has produced in you: what vindication of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what avenging of wrong! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in the matter.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	7	12	So although I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of the offender nor for the sake of the one offended, but that your earnestness on our behalf might be made known to you in the sight of God.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	7	13	For this reason we have been comforted. And besides our comfort, we rejoiced even much more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	7	14	For if in anything I have boasted to him about you, I was not put to shame; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, so also our boasting before Titus proved to be the truth.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	7	15	His affection abounds all the more toward you, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	7	16	I rejoice that in everything I have confidence in you.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	7	2	Make room for us in your hearts; we wronged no one, we corrupted no one, we took advantage of no one.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	7	3	I do not speak to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	7	4	Great is my confidence in you; great is my boasting on your behalf. I am filled with comfort; I am overflowing with joy in all our affliction.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	7	5	For even when we came into Macedonia our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted on every side: conflicts without, fears within.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	7	6	But God, who comforts the depressed, comforted us by the coming of Titus;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	7	7	And not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, as he reported to us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced even more.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	7	8	For though I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it; though I did regret it&mdash;for I see that that letter caused you sorrow, though only for a while&mdash;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	7	9	I now rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to the point of repentance; for you were made sorrowful according to the will of God, so that you might not suffer loss in anything through us.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	1	Now, brethren, we wish to make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	10	I give my opinion in this matter, for this is to your advantage, who were the first to begin a year ago not only to do this, but also to desire to do it.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	11	But now finish doing it also, so that just as there was the readiness to desire it, so there may be also the completion of it by your ability.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	12	For if the readiness is present, it is acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	13	For this is not for the ease of others and for your affliction, but by way of equality&mdash;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	14	At this present time your abundance being a supply for their need, so that their abundance also may become a supply for your need, that there may be equality;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	15	As it is written, &ldquo;HE WHO gathered MUCH DID NOT HAVE TOO MUCH, AND HE WHO gathered LITTLE HAD NO LACK.&rdquo;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	16	But thanks be to God who puts the same earnestness on your behalf in the heart of Titus.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	17	For he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest, he has gone to you of his own accord.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	18	We have sent along with him the brother whose fame in the things of the gospel has spread through all the churches;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	19	And not only this, but he has also been appointed by the churches to travel with us in this gracious work, which is being administered by us for the glory of the Lord Himself, and to show our readiness,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	2	That in a great ordeal of affliction their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	20	Taking precaution so that no one will discredit us in our administration of this generous gift;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	21	For we have regard for what is honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	22	We have sent with them our brother, whom we have often tested and found diligent in many things, but now even more diligent because of his great confidence in you.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	23	As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among you; as for our brethren, they are messengers of the churches, a glory to Christ.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	24	Therefore openly before the churches, show them the proof of your love and of our reason for boasting about you.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	3	For I testify that according to their ability, and beyond their ability, they gave of their own accord,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	4	Begging us with much urging for the favor of participation in the support of the saints,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	5	And this, not as we had expected, but they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us by the will of God.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	6	So we urged Titus that as he had previously made a beginning, so he would also complete in you this gracious work as well.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	7	But just as you abound in everything, in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all earnestness and in the love we inspired in you, see that you abound in this gracious work also.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	8	I am not speaking this as a command, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity of your love also.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	8	9	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	9	1	For it is superfluous for me to write to you about this ministry to the saints;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	9	10	Now He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	9	11	You will be enriched in everything for all liberality, which through us is producing thanksgiving to God.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	9	12	For the ministry of this service is not only fully supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing through many thanksgivings to God.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	9	13	Because of the proof given by this ministry, they will glorify God for your obedience to your confession of the gospel of Christ and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all,	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	9	14	While they also, by prayer on your behalf, yearn for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	9	15	Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	9	2	For I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to the Macedonians, namely, that Achaia has been prepared since last year, and your zeal has stirred up most of them.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	9	3	But I have sent the brethren, in order that our boasting about you may not be made empty in this case, so that, as I was saying, you may be prepared;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	9	4	Otherwise if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we&mdash;not to speak of you&mdash;will be put to shame by this confidence.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	9	5	So I thought it necessary to urge the brethren that they would go on ahead to you and arrange beforehand your previously promised bountiful gift, so that the same would be ready as a bountiful gift and not affected by covetousness.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	9	6	Now this I say, he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	9	7	Each one must do just as he has purposed in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	9	8	And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that always having all sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for every good deed;	47
NASB	2 Corinthians	9	9	As it is written, &ldquo;HE SCATTERED ABROAD, HE GAVE TO THE POOR, HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS ENDURES FOREVER.&rdquo;	47
NASB	2 John	1	1	The elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not only I, but also all who know the truth,	63
NASB	2 John	1	10	If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not give him a greeting;	63
NASB	2 John	1	11	For the one who gives him a greeting participates in his evil deeds.	63
NASB	2 John	1	12	Though I have many things to write to you, I do not want to do so with paper and ink; but I hope to come to you and speak face to face, so that your joy may be made full.	63
NASB	2 John	1	13	The children of your chosen sister greet you.	63
NASB	2 John	1	2	For the sake of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever:	63
NASB	2 John	1	3	Grace, mercy and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.	63
NASB	2 John	1	4	I was very glad to find some of your children walking in truth, just as we have received commandment to do from the Father.	63
NASB	2 John	1	5	Now I ask you, lady, not as though I were writing to you a new commandment, but the one which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another.	63
NASB	2 John	1	6	And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.	63
NASB	2 John	1	7	For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.	63
NASB	2 John	1	8	Watch yourselves, that you do not lose what we have accomplished, but that you may receive a full reward.	63
NASB	2 John	1	9	Anyone who goes too far and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God; the one who abides in the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son.	63
NASB	2 Peter	1	1	Simon Peter, a bond-servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who have received a faith of the same kind as ours, by the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ:	61
NASB	2 Peter	1	10	Therefore, brethren, be all the more diligent to make certain about His calling and choosing you; for as long as you practice these things, you will never stumble;	61
NASB	2 Peter	1	11	For in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be abundantly supplied to you.	61
NASB	2 Peter	1	12	Therefore, I will always be ready to remind you of these things, even though you already know them, and have been established in the truth which is present with you.	61
NASB	2 Peter	1	13	I consider it right, as long as I am in this earthly dwelling, to stir you up by way of reminder,	61
NASB	2 Peter	1	14	Knowing that the laying aside of my earthly dwelling is imminent, as also our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.	61
NASB	2 Peter	1	15	And I will also be diligent that at any time after my departure you will be able to call these things to mind.	61
NASB	2 Peter	1	16	For we did not follow cleverly devised tales when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty.	61
NASB	2 Peter	1	17	For when He received honor and glory from God the Father, such an utterance as this was made to Him by the Majestic Glory, &ldquo;This is My beloved Son with whom I am well-pleased&rdquo;&mdash;	61
NASB	2 Peter	1	18	And we ourselves heard this utterance made from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain.	61
NASB	2 Peter	1	19	So we have the prophetic word made more sure, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts.	61
NASB	2 Peter	1	2	Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord;	61
NASB	2 Peter	1	20	But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one&rsquo;s own interpretation,	61
NASB	2 Peter	1	21	For no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.	61
NASB	2 Peter	1	3	Seeing that His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence.	61
NASB	2 Peter	1	4	For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust.	61
NASB	2 Peter	1	5	Now for this very reason also, applying all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence, and in your moral excellence, knowledge,	61
NASB	2 Peter	1	6	And in your knowledge, self-control, and in your self-control, perseverance, and in your perseverance, godliness,	61
NASB	2 Peter	1	7	And in your godliness, brotherly kindness, and in your brotherly kindness, love.	61
NASB	2 Peter	1	8	For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they render you neither useless nor unfruitful in the true knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.	61
NASB	2 Peter	1	9	For he who lacks these qualities is blind or short-sighted, having forgotten his purification from his former sins.	61
NASB	2 Peter	2	1	But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will also be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves.	61
NASB	2 Peter	2	10	And especially those who indulge the flesh in its corrupt desires and despise authority. Daring, self-willed, they do not tremble when they revile angelic majesties,	61
NASB	2 Peter	2	11	Whereas angels who are greater in might and power do not bring a reviling judgment against them before the Lord.	61
NASB	2 Peter	2	12	But these, like unreasoning animals, born as creatures of instinct to be captured and killed, reviling where they have no knowledge, will in the destruction of those creatures also be destroyed,	61
NASB	2 Peter	2	13	Suffering wrong as the wages of doing wrong. They count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are stains and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions, as they carouse with you,	61
NASB	2 Peter	2	14	Having eyes full of adultery that never cease from sin, enticing unstable souls, having a heart trained in greed, accursed children;	61
NASB	2 Peter	2	15	Forsaking the right way, they have gone astray, having followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;	61
NASB	2 Peter	2	16	But he received a rebuke for his own transgression, for a mute donkey, speaking with a voice of a man, restrained the madness of the prophet.	61
NASB	2 Peter	2	17	These are springs without water and mists driven by a storm, for whom the black darkness has been reserved.	61
NASB	2 Peter	2	18	For speaking out arrogant words of vanity they entice by fleshly desires, by sensuality, those who barely escape from the ones who live in error,	61
NASB	2 Peter	2	19	Promising them freedom while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by what a man is overcome, by this he is enslaved.	61
NASB	2 Peter	2	2	Many will follow their sensuality, and because of them the way of the truth will be maligned;	61
NASB	2 Peter	2	20	For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and are overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.	61
NASB	2 Peter	2	21	For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn away from the holy commandment handed on to them.	61
NASB	2 Peter	2	22	It has happened to them according to the true proverb, &ldquo;A DOG RETURNS TO ITS OWN VOMIT,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;A sow, after washing, returns to wallowing in the mire.&rdquo;	61
NASB	2 Peter	2	3	And in their greed they will exploit you with false words; their judgment from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep.	61
NASB	2 Peter	2	4	For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to pits of darkness, reserved for judgment;	61
NASB	2 Peter	2	5	And did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, with seven others, when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;	61
NASB	2 Peter	2	6	And if He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by reducing them to ashes, having made them an example to those who would live ungodly lives thereafter;	61
NASB	2 Peter	2	7	And if He rescued righteous Lot, oppressed by the sensual conduct of unprincipled men	61
NASB	2 Peter	2	8	(for by what he saw and heard that righteous man, while living among them, felt his righteous soul tormented day after day by their lawless deeds),	61
NASB	2 Peter	2	9	Then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment,	61
NASB	2 Peter	3	1	This is now, beloved, the second letter I am writing to you in which I am stirring up your sincere mind by way of reminder,	61
NASB	2 Peter	3	10	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat, and the earth and its works will be burned up.	61
NASB	2 Peter	3	11	Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness,	61
NASB	2 Peter	3	12	Looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be destroyed by burning, and the elements will melt with intense heat!	61
NASB	2 Peter	3	13	But according to His promise we are looking for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.	61
NASB	2 Peter	3	14	Therefore, beloved, since you look for these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, spotless and blameless,	61
NASB	2 Peter	3	15	And regard the patience of our Lord as salvation; just as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, wrote to you,	61
NASB	2 Peter	3	16	As also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which the untaught and unstable distort, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.	61
NASB	2 Peter	3	17	You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, be on your guard so that you are not carried away by the error of unprincipled men and fall from your own steadfastness,	61
NASB	2 Peter	3	18	But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.	61
NASB	2 Peter	3	2	That you should remember the words spoken beforehand by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior spoken by your apostles.	61
NASB	2 Peter	3	3	Know this first of all, that in the last days mockers will come with their mocking, following after their own lusts,	61
NASB	2 Peter	3	4	And saying, &ldquo;Where is the promise of His coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all continues just as it was from the beginning of creation.&rdquo;	61
NASB	2 Peter	3	5	For when they maintain this, it escapes their notice that by the word of God the heavens existed long ago and the earth was formed out of water and by water,	61
NASB	2 Peter	3	6	Through which the world at that time was destroyed, being flooded with water.	61
NASB	2 Peter	3	7	But by His word the present heavens and earth are being reserved for fire, kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.	61
NASB	2 Peter	3	8	But do not let this one fact escape your notice, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day.	61
NASB	2 Peter	3	9	The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance.	61
NASB	2 Thessalonians	1	1	Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	1	10	When He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day, and to be marveled at among all who have believed&mdash;for our testimony to you was believed.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	1	11	To this end also we pray for you always, that our God will count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire for goodness and the work of faith with power,	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	1	12	So that the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	1	2	Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	1	3	We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brethren, as is only fitting, because your faith is greatly enlarged, and the love of each one of you toward one another grows ever greater;	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	1	4	Therefore, we ourselves speak proudly of you among the churches of God for your perseverance and faith in the midst of all your persecutions and afflictions which you endure.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	1	5	This is a plain indication of God&rsquo;s righteous judgment so that you will be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which indeed you are suffering.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	1	6	For after all it is only just for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you,	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	1	7	And to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when the Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire,	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	1	8	Dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	1	9	These will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power,	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	2	1	Now we request you, brethren, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him,	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	2	10	And with all the deception of wickedness for those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	2	11	For this reason God will send upon them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false,	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	2	12	In order that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in wickedness.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	2	13	But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	2	14	It was for this He called you through our gospel, that you may gain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	2	15	So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught, whether by word of mouth or by letter from us.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	2	16	Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given us eternal comfort and good hope by grace,	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	2	17	Comfort and strengthen your hearts in every good work and word.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	2	2	That you not be quickly shaken from your composure or be disturbed either by a spirit or a message or a letter as if from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	2	3	Let no one in any way deceive you, for it will not come unless the apostasy comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction,	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	2	4	Who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, displaying himself as being God.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	2	5	Do you not remember that while I was still with you, I was telling you these things?	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	2	6	And you know what restrains him now, so that in his time he will be revealed.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	2	7	For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	2	8	Then that lawless one will be revealed whom the Lord will slay with the breath of His mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming;	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	2	9	That is, the one whose coming is in accord with the activity of Satan, with all power and signs and false wonders,	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	3	1	Finally, brethren, pray for us that the word of the Lord will spread rapidly and be glorified, just as it did also with you;	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	3	10	For even when we were with you, we used to give you this order: if anyone is not willing to work, then he is not to eat, either.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	3	11	For we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined life, doing no work at all, but acting like busybodies.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	3	12	Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to work in quiet fashion and eat their own bread.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	3	13	But as for you, brethren, do not grow weary of doing good.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	3	14	If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take special note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he will be put to shame.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	3	15	Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	3	16	Now may the Lord of peace Himself continually grant you peace in every circumstance. The Lord be with you all!	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	3	17	I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, and this is a distinguishing mark in every letter; this is the way I write.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	3	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	3	2	And that we will be rescued from perverse and evil men; for not all have faith.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	3	3	But the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen and protect you from the evil one.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	3	4	We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing and will continue to do what we command.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	3	5	May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the steadfastness of Christ.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	3	6	Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from every brother who leads an unruly life and not according to the tradition which you received from us.	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	3	7	For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example, because we did not act in an undisciplined manner among you,	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	3	8	Nor did we eat anyone&rsquo;s bread without paying for it, but with labor and hardship we kept working night and day so that we would not be a burden to any of you;	53
NASB	2 Thessalonians	3	9	Not because we do not have the right to this, but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you, so that you would follow our example.	53
NASB	2 Timothy	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus,	55
NASB	2 Timothy	1	10	But now has been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,	55
NASB	2 Timothy	1	11	For which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	1	12	For this reason I also suffer these things, but I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	1	13	Retain the standard of sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	1	14	Guard, through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure which has been entrusted to you.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	1	15	You are aware of the fact that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	1	16	The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains;	55
NASB	2 Timothy	1	17	But when he was in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me&mdash;	55
NASB	2 Timothy	1	18	The Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord on that day&mdash;and you know very well what services he rendered at Ephesus.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	1	2	To Timothy, my beloved son: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	1	3	I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience the way my forefathers did, as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day,	55
NASB	2 Timothy	1	4	Longing to see you, even as I recall your tears, so that I may be filled with joy.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	1	5	For I am mindful of the sincere faith within you, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that it is in you as well.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	1	6	For this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	1	7	For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	1	8	Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me His prisoner, but join with me in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God,	55
NASB	2 Timothy	1	9	Who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was granted us in Christ Jesus from all eternity,	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	1	You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	10	For this reason I endure all things for the sake of those who are chosen, so that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus and with it eternal glory.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	11	It is a trustworthy statement: For if we died with Him, we will also live with Him;	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	12	If we endure, we will also reign with Him; If we deny Him, He also will deny us;	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	13	If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	14	Remind them of these things, and solemnly charge them in the presence of God not to wrangle about words, which is useless and leads to the ruin of the hearers.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	15	Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	16	But avoid worldly and empty chatter, for it will lead to further ungodliness,	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	17	And their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	18	Men who have gone astray from the truth saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and they upset the faith of some.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	19	Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, &ldquo;The Lord knows those who are His,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Everyone who names the name of the Lord is to abstain from wickedness.&rdquo;	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	2	The things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	20	Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also vessels of wood and of earthenware, and some to honor and some to dishonor.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	21	Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	22	Now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	23	But refuse foolish and ignorant speculations, knowing that they produce quarrels.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	24	The Lord&rsquo;s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged,	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	25	With gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth,	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	26	And they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	3	Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	4	No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	5	Also if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	6	The hard-working farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	7	Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	8	Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descendant of David, according to my gospel,	55
NASB	2 Timothy	2	9	For which I suffer hardship even to imprisonment as a criminal; but the word of God is not imprisoned.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	3	1	But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will come.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	3	10	Now you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, perseverance,	55
NASB	2 Timothy	3	11	Persecutions, and sufferings, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium and at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord rescued me!	55
NASB	2 Timothy	3	12	Indeed, all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	3	13	But evil men and impostors will proceed from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	3	14	You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them,	55
NASB	2 Timothy	3	15	And that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	3	16	All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;	55
NASB	2 Timothy	3	17	So that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	3	2	For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,	55
NASB	2 Timothy	3	3	Unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without self-control, brutal, haters of good,	55
NASB	2 Timothy	3	4	Treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,	55
NASB	2 Timothy	3	5	Holding to a form of godliness, although they have denied its power; Avoid such men as these.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	3	6	For among them are those who enter into households and captivate weak women weighed down with sins, led on by various impulses,	55
NASB	2 Timothy	3	7	Always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	3	8	Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men of depraved mind, rejected in regard to the faith.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	3	9	But they will not make further progress; for their folly will be obvious to all, just as Jannes&rsquo;s and Jambres&rsquo;s folly was also.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	4	1	I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom:	55
NASB	2 Timothy	4	10	For Demas, having loved this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	4	11	Only Luke is with me. Pick up Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	4	12	But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	4	13	When you come bring the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	4	14	Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	4	15	Be on guard against him yourself, for he vigorously opposed our teaching.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	4	16	At my first defense no one supported me, but all deserted me; may it not be counted against them.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	4	17	But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that through me the proclamation might be fully accomplished, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was rescued out of the lion&rsquo;s mouth.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	4	18	The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed, and will bring me safely to His heavenly kingdom; to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	4	19	Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	4	2	Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	4	20	Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I left sick at Miletus.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	4	21	Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, also Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	4	22	The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	4	3	For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires,	55
NASB	2 Timothy	4	4	And will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	4	5	But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	4	6	For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	4	7	I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith;	55
NASB	2 Timothy	4	8	In the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing.	55
NASB	2 Timothy	4	9	Make every effort to come to me soon;	55
NASB	3 John	1	1	The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.	64
NASB	3 John	1	10	For this reason, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with wicked words; and not satisfied with this, he himself does not receive the brethren, either, and he forbids those who desire to do so and puts them out of the church.	64
NASB	3 John	1	11	Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God.	64
NASB	3 John	1	12	Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself; and we add our testimony, and you know that our testimony is true.	64
NASB	3 John	1	13	I had many things to write to you, but I am not willing to write them to you with pen and ink;	64
NASB	3 John	1	14	But I hope to see you shortly, and we will speak face to face.	64
NASB	3 John	1	15	Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.	64
NASB	3 John	1	2	Beloved, I pray that in all respects you may prosper and be in good health, just as your soul prospers.	64
NASB	3 John	1	3	For I was very glad when brethren came and testified to your truth, that is, how you are walking in truth.	64
NASB	3 John	1	4	I have no greater joy than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.	64
NASB	3 John	1	5	Beloved, you are acting faithfully in whatever you accomplish for the brethren, and especially when they are strangers;	64
NASB	3 John	1	6	And they have testified to your love before the church. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.	64
NASB	3 John	1	7	For they went out for the sake of the Name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles.	64
NASB	3 John	1	8	Therefore we ought to support such men, so that we may be fellow workers with the truth.	64
NASB	3 John	1	9	I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not accept what we say.	64
NASB	Acts	1	1	The first account I composed, Theophilus, about all that Jesus began to do and teach,	44
NASB	Acts	1	10	And as they were gazing intently into the sky while He was going, behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them.	44
NASB	Acts	1	11	They also said, &ldquo;Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in just the same way as you have watched Him go into heaven.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	1	12	Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day&rsquo;s journey away.	44
NASB	Acts	1	13	When they had entered the city, they went up to the upper room where they were staying; that is, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.	44
NASB	Acts	1	14	These all with one mind were continually devoting themselves to prayer, along with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.	44
NASB	Acts	1	15	At this time Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren (a gathering of about one hundred and twenty persons was there together), and said,	44
NASB	Acts	1	16	&ldquo;Brethren, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit foretold by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus.	44
NASB	Acts	1	17	&ldquo;For he was counted among us and received his share in this ministry.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	1	18	(Now this man acquired a field with the price of his wickedness, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out.	44
NASB	Acts	1	19	And it became known to all who were living in Jerusalem; so that in their own language that field was called Hakeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)	44
NASB	Acts	1	2	Until the day when He was taken up to heaven, after He had by the Holy Spirit given orders to the apostles whom He had chosen.	44
NASB	Acts	1	20	&ldquo;For it is written in the book of Psalms, &lsquo;LET HIS HOMESTEAD BE MADE DESOLATE, AND LET NO ONE DWELL IN IT&rsquo;; and, &lsquo;LET ANOTHER MAN TAKE HIS OFFICE.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	1	21	&ldquo;Therefore it is necessary that of the men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us&mdash;	44
NASB	Acts	1	22	Beginning with the baptism of John until the day that He was taken up from us&mdash;one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	1	23	So they put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabbas (who was also called Justus), and Matthias.	44
NASB	Acts	1	24	And they prayed and said, &ldquo;You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two You have chosen	44
NASB	Acts	1	25	To occupy this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	1	26	And they drew lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias; and he was added to the eleven apostles.	44
NASB	Acts	1	3	To these He also presented Himself alive after His suffering, by many convincing proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God.	44
NASB	Acts	1	4	Gathering them together, He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, &ldquo;Which,&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;you heard of from Me;	44
NASB	Acts	1	5	For John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	1	6	So when they had come together, they were asking Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, is it at this time You are restoring the kingdom to Israel?&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	1	7	He said to them, &ldquo;It is not for you to know times or epochs which the Father has fixed by His own authority;	44
NASB	Acts	1	8	But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	1	9	And after He had said these things, He was lifted up while they were looking on, and a cloud received Him out of their sight.	44
NASB	Acts	10	1	Now there was a man at Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian cohort,	44
NASB	Acts	10	10	But he became hungry and was desiring to eat; but while they were making preparations, he fell into a trance;	44
NASB	Acts	10	11	And he saw the sky opened up, and an object like a great sheet coming down, lowered by four corners to the ground,	44
NASB	Acts	10	12	And there were in it all kinds of four-footed animals and crawling creatures of the earth and birds of the air.	44
NASB	Acts	10	13	A voice came to him, &ldquo;Get up, Peter, kill and eat!&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	10	14	But Peter said, &ldquo;By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything unholy and unclean.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	10	15	Again a voice came to him a second time, &ldquo;What God has cleansed, no longer consider unholy.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	10	16	This happened three times, and immediately the object was taken up into the sky.	44
NASB	Acts	10	17	Now while Peter was greatly perplexed in mind as to what the vision which he had seen might be, behold, the men who had been sent by Cornelius, having asked directions for Simon&rsquo;s house, appeared at the gate;	44
NASB	Acts	10	18	And calling out, they were asking whether Simon, who was also called Peter, was staying there.	44
NASB	Acts	10	19	While Peter was reflecting on the vision, the Spirit said to him, &ldquo;Behold, three men are looking for you.	44
NASB	Acts	10	2	A devout man and one who feared God with all his household, and gave many alms to the Jewish people and prayed to God continually.	44
NASB	Acts	10	20	&ldquo;But get up, go downstairs and accompany them without misgivings, for I have sent them Myself.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	10	21	Peter went down to the men and said, &ldquo;Behold, I am the one you are looking for; what is the reason for which you have come?&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	10	22	They said, &ldquo;Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man well spoken of by the entire nation of the Jews, was divinely directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and hear a message from you.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	10	23	So he invited them in and gave them lodging. And on the next day he got up and went away with them, and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.	44
NASB	Acts	10	24	On the following day he entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting for them and had called together his relatives and close friends.	44
NASB	Acts	10	25	When Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and fell at his feet and worshiped him.	44
NASB	Acts	10	26	But Peter raised him up, saying, &ldquo;Stand up; I too am just a man.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	10	27	As he talked with him, he entered and found many people assembled.	44
NASB	Acts	10	28	And he said to them, &ldquo;You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a man who is a Jew to associate with a foreigner or to visit him; and yet God has shown me that I should not call any man unholy or unclean.	44
NASB	Acts	10	29	&ldquo;That is why I came without even raising any objection when I was sent for. So I ask for what reason you have sent for me.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	10	3	About the ninth hour of the day he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God who had just come in and said to him, &ldquo;Cornelius!&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	10	30	Cornelius said, &ldquo;Four days ago to this hour, I was praying in my house during the ninth hour; and behold, a man stood before me in shining garments,	44
NASB	Acts	10	31	And he said, &lsquo;Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God.	44
NASB	Acts	10	32	&lsquo;Therefore send to Joppa and invite Simon, who is also called Peter, to come to you; he is staying at the house of Simon the tanner by the sea.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	10	33	&ldquo;So I sent for you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come. Now then, we are all here present before God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	10	34	Opening his mouth, Peter said: &ldquo;I most certainly understand now that God is not one to show partiality,	44
NASB	Acts	10	35	But in every nation the man who fears Him and does what is right is welcome to Him.	44
NASB	Acts	10	36	&ldquo;The word which He sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all)&mdash;	44
NASB	Acts	10	37	You yourselves know the thing which took place throughout all Judea, starting from Galilee, after the baptism which John proclaimed.	44
NASB	Acts	10	38	&ldquo;You know of Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and with power, and how He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.	44
NASB	Acts	10	39	&ldquo;We are witnesses of all the things He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They also put Him to death by hanging Him on a cross.	44
NASB	Acts	10	4	And fixing his gaze on him and being much alarmed, he said, &ldquo;What is it, Lord?&rdquo; And he said to him, &ldquo;Your prayers and alms have ascended as a memorial before God.	44
NASB	Acts	10	40	&ldquo;God raised Him up on the third day and granted that He become visible,	44
NASB	Acts	10	41	Not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen beforehand by God, that is, to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead.	44
NASB	Acts	10	42	&ldquo;And He ordered us to preach to the people, and solemnly to testify that this is the One who has been appointed by God as Judge of the living and the dead.	44
NASB	Acts	10	43	&ldquo;Of Him all the prophets bear witness that through His name everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	10	44	While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were listening to the message.	44
NASB	Acts	10	45	All the circumcised believers who came with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also.	44
NASB	Acts	10	46	For they were hearing them speaking with tongues and exalting God. Then Peter answered,	44
NASB	Acts	10	47	&ldquo;Surely no one can refuse the water for these to be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did, can he?&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	10	48	And he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay on for a few days.	44
NASB	Acts	10	5	&ldquo;Now dispatch some men to Joppa and send for a man named Simon, who is also called Peter;	44
NASB	Acts	10	6	He is staying with a tanner named Simon, whose house is by the sea.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	10	7	When the angel who was speaking to him had left, he summoned two of his servants and a devout soldier of those who were his personal attendants,	44
NASB	Acts	10	8	And after he had explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.	44
NASB	Acts	10	9	On the next day, as they were on their way and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray.	44
NASB	Acts	11	1	Now the apostles and the brethren who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.	44
NASB	Acts	11	10	&ldquo;This happened three times, and everything was drawn back up into the sky.	44
NASB	Acts	11	11	&ldquo;And behold, at that moment three men appeared at the house in which we were staying, having been sent to me from Caesarea.	44
NASB	Acts	11	12	&ldquo;The Spirit told me to go with them without misgivings. These six brethren also went with me and we entered the man&rsquo;s house.	44
NASB	Acts	11	13	&ldquo;And he reported to us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying, &lsquo;Send to Joppa and have Simon, who is also called Peter, brought here;	44
NASB	Acts	11	14	And he will speak words to you by which you will be saved, you and all your household.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	11	15	&ldquo;And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as He did upon us at the beginning.	44
NASB	Acts	11	16	&ldquo;And I remembered the word of the Lord, how He used to say, &lsquo;John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	11	17	&ldquo;Therefore if God gave to them the same gift as He gave to us also after believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in God&rsquo;s way?&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	11	18	When they heard this, they quieted down and glorified God, saying, &ldquo;Well then, God has granted to the Gentiles also the repentance that leads to life.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	11	19	So then those who were scattered because of the persecution that occurred in connection with Stephen made their way to Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except to Jews alone.	44
NASB	Acts	11	2	And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those who were circumcised took issue with him,	44
NASB	Acts	11	20	But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who came to Antioch and began speaking to the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus.	44
NASB	Acts	11	21	And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number who believed turned to the Lord.	44
NASB	Acts	11	22	The news about them reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas off to Antioch.	44
NASB	Acts	11	23	Then when he arrived and witnessed the grace of God, he rejoiced and began to encourage them all with resolute heart to remain true to the Lord;	44
NASB	Acts	11	24	For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And considerable numbers were brought to the Lord.	44
NASB	Acts	11	25	And he left for Tarsus to look for Saul;	44
NASB	Acts	11	26	And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And for an entire year they met with the church and taught considerable numbers; and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.	44
NASB	Acts	11	27	Now at this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.	44
NASB	Acts	11	28	One of them named Agabus stood up and began to indicate by the Spirit that there would certainly be a great famine all over the world. And this took place in the reign of Claudius.	44
NASB	Acts	11	29	And in the proportion that any of the disciples had means, each of them determined to send a contribution for the relief of the brethren living in Judea.	44
NASB	Acts	11	3	Saying, &ldquo;You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	11	30	And this they did, sending it in charge of Barnabas and Saul to the elders.	44
NASB	Acts	11	4	But Peter began speaking and proceeded to explain to them in orderly sequence, saying,	44
NASB	Acts	11	5	&ldquo;I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, an object coming down like a great sheet lowered by four corners from the sky; and it came right down to me,	44
NASB	Acts	11	6	And when I had fixed my gaze on it and was observing it I saw the four-footed animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the crawling creatures and the birds of the air.	44
NASB	Acts	11	7	&ldquo;I also heard a voice saying to me, &lsquo;Get up, Peter; kill and eat.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	11	8	&ldquo;But I said, &lsquo;By no means, Lord, for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered my mouth.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	11	9	&ldquo;But a voice from heaven answered a second time, &lsquo;What God has cleansed, no longer consider unholy.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	12	1	Now about that time Herod the king laid hands on some who belonged to the church in order to mistreat them.	44
NASB	Acts	12	10	When they had passed the first and second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened for them by itself; and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel departed from him.	44
NASB	Acts	12	11	When Peter came to himself, he said, &ldquo;Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent forth His angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	12	12	And when he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also called Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.	44
NASB	Acts	12	13	When he knocked at the door of the gate, a servant-girl named Rhoda came to answer.	44
NASB	Acts	12	14	When she recognized Peter&rsquo;s voice, because of her joy she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter was standing in front of the gate.	44
NASB	Acts	12	15	They said to her, &ldquo;You are out of your mind!&rdquo; But she kept insisting that it was so. They kept saying, &ldquo;It is his angel.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	12	16	But Peter continued knocking; and when they had opened the door, they saw him and were amazed.	44
NASB	Acts	12	17	But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had led him out of the prison. And he said, &ldquo;Report these things to James and the brethren.&rdquo; Then he left and went to another place.	44
NASB	Acts	12	18	Now when day came, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers as to what could have become of Peter.	44
NASB	Acts	12	19	When Herod had searched for him and had not found him, he examined the guards and ordered that they be led away to execution. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and was spending time there.	44
NASB	Acts	12	2	And he had James the brother of John put to death with a sword.	44
NASB	Acts	12	20	Now he was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; and with one accord they came to him, and having won over Blastus the king&rsquo;s chamberlain, they were asking for peace, because their country was fed by the king&rsquo;s country.	44
NASB	Acts	12	21	On an appointed day Herod, having put on his royal apparel, took his seat on the rostrum and began delivering an address to them.	44
NASB	Acts	12	22	The people kept crying out, &ldquo;The voice of a god and not of a man!&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	12	23	And immediately an angel of the Lord struck him because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and died.	44
NASB	Acts	12	24	But the word of the Lord continued to grow and to be multiplied.	44
NASB	Acts	12	25	And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their mission, taking along with them John, who was also called Mark.	44
NASB	Acts	12	3	When he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. Now it was during the days of Unleavened Bread.	44
NASB	Acts	12	4	When he had seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out before the people.	44
NASB	Acts	12	5	So Peter was kept in the prison, but prayer for him was being made fervently by the church to God.	44
NASB	Acts	12	6	On the very night when Herod was about to bring him forward, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and guards in front of the door were watching over the prison.	44
NASB	Acts	12	7	And behold, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter&rsquo;s side and woke him up, saying, &ldquo;Get up quickly.&rdquo; And his chains fell off his hands.	44
NASB	Acts	12	8	And the angel said to him, &ldquo;Gird yourself and put on your sandals.&rdquo; And he did so. And he said to him, &ldquo;Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	12	9	And he went out and continued to follow, and he did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision.	44
NASB	Acts	13	1	Now there were at Antioch, in the church that was there, prophets and teachers: Barnabas, and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.	44
NASB	Acts	13	10	And said, &ldquo;You who are full of all deceit and fraud, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to make crooked the straight ways of the Lord?	44
NASB	Acts	13	11	&ldquo;Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and not see the sun for a time.&rdquo; And immediately a mist and a darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking those who would lead him by the hand.	44
NASB	Acts	13	12	Then the proconsul believed when he saw what had happened, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord.	44
NASB	Acts	13	13	Now Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia; but John left them and returned to Jerusalem.	44
NASB	Acts	13	14	But going on from Perga, they arrived at Pisidian Antioch, and on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.	44
NASB	Acts	13	15	After the reading of the Law and the Prophets the synagogue officials sent to them, saying, &ldquo;Brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	13	16	Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said, &ldquo;Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen:	44
NASB	Acts	13	17	&ldquo;The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm He led them out from it.	44
NASB	Acts	13	18	&ldquo;For a period of about forty years He put up with them in the wilderness.	44
NASB	Acts	13	19	&ldquo;When He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He distributed their land as an inheritance&mdash;all of which took about four hundred and fifty years.	44
NASB	Acts	13	2	While they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, &ldquo;Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	13	20	&ldquo;After these things He gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.	44
NASB	Acts	13	21	&ldquo;Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.	44
NASB	Acts	13	22	&ldquo;After He had removed him, He raised up David to be their king, concerning whom He also testified and said, &lsquo;I HAVE FOUND DAVID the son of Jesse, A MAN AFTER MY HEART, who will do all My will.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	13	23	&ldquo;From the descendants of this man, according to promise, God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus,	44
NASB	Acts	13	24	After John had proclaimed before His coming a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.	44
NASB	Acts	13	25	&ldquo;And while John was completing his course, he kept saying, &lsquo;What do you suppose that I am? I am not He. But behold, one is coming after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	13	26	&ldquo;Brethren, sons of Abraham&rsquo;s family, and those among you who fear God, to us the message of this salvation has been sent.	44
NASB	Acts	13	27	&ldquo;For those who live in Jerusalem, and their rulers, recognizing neither Him nor the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled these by condemning Him.	44
NASB	Acts	13	28	&ldquo;And though they found no ground for putting Him to death, they asked Pilate that He be executed.	44
NASB	Acts	13	29	&ldquo;When they had carried out all that was written concerning Him, they took Him down from the cross and laid Him in a tomb.	44
NASB	Acts	13	3	Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.	44
NASB	Acts	13	30	&ldquo;But God raised Him from the dead;	44
NASB	Acts	13	31	And for many days He appeared to those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, the very ones who are now His witnesses to the people.	44
NASB	Acts	13	32	&ldquo;And we preach to you the good news of the promise made to the fathers,	44
NASB	Acts	13	33	That God has fulfilled this promise to our children in that He raised up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm, &lsquo;YOU ARE MY SON; TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	13	34	&ldquo;As for the fact that He raised Him up from the dead, no longer to return to decay, He has spoken in this way: &lsquo;I WILL GIVE YOU THE HOLY and SURE blessings OF DAVID.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	13	35	&ldquo;Therefore He also says in another Psalm, &lsquo;YOU WILL NOT ALLOW YOUR HOLY ONE TO UNDERGO DECAY.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	13	36	&ldquo;For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep, and was laid among his fathers and underwent decay;	44
NASB	Acts	13	37	But He whom God raised did not undergo decay.	44
NASB	Acts	13	38	&ldquo;Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,	44
NASB	Acts	13	39	And through Him everyone who believes is freed from all things, from which you could not be freed through the Law of Moses.	44
NASB	Acts	13	4	So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia and from there they sailed to Cyprus.	44
NASB	Acts	13	40	&ldquo;Therefore take heed, so that the thing spoken of in the Prophets may not come upon you:	44
NASB	Acts	13	41	&lsquo;BEHOLD, YOU SCOFFERS, AND MARVEL, AND PERISH; FOR I AM ACCOMPLISHING A WORK IN YOUR DAYS, A WORK WHICH YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE, THOUGH SOMEONE SHOULD DESCRIBE IT TO YOU.&rsquo;&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	13	42	As Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people kept begging that these things might be spoken to them the next Sabbath.	44
NASB	Acts	13	43	Now when the meeting of the synagogue had broken up, many of the Jews and of the God-fearing proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, were urging them to continue in the grace of God.	44
NASB	Acts	13	44	The next Sabbath nearly the whole city assembled to hear the word of the Lord.	44
NASB	Acts	13	45	But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began contradicting the things spoken by Paul, and were blaspheming.	44
NASB	Acts	13	46	Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said, &ldquo;It was necessary that the word of God be spoken to you first; since you repudiate it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles.	44
NASB	Acts	13	47	&ldquo;For so the Lord has commanded us, &lsquo;I HAVE PLACED YOU AS A LIGHT FOR THE GENTILES, THAT YOU MAY BRING SALVATION TO THE END OF THE EARTH.&rsquo;&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	13	48	When the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord; and as many as had been appointed to eternal life believed.	44
NASB	Acts	13	49	And the word of the Lord was being spread through the whole region.	44
NASB	Acts	13	5	When they reached Salamis, they began to proclaim the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews; and they also had John as their helper.	44
NASB	Acts	13	50	But the Jews incited the devout women of prominence and the leading men of the city, and instigated a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district.	44
NASB	Acts	13	51	But they shook off the dust of their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium.	44
NASB	Acts	13	52	And the disciples were continually filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.	44
NASB	Acts	13	6	When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a magician, a Jewish false prophet whose name was Bar-Jesus,	44
NASB	Acts	13	7	Who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God.	44
NASB	Acts	13	8	But Elymas the magician (for so his name is translated) was opposing them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.	44
NASB	Acts	13	9	But Saul, who was also known as Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fixed his gaze on him,	44
NASB	Acts	14	1	In Iconium they entered the synagogue of the Jews together, and spoke in such a manner that a large number of people believed, both of Jews and of Greeks.	44
NASB	Acts	14	10	Said with a loud voice, &ldquo;Stand upright on your feet.&rdquo; And he leaped up and began to walk.	44
NASB	Acts	14	11	When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they raised their voice, saying in the Lycaonian language, &ldquo;The gods have become like men and have come down to us.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	14	12	And they began calling Barnabas, Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker.	44
NASB	Acts	14	13	The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds.	44
NASB	Acts	14	14	But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their robes and rushed out into the crowd, crying out	44
NASB	Acts	14	15	And saying, &ldquo;Men, why are you doing these things? We are also men of the same nature as you, and preach the gospel to you that you should turn from these vain things to a living God, WHO MADE THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH AND THE SEA AND ALL THAT IS IN THEM.	44
NASB	Acts	14	16	&ldquo;In the generations gone by He permitted all the nations to go their own ways;	44
NASB	Acts	14	17	And yet He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	14	18	Even saying these things, with difficulty they restrained the crowds from offering sacrifice to them.	44
NASB	Acts	14	19	But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having won over the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead.	44
NASB	Acts	14	2	But the Jews who disbelieved stirred up the minds of the Gentiles and embittered them against the brethren.	44
NASB	Acts	14	20	But while the disciples stood around him, he got up and entered the city. The next day he went away with Barnabas to Derbe.	44
NASB	Acts	14	21	After they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch,	44
NASB	Acts	14	22	Strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying, &ldquo;Through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	14	23	When they had appointed elders for them in every church, having prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed.	44
NASB	Acts	14	24	They passed through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia.	44
NASB	Acts	14	25	When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.	44
NASB	Acts	14	26	From there they sailed to Antioch, from which they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had accomplished.	44
NASB	Acts	14	27	When they had arrived and gathered the church together, they began to report all things that God had done with them and how He had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.	44
NASB	Acts	14	28	And they spent a long time with the disciples.	44
NASB	Acts	14	3	Therefore they spent a long time there speaking boldly with reliance upon the Lord, who was testifying to the word of His grace, granting that signs and wonders be done by their hands.	44
NASB	Acts	14	4	But the people of the city were divided; and some sided with the Jews, and some with the apostles.	44
NASB	Acts	14	5	And when an attempt was made by both the Gentiles and the Jews with their rulers, to mistreat and to stone them,	44
NASB	Acts	14	6	They became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding region;	44
NASB	Acts	14	7	And there they continued to preach the gospel.	44
NASB	Acts	14	8	At Lystra a man was sitting who had no strength in his feet, lame from his mother&rsquo;s womb, who had never walked.	44
NASB	Acts	14	9	This man was listening to Paul as he spoke, who, when he had fixed his gaze on him and had seen that he had faith to be made well,	44
NASB	Acts	15	1	Some men came down from Judea and began teaching the brethren, &ldquo;Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	15	10	&ldquo;Now therefore why do you put God to the test by placing upon the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?	44
NASB	Acts	15	11	&ldquo;But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same way as they also are.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	15	12	All the people kept silent, and they were listening to Barnabas and Paul as they were relating what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.	44
NASB	Acts	15	13	After they had stopped speaking, James answered, saying, &ldquo;Brethren, listen to me.	44
NASB	Acts	15	14	&ldquo;Simeon has related how God first concerned Himself about taking from among the Gentiles a people for His name.	44
NASB	Acts	15	15	&ldquo;With this the words of the Prophets agree, just as it is written,	44
NASB	Acts	15	16	&lsquo;AFTER THESE THINGS I will return, AND I WILL REBUILD THE TABERNACLE OF DAVID WHICH HAS FALLEN, AND I WILL REBUILD ITS RUINS, AND I WILL RESTORE IT,	44
NASB	Acts	15	17	SO THAT THE REST OF MANKIND MAY SEEK THE LORD, AND ALL THE GENTILES WHO ARE CALLED BY MY NAME,&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	15	18	SAYS THE LORD, WHO MAKES THESE THINGS KNOWN FROM LONG AGO.	44
NASB	Acts	15	19	&ldquo;Therefore it is my judgment that we do not trouble those who are turning to God from among the Gentiles,	44
NASB	Acts	15	2	And when Paul and Barnabas had great dissension and debate with them, the brethren determined that Paul and Barnabas and some others of them should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders concerning this issue.	44
NASB	Acts	15	20	But that we write to them that they abstain from things contaminated by idols and from fornication and from what is strangled and from blood.	44
NASB	Acts	15	21	&ldquo;For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who preach him, since he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	15	22	Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas&mdash;Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren,	44
NASB	Acts	15	23	And they sent this letter by them, &ldquo;The apostles and the brethren who are elders, to the brethren in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia who are from the Gentiles, greetings.	44
NASB	Acts	15	24	&ldquo;Since we have heard that some of our number to whom we gave no instruction have disturbed you with their words, unsettling your souls,	44
NASB	Acts	15	25	It seemed good to us, having become of one mind, to select men to send to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,	44
NASB	Acts	15	26	Men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.	44
NASB	Acts	15	27	&ldquo;Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will also report the same things by word of mouth.	44
NASB	Acts	15	28	&ldquo;For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these essentials:	44
NASB	Acts	15	29	That you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication; if you keep yourselves free from such things, you will do well. Farewell.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	15	3	Therefore, being sent on their way by the church, they were passing through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and were bringing great joy to all the brethren.	44
NASB	Acts	15	30	So when they were sent away, they went down to Antioch; and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter.	44
NASB	Acts	15	31	When they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement.	44
NASB	Acts	15	32	Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, encouraged and strengthened the brethren with a lengthy message.	44
NASB	Acts	15	33	After they had spent time there, they were sent away from the brethren in peace to those who had sent them out.	44
NASB	Acts	15	34	[But it seemed good to Silas to remain there.]	44
NASB	Acts	15	35	But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and preaching with many others also, the word of the Lord.	44
NASB	Acts	15	36	After some days Paul said to Barnabas, &ldquo;Let us return and visit the brethren in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	15	37	Barnabas wanted to take John, called Mark, along with them also.	44
NASB	Acts	15	38	But Paul kept insisting that they should not take him along who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work.	44
NASB	Acts	15	39	And there occurred such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus.	44
NASB	Acts	15	4	When they arrived at Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all that God had done with them.	44
NASB	Acts	15	40	But Paul chose Silas and left, being committed by the brethren to the grace of the Lord.	44
NASB	Acts	15	41	And he was traveling through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.	44
NASB	Acts	15	5	But some of the sect of the Pharisees who had believed stood up, saying, &ldquo;It is necessary to circumcise them and to direct them to observe the Law of Moses.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	15	6	The apostles and the elders came together to look into this matter.	44
NASB	Acts	15	7	After there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, &ldquo;Brethren, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles would hear the word of the gospel and believe.	44
NASB	Acts	15	8	&ldquo;And God, who knows the heart, testified to them giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He also did to us;	44
NASB	Acts	15	9	And He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.	44
NASB	Acts	16	1	Paul came also to Derbe and to Lystra. And a disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek,	44
NASB	Acts	16	10	When he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.	44
NASB	Acts	16	11	So putting out to sea from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and on the day following to Neapolis;	44
NASB	Acts	16	12	And from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia, a Roman colony; and we were staying in this city for some days.	44
NASB	Acts	16	13	And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to a riverside, where we were supposing that there would be a place of prayer; and we sat down and began speaking to the women who had assembled.	44
NASB	Acts	16	14	A woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple fabrics, a worshiper of God, was listening; and the Lord opened her heart to respond to the things spoken by Paul.	44
NASB	Acts	16	15	And when she and her household had been baptized, she urged us, saying, &ldquo;If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay.&rdquo; And she prevailed upon us.	44
NASB	Acts	16	16	It happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, a slave-girl having a spirit of divination met us, who was bringing her masters much profit by fortune-telling.	44
NASB	Acts	16	17	Following after Paul and us, she kept crying out, saying, &ldquo;These men are bond-servants of the Most High God, who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	16	18	She continued doing this for many days. But Paul was greatly annoyed, and turned and said to the spirit, &ldquo;I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!&rdquo; And it came out at that very moment.	44
NASB	Acts	16	19	But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the market place before the authorities,	44
NASB	Acts	16	2	And he was well spoken of by the brethren who were in Lystra and Iconium.	44
NASB	Acts	16	20	And when they had brought them to the chief magistrates, they said, &ldquo;These men are throwing our city into confusion, being Jews,	44
NASB	Acts	16	21	And are proclaiming customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe, being Romans.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	16	22	The crowd rose up together against them, and the chief magistrates tore their robes off them and proceeded to order them to be beaten with rods.	44
NASB	Acts	16	23	When they had struck them with many blows, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to guard them securely;	44
NASB	Acts	16	24	And he, having received such a command, threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.	44
NASB	Acts	16	25	But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God, and the prisoners were listening to them;	44
NASB	Acts	16	26	And suddenly there came a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison house were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone&rsquo;s chains were unfastened.	44
NASB	Acts	16	27	When the jailer awoke and saw the prison doors opened, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.	44
NASB	Acts	16	28	But Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying, &ldquo;Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	16	29	And he called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas,	44
NASB	Acts	16	3	Paul wanted this man to go with him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.	44
NASB	Acts	16	30	And after he brought them out, he said, &ldquo;Sirs, what must I do to be saved?&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	16	31	They said, &ldquo;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	16	32	And they spoke the word of the Lord to him together with all who were in his house.	44
NASB	Acts	16	33	And he took them that very hour of the night and washed their wounds, and immediately he was baptized, he and all his household.	44
NASB	Acts	16	34	And he brought them into his house and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, having believed in God with his whole household.	44
NASB	Acts	16	35	Now when day came, the chief magistrates sent their policemen, saying, &ldquo;Release those men.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	16	36	And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, &ldquo;The chief magistrates have sent to release you. Therefore come out now and go in peace.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	16	37	But Paul said to them, &ldquo;They have beaten us in public without trial, men who are Romans, and have thrown us into prison; and now are they sending us away secretly? No indeed! But let them come themselves and bring us out.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	16	38	The policemen reported these words to the chief magistrates. They were afraid when they heard that they were Romans,	44
NASB	Acts	16	39	And they came and appealed to them, and when they had brought them out, they kept begging them to leave the city.	44
NASB	Acts	16	4	Now while they were passing through the cities, they were delivering the decrees which had been decided upon by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem, for them to observe.	44
NASB	Acts	16	40	They went out of the prison and entered the house of Lydia, and when they saw the brethren, they encouraged them and departed.	44
NASB	Acts	16	5	So the churches were being strengthened in the faith, and were increasing in number daily.	44
NASB	Acts	16	6	They passed through the Phrygian and Galatian region, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia;	44
NASB	Acts	16	7	And after they came to Mysia, they were trying to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them;	44
NASB	Acts	16	8	And passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.	44
NASB	Acts	16	9	A vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing and appealing to him, and saying, &ldquo;Come over to Macedonia and help us.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	17	1	Now when they had traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.	44
NASB	Acts	17	10	The brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.	44
NASB	Acts	17	11	Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.	44
NASB	Acts	17	12	Therefore many of them believed, along with a number of prominent Greek women and men.	44
NASB	Acts	17	13	But when the Jews of Thessalonica found out that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul in Berea also, they came there as well, agitating and stirring up the crowds.	44
NASB	Acts	17	14	Then immediately the brethren sent Paul out to go as far as the sea; and Silas and Timothy remained there.	44
NASB	Acts	17	15	Now those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they left.	44
NASB	Acts	17	16	Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was being provoked within him as he was observing the city full of idols.	44
NASB	Acts	17	17	So he was reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles, and in the market place every day with those who happened to be present.	44
NASB	Acts	17	18	And also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him. Some were saying, &ldquo;What would this idle babbler wish to say?&rdquo; Others, &ldquo;He seems to be a proclaimer of strange deities,&rdquo;&mdash;because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection.	44
NASB	Acts	17	19	And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, &ldquo;May we know what this new teaching is which you are proclaiming?	44
NASB	Acts	17	2	And according to Paul&rsquo;s custom, he went to them, and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures,	44
NASB	Acts	17	20	&ldquo;For you are bringing some strange things to our ears; so we want to know what these things mean.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	17	21	(Now all the Athenians and the strangers visiting there used to spend their time in nothing other than telling or hearing something new.)	44
NASB	Acts	17	22	So Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, &ldquo;Men of Athens, I observe that you are very religious in all respects.	44
NASB	Acts	17	23	&ldquo;For while I was passing through and examining the objects of your worship, I also found an altar with this inscription, &lsquo;TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.&rsquo; Therefore what you worship in ignorance, this I proclaim to you.	44
NASB	Acts	17	24	&ldquo;The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands;	44
NASB	Acts	17	25	Nor is He served by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all people life and breath and all things;	44
NASB	Acts	17	26	And He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation,	44
NASB	Acts	17	27	That they would seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us;	44
NASB	Acts	17	28	For in Him we live and move and exist, as even some of your own poets have said, &lsquo;For we also are His children.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	17	29	&ldquo;Being then the children of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and thought of man.	44
NASB	Acts	17	3	Explaining and giving evidence that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, &ldquo;This Jesus whom I am proclaiming to you is the Christ.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	17	30	&ldquo;Therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance, God is now declaring to men that all people everywhere should repent,	44
NASB	Acts	17	31	Because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to all men by raising Him from the dead.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	17	32	Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some began to sneer, but others said, &ldquo;We shall hear you again concerning this.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	17	33	So Paul went out of their midst.	44
NASB	Acts	17	34	But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them.	44
NASB	Acts	17	4	And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, along with a large number of the God-fearing Greeks and a number of the leading women.	44
NASB	Acts	17	5	But the Jews, becoming jealous and taking along some wicked men from the market place, formed a mob and set the city in an uproar; and attacking the house of Jason, they were seeking to bring them out to the people.	44
NASB	Acts	17	6	When they did not find them, they began dragging Jason and some brethren before the city authorities, shouting, &ldquo;These men who have upset the world have come here also;	44
NASB	Acts	17	7	And Jason has welcomed them, and they all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	17	8	They stirred up the crowd and the city authorities who heard these things.	44
NASB	Acts	17	9	And when they had received a pledge from Jason and the others, they released them.	44
NASB	Acts	18	1	After these things he left Athens and went to Corinth.	44
NASB	Acts	18	10	For I am with you, and no man will attack you in order to harm you, for I have many people in this city.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	18	11	And he settled there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.	44
NASB	Acts	18	12	But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,	44
NASB	Acts	18	13	Saying, &ldquo;This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	18	14	But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, &ldquo;If it were a matter of wrong or of vicious crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to put up with you;	44
NASB	Acts	18	15	But if there are questions about words and names and your own law, look after it yourselves; I am unwilling to be a judge of these matters.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	18	16	And he drove them away from the judgment seat.	44
NASB	Acts	18	17	And they all took hold of Sosthenes, the leader of the synagogue, and began beating him in front of the judgment seat. But Gallio was not concerned about any of these things.	44
NASB	Acts	18	18	Paul, having remained many days longer, took leave of the brethren and put out to sea for Syria, and with him were Priscilla and Aquila. In Cenchrea he had his hair cut, for he was keeping a vow.	44
NASB	Acts	18	19	They came to Ephesus, and he left them there. Now he himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.	44
NASB	Acts	18	2	And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, having recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. He came to them,	44
NASB	Acts	18	20	When they asked him to stay for a longer time, he did not consent,	44
NASB	Acts	18	21	But taking leave of them and saying, &ldquo;I will return to you again if God wills,&rdquo; he set sail from Ephesus.	44
NASB	Acts	18	22	When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and went down to Antioch.	44
NASB	Acts	18	23	And having spent some time there, he left and passed successively through the Galatian region and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.	44
NASB	Acts	18	24	Now a Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the Scriptures.	44
NASB	Acts	18	25	This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things concerning Jesus, being acquainted only with the baptism of John;	44
NASB	Acts	18	26	And he began to speak out boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.	44
NASB	Acts	18	27	And when he wanted to go across to Achaia, the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him; and when he had arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace,	44
NASB	Acts	18	28	For he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, demonstrating by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.	44
NASB	Acts	18	3	And because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them and they were working, for by trade they were tent-makers.	44
NASB	Acts	18	4	And he was reasoning in the synagogue every Sabbath and trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.	44
NASB	Acts	18	5	But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul began devoting himself completely to the word, solemnly testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.	44
NASB	Acts	18	6	But when they resisted and blasphemed, he shook out his garments and said to them, &ldquo;Your blood be on your own heads! I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	18	7	Then he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was next to the synagogue.	44
NASB	Acts	18	8	Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his household, and many of the Corinthians when they heard were believing and being baptized.	44
NASB	Acts	18	9	And the Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, &ldquo;Do not be afraid any longer, but go on speaking and do not be silent;	44
NASB	Acts	19	1	It happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the upper country and came to Ephesus, and found some disciples.	44
NASB	Acts	19	10	This took place for two years, so that all who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.	44
NASB	Acts	19	11	God was performing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,	44
NASB	Acts	19	12	So that handkerchiefs or aprons were even carried from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out.	44
NASB	Acts	19	13	But also some of the Jewish exorcists, who went from place to place, attempted to name over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, &ldquo;I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	19	14	Seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this.	44
NASB	Acts	19	15	And the evil spirit answered and said to them, &ldquo;I recognize Jesus, and I know about Paul, but who are you?&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	19	16	And the man, in whom was the evil spirit, leaped on them and subdued all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.	44
NASB	Acts	19	17	This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified.	44
NASB	Acts	19	18	Many also of those who had believed kept coming, confessing and disclosing their practices.	44
NASB	Acts	19	19	And many of those who practiced magic brought their books together and began burning them in the sight of everyone; and they counted up the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.	44
NASB	Acts	19	2	He said to them, &ldquo;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?&rdquo; And they said to him, &ldquo;No, we have not even heard whether there is a Holy Spirit.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	19	20	So the word of the Lord was growing mightily and prevailing.	44
NASB	Acts	19	21	Now after these things were finished, Paul purposed in the Spirit to go to Jerusalem after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, &ldquo;After I have been there, I must also see Rome.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	19	22	And having sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.	44
NASB	Acts	19	23	About that time there occurred no small disturbance concerning the Way.	44
NASB	Acts	19	24	For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, was bringing no little business to the craftsmen;	44
NASB	Acts	19	25	These he gathered together with the workmen of similar trades, and said, &ldquo;Men, you know that our prosperity depends upon this business.	44
NASB	Acts	19	26	&ldquo;You see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but in almost all of Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable number of people, saying that gods made with hands are no gods at all.	44
NASB	Acts	19	27	&ldquo;Not only is there danger that this trade of ours fall into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis be regarded as worthless and that she whom all of Asia and the world worship will even be dethroned from her magnificence.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	19	28	When they heard this and were filled with rage, they began crying out, saying, &ldquo;Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	19	29	The city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul&rsquo;s traveling companions from Macedonia.	44
NASB	Acts	19	3	And he said, &ldquo;Into what then were you baptized?&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;Into John&rsquo;s baptism.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	19	30	And when Paul wanted to go into the assembly, the disciples would not let him.	44
NASB	Acts	19	31	Also some of the Asiarchs who were friends of his sent to him and repeatedly urged him not to venture into the theater.	44
NASB	Acts	19	32	So then, some were shouting one thing and some another, for the assembly was in confusion and the majority did not know for what reason they had come together.	44
NASB	Acts	19	33	Some of the crowd concluded it was Alexander, since the Jews had put him forward; and having motioned with his hand, Alexander was intending to make a defense to the assembly.	44
NASB	Acts	19	34	But when they recognized that he was a Jew, a single outcry arose from them all as they shouted for about two hours, &ldquo;Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	19	35	After quieting the crowd, the town clerk said, &ldquo;Men of Ephesus, what man is there after all who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of the image which fell down from heaven?	44
NASB	Acts	19	36	&ldquo;So, since these are undeniable facts, you ought to keep calm and to do nothing rash.	44
NASB	Acts	19	37	&ldquo;For you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.	44
NASB	Acts	19	38	&ldquo;So then, if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a complaint against any man, the courts are in session and proconsuls are available; let them bring charges against one another.	44
NASB	Acts	19	39	&ldquo;But if you want anything beyond this, it shall be settled in the lawful assembly.	44
NASB	Acts	19	4	Paul said, &ldquo;John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in Him who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	19	40	&ldquo;For indeed we are in danger of being accused of a riot in connection with today&rsquo;s events, since there is no real cause for it, and in this connection we will be unable to account for this disorderly gathering.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	19	41	After saying this he dismissed the assembly.	44
NASB	Acts	19	5	When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.	44
NASB	Acts	19	6	And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began speaking with tongues and prophesying.	44
NASB	Acts	19	7	There were in all about twelve men.	44
NASB	Acts	19	8	And he entered the synagogue and continued speaking out boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God.	44
NASB	Acts	19	9	But when some were becoming hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the people, he withdrew from them and took away the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.	44
NASB	Acts	2	1	When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place.	44
NASB	Acts	2	10	Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the districts of Libya around Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,	44
NASB	Acts	2	11	Cretans and Arabs&mdash;we hear them in our own tongues speaking of the mighty deeds of God.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	2	12	And they all continued in amazement and great perplexity, saying to one another, &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	2	13	But others were mocking and saying, &ldquo;They are full of sweet wine.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	2	14	But Peter, taking his stand with the eleven, raised his voice and declared to them: &ldquo;Men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you and give heed to my words.	44
NASB	Acts	2	15	&ldquo;For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only the third hour of the day;	44
NASB	Acts	2	16	But this is what was spoken of through the prophet Joel:	44
NASB	Acts	2	17	&lsquo;AND IT SHALL BE IN THE LAST DAYS,&rsquo; God says, &lsquo;THAT I WILL POUR FORTH OF MY SPIRIT ON ALL MANKIND; AND YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS SHALL PROPHESY, AND YOUR YOUNG MEN SHALL SEE VISIONS, AND YOUR OLD MEN SHALL DREAM DREAMS;	44
NASB	Acts	2	18	EVEN ON MY BONDSLAVES, BOTH MEN AND WOMEN, I WILL IN THOSE DAYS POUR FORTH OF MY SPIRIT And they shall prophesy.	44
NASB	Acts	2	19	&lsquo;AND I WILL GRANT WONDERS IN THE SKY ABOVE AND SIGNS ON THE EARTH BELOW, BLOOD, AND FIRE, AND VAPOR OF SMOKE.	44
NASB	Acts	2	2	And suddenly there came from heaven a noise like a violent rushing wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.	44
NASB	Acts	2	20	&lsquo;THE SUN WILL BE TURNED INTO DARKNESS AND THE MOON INTO BLOOD, BEFORE THE GREAT AND GLORIOUS DAY OF THE LORD SHALL COME.	44
NASB	Acts	2	21	&lsquo;AND IT SHALL BE THAT EVERYONE WHO CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	2	22	&ldquo;Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God performed through Him in your midst, just as you yourselves know&mdash;	44
NASB	Acts	2	23	This Man, delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put Him to death.	44
NASB	Acts	2	24	&ldquo;But God raised Him up again, putting an end to the agony of death, since it was impossible for Him to be held in its power.	44
NASB	Acts	2	25	&ldquo;For David says of Him, &lsquo;I SAW THE LORD ALWAYS IN MY PRESENCE; FOR HE IS AT MY RIGHT HAND, SO THAT I WILL NOT BE SHAKEN.	44
NASB	Acts	2	26	&lsquo;THEREFORE MY HEART WAS GLAD AND MY TONGUE EXULTED; MOREOVER MY FLESH ALSO WILL LIVE IN HOPE;	44
NASB	Acts	2	27	BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT ABANDON MY SOUL TO HADES, NOR ALLOW YOUR HOLY ONE TO UNDERGO DECAY.	44
NASB	Acts	2	28	&lsquo;YOU HAVE MADE KNOWN TO ME THE WAYS OF LIFE; YOU WILL MAKE ME FULL OF GLADNESS WITH YOUR PRESENCE.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	2	29	&ldquo;Brethren, I may confidently say to you regarding the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.	44
NASB	Acts	2	3	And there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves, and they rested on each one of them.	44
NASB	Acts	2	30	&ldquo;And so, because he was a prophet and knew that GOD HAD SWORN TO HIM WITH AN OATH TO SEAT one OF HIS DESCENDANTS ON HIS THRONE,	44
NASB	Acts	2	31	He looked ahead and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that HE WAS NEITHER ABANDONED TO HADES, NOR DID His flesh SUFFER DECAY.	44
NASB	Acts	2	32	&ldquo;This Jesus God raised up again, to which we are all witnesses.	44
NASB	Acts	2	33	&ldquo;Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He has poured forth this which you both see and hear.	44
NASB	Acts	2	34	&ldquo;For it was not David who ascended into heaven, but he himself says: &lsquo;THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD, &ldquo;SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND,	44
NASB	Acts	2	35	UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET.&rsquo;&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	2	36	&ldquo;Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made Him both Lord and Christ&mdash;this Jesus whom you crucified.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	2	37	Now when they heard this, they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, &ldquo;Brethren, what shall we do?&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	2	38	Peter said to them, &ldquo;Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.	44
NASB	Acts	2	39	&ldquo;For the promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God will call to Himself.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	2	4	And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit was giving them utterance.	44
NASB	Acts	2	40	And with many other words he solemnly testified and kept on exhorting them, saying, &ldquo;Be saved from this perverse generation!&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	2	41	So then, those who had received his word were baptized; and that day there were added about three thousand souls.	44
NASB	Acts	2	42	They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles&rsquo; teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.	44
NASB	Acts	2	43	Everyone kept feeling a sense of awe; and many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles.	44
NASB	Acts	2	44	And all those who had believed were together and had all things in common;	44
NASB	Acts	2	45	And they began selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with all, as anyone might have need.	44
NASB	Acts	2	46	Day by day continuing with one mind in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they were taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of heart,	44
NASB	Acts	2	47	Praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being saved.	44
NASB	Acts	2	5	Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven.	44
NASB	Acts	2	6	And when this sound occurred, the crowd came together, and were bewildered because each one of them was hearing them speak in his own language.	44
NASB	Acts	2	7	They were amazed and astonished, saying, &ldquo;Why, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?	44
NASB	Acts	2	8	&ldquo;And how is it that we each hear them in our own language to which we were born?	44
NASB	Acts	2	9	&ldquo;Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,	44
NASB	Acts	20	1	After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and when he had exhorted them and taken his leave of them, he left to go to Macedonia.	44
NASB	Acts	20	10	But Paul went down and fell upon him, and after embracing him, he said, &ldquo;Do not be troubled, for his life is in him.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	20	11	When he had gone back up and had broken the bread and eaten, he talked with them a long while until daybreak, and then left.	44
NASB	Acts	20	12	They took away the boy alive, and were greatly comforted.	44
NASB	Acts	20	13	But we, going ahead to the ship, set sail for Assos, intending from there to take Paul on board; for so he had arranged it, intending himself to go by land.	44
NASB	Acts	20	14	And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene.	44
NASB	Acts	20	15	Sailing from there, we arrived the following day opposite Chios; and the next day we crossed over to Samos; and the day following we came to Miletus.	44
NASB	Acts	20	16	For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so that he would not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.	44
NASB	Acts	20	17	From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to him the elders of the church.	44
NASB	Acts	20	18	And when they had come to him, he said to them, &ldquo;You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you the whole time,	44
NASB	Acts	20	19	Serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials which came upon me through the plots of the Jews;	44
NASB	Acts	20	2	When he had gone through those districts and had given them much exhortation, he came to Greece.	44
NASB	Acts	20	20	How I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly and from house to house,	44
NASB	Acts	20	21	Solemnly testifying to both Jews and Greeks of repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.	44
NASB	Acts	20	22	&ldquo;And now, behold, bound by the Spirit, I am on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,	44
NASB	Acts	20	23	Except that the Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.	44
NASB	Acts	20	24	&ldquo;But I do not consider my life of any account as dear to myself, so that I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify solemnly of the gospel of the grace of God.	44
NASB	Acts	20	25	&ldquo;And now, behold, I know that all of you, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, will no longer see my face.	44
NASB	Acts	20	26	&ldquo;Therefore, I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men.	44
NASB	Acts	20	27	&ldquo;For I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole purpose of God.	44
NASB	Acts	20	28	&ldquo;Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood.	44
NASB	Acts	20	29	&ldquo;I know that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock;	44
NASB	Acts	20	3	And there he spent three months, and when a plot was formed against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.	44
NASB	Acts	20	30	And from among your own selves men will arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.	44
NASB	Acts	20	31	&ldquo;Therefore be on the alert, remembering that night and day for a period of three years I did not cease to admonish each one with tears.	44
NASB	Acts	20	32	&ldquo;And now I commend you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.	44
NASB	Acts	20	33	&ldquo;I have coveted no one&rsquo;s silver or gold or clothes.	44
NASB	Acts	20	34	&ldquo;You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my own needs and to the men who were with me.	44
NASB	Acts	20	35	&ldquo;In everything I showed you that by working hard in this manner you must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, &lsquo;It is more blessed to give than to receive.&rsquo;&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	20	36	When he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.	44
NASB	Acts	20	37	And they began to weep aloud and embraced Paul, and repeatedly kissed him,	44
NASB	Acts	20	38	Grieving especially over the word which he had spoken, that they would not see his face again. And they were accompanying him to the ship.	44
NASB	Acts	20	4	And he was accompanied by Sopater of Berea, the son of Pyrrhus, and by Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.	44
NASB	Acts	20	5	But these had gone on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas.	44
NASB	Acts	20	6	We sailed from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and came to them at Troas within five days; and there we stayed seven days.	44
NASB	Acts	20	7	On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul began talking to them, intending to leave the next day, and he prolonged his message until midnight.	44
NASB	Acts	20	8	There were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered together.	44
NASB	Acts	20	9	And there was a young man named Eutychus sitting on the window sill, sinking into a deep sleep; and as Paul kept on talking, he was overcome by sleep and fell down from the third floor and was picked up dead.	44
NASB	Acts	21	1	When we had parted from them and had set sail, we ran a straight course to Cos and the next day to Rhodes and from there to Patara;	44
NASB	Acts	21	10	As we were staying there for some days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.	44
NASB	Acts	21	11	And coming to us, he took Paul&rsquo;s belt and bound his own feet and hands, and said, &ldquo;This is what the Holy Spirit says: &lsquo;In this way the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.&rsquo;&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	21	12	When we had heard this, we as well as the local residents began begging him not to go up to Jerusalem.	44
NASB	Acts	21	13	Then Paul answered, &ldquo;What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	21	14	And since he would not be persuaded, we fell silent, remarking, &ldquo;The will of the Lord be done!&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	21	15	After these days we got ready and started on our way up to Jerusalem.	44
NASB	Acts	21	16	Some of the disciples from Caesarea also came with us, taking us to Mnason of Cyprus, a disciple of long standing with whom we were to lodge.	44
NASB	Acts	21	17	After we arrived in Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.	44
NASB	Acts	21	18	And the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.	44
NASB	Acts	21	19	After he had greeted them, he began to relate one by one the things which God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.	44
NASB	Acts	21	2	And having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail.	44
NASB	Acts	21	20	And when they heard it they began glorifying God; and they said to him, &ldquo;You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the Law;	44
NASB	Acts	21	21	And they have been told about you, that you are teaching all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children nor to walk according to the customs.	44
NASB	Acts	21	22	&ldquo;What, then, is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come.	44
NASB	Acts	21	23	&ldquo;Therefore do this that we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow;	44
NASB	Acts	21	24	Take them and purify yourself along with them, and pay their expenses so that they may shave their heads; and all will know that there is nothing to the things which they have been told about you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the Law.	44
NASB	Acts	21	25	&ldquo;But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we wrote, having decided that they should abstain from meat sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	21	26	Then Paul took the men, and the next day, purifying himself along with them, went into the temple giving notice of the completion of the days of purification, until the sacrifice was offered for each one of them.	44
NASB	Acts	21	27	When the seven days were almost over, the Jews from Asia, upon seeing him in the temple, began to stir up all the crowd and laid hands on him,	44
NASB	Acts	21	28	Crying out, &ldquo;Men of Israel, come to our aid! This is the man who preaches to all men everywhere against our people and the Law and this place; and besides he has even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	21	29	For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.	44
NASB	Acts	21	3	When we came in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left, we kept sailing to Syria and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload its cargo.	44
NASB	Acts	21	30	Then all the city was provoked, and the people rushed together, and taking hold of Paul they dragged him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were shut.	44
NASB	Acts	21	31	While they were seeking to kill him, a report came up to the commander of the Roman cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.	44
NASB	Acts	21	32	At once he took along some soldiers and centurions and ran down to them; and when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.	44
NASB	Acts	21	33	Then the commander came up and took hold of him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains; and he began asking who he was and what he had done.	44
NASB	Acts	21	34	But among the crowd some were shouting one thing and some another, and when he could not find out the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks.	44
NASB	Acts	21	35	When he got to the stairs, he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob;	44
NASB	Acts	21	36	For the multitude of the people kept following them, shouting, &ldquo;Away with him!&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	21	37	As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the commander, &ldquo;May I say something to you?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Do you know Greek?	44
NASB	Acts	21	38	&ldquo;Then you are not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	21	39	But Paul said, &ldquo;I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city; and I beg you, allow me to speak to the people.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	21	4	After looking up the disciples, we stayed there seven days; and they kept telling Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem.	44
NASB	Acts	21	40	When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the stairs, motioned to the people with his hand; and when there was a great hush, he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect, saying,	44
NASB	Acts	21	5	When our days there were ended, we left and started on our journey, while they all, with wives and children, escorted us until we were out of the city. After kneeling down on the beach and praying, we said farewell to one another.	44
NASB	Acts	21	6	Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home again.	44
NASB	Acts	21	7	When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, and after greeting the brethren, we stayed with them for a day.	44
NASB	Acts	21	8	On the next day we left and came to Caesarea, and entering the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we stayed with him.	44
NASB	Acts	21	9	Now this man had four virgin daughters who were prophetesses.	44
NASB	Acts	22	1	&ldquo;Brethren and fathers, hear my defense which I now offer to you.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	22	10	&ldquo;And I said, &lsquo;What shall I do, Lord?&rsquo; And the Lord said to me, &lsquo;Get up and go on into Damascus, and there you will be told of all that has been appointed for you to do.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	22	11	&ldquo;But since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus.	44
NASB	Acts	22	12	&ldquo;A certain Ananias, a man who was devout by the standard of the Law, and well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,	44
NASB	Acts	22	13	Came to me, and standing near said to me, &lsquo;Brother Saul, receive your sight!&rsquo; And at that very time I looked up at him.	44
NASB	Acts	22	14	&ldquo;And he said, &lsquo;The God of our fathers has appointed you to know His will and to see the Righteous One and to hear an utterance from His mouth.	44
NASB	Acts	22	15	&lsquo;For you will be a witness for Him to all men of what you have seen and heard.	44
NASB	Acts	22	16	&lsquo;Now why do you delay? Get up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	22	17	&ldquo;It happened when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, that I fell into a trance,	44
NASB	Acts	22	18	And I saw Him saying to me, &lsquo;Make haste, and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about Me.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	22	19	&ldquo;And I said, &lsquo;Lord, they themselves understand that in one synagogue after another I used to imprison and beat those who believed in You.	44
NASB	Acts	22	2	And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew dialect, they became even more quiet; and he said,	44
NASB	Acts	22	20	&lsquo;And when the blood of Your witness Stephen was being shed, I also was standing by approving, and watching out for the coats of those who were slaying him.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	22	21	&ldquo;And He said to me, &lsquo;Go! For I will send you far away to the Gentiles.&rsquo;&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	22	22	They listened to him up to this statement, and then they raised their voices and said, &ldquo;Away with such a fellow from the earth, for he should not be allowed to live!&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	22	23	And as they were crying out and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air,	44
NASB	Acts	22	24	The commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, stating that he should be examined by scourging so that he might find out the reason why they were shouting against him that way.	44
NASB	Acts	22	25	But when they stretched him out with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, &ldquo;Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned?&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	22	26	When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and told him, saying, &ldquo;What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	22	27	The commander came and said to him, &ldquo;Tell me, are you a Roman?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	22	28	The commander answered, &ldquo;I acquired this citizenship with a large sum of money.&rdquo; And Paul said, &ldquo;But I was actually born a citizen.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	22	29	Therefore those who were about to examine him immediately let go of him; and the commander also was afraid when he found out that he was a Roman, and because he had put him in chains.	44
NASB	Acts	22	3	&ldquo;I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated under Gamaliel, strictly according to the law of our fathers, being zealous for God just as you all are today.	44
NASB	Acts	22	30	But on the next day, wishing to know for certain why he had been accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Council to assemble, and brought Paul down and set him before them.	44
NASB	Acts	22	4	&ldquo;I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and putting both men and women into prisons,	44
NASB	Acts	22	5	As also the high priest and all the Council of the elders can testify. From them I also received letters to the brethren, and started off for Damascus in order to bring even those who were there to Jerusalem as prisoners to be punished.	44
NASB	Acts	22	6	&ldquo;But it happened that as I was on my way, approaching Damascus about noontime, a very bright light suddenly flashed from heaven all around me,	44
NASB	Acts	22	7	And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, &lsquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	22	8	&ldquo;And I answered, &lsquo;Who are You, Lord?&rsquo; And He said to me, &lsquo;I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	22	9	&ldquo;And those who were with me saw the light, to be sure, but did not understand the voice of the One who was speaking to me.	44
NASB	Acts	23	1	Paul, looking intently at the Council, said, &ldquo;Brethren, I have lived my life with a perfectly good conscience before God up to this day.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	23	10	And as a great dissension was developing, the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them and ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force, and bring him into the barracks.	44
NASB	Acts	23	11	But on the night immediately following, the Lord stood at his side and said, &ldquo;Take courage; for as you have solemnly witnessed to My cause at Jerusalem, so you must witness at Rome also.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	23	12	When it was day, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves under an oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.	44
NASB	Acts	23	13	There were more than forty who formed this plot.	44
NASB	Acts	23	14	They came to the chief priests and the elders and said, &ldquo;We have bound ourselves under a solemn oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.	44
NASB	Acts	23	15	&ldquo;Now therefore, you and the Council notify the commander to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case by a more thorough investigation; and we for our part are ready to slay him before he comes near the place.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	23	16	But the son of Paul&rsquo;s sister heard of their ambush, and he came and entered the barracks and told Paul.	44
NASB	Acts	23	17	Paul called one of the centurions to him and said, &ldquo;Lead this young man to the commander, for he has something to report to him.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	23	18	So he took him and led him to the commander and said, &ldquo;Paul the prisoner called me to him and asked me to lead this young man to you since he has something to tell you.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	23	19	The commander took him by the hand and stepping aside, began to inquire of him privately, &ldquo;What is it that you have to report to me?&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	23	2	The high priest Ananias commanded those standing beside him to strike him on the mouth.	44
NASB	Acts	23	20	And he said, &ldquo;The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down tomorrow to the Council, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more thoroughly about him.	44
NASB	Acts	23	21	&ldquo;So do not listen to them, for more than forty of them are lying in wait for him who have bound themselves under a curse not to eat or drink until they slay him; and now they are ready and waiting for the promise from you.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	23	22	So the commander let the young man go, instructing him, &ldquo;Tell no one that you have notified me of these things.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	23	23	And he called to him two of the centurions and said, &ldquo;Get two hundred soldiers ready by the third hour of the night to proceed to Caesarea, with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	23	24	They were also to provide mounts to put Paul on and bring him safely to Felix the governor.	44
NASB	Acts	23	25	And he wrote a letter having this form:	44
NASB	Acts	23	26	&ldquo;Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix, greetings.	44
NASB	Acts	23	27	&ldquo;When this man was arrested by the Jews and was about to be slain by them, I came up to them with the troops and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.	44
NASB	Acts	23	28	&ldquo;And wanting to ascertain the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their Council;	44
NASB	Acts	23	29	And I found him to be accused over questions about their Law, but under no accusation deserving death or imprisonment.	44
NASB	Acts	23	3	Then Paul said to him, &ldquo;God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to try me according to the Law, and in violation of the Law order me to be struck?&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	23	30	&ldquo;When I was informed that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, also instructing his accusers to bring charges against him before you.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	23	31	So the soldiers, in accordance with their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.	44
NASB	Acts	23	32	But the next day, leaving the horsemen to go on with him, they returned to the barracks.	44
NASB	Acts	23	33	When these had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.	44
NASB	Acts	23	34	When he had read it, he asked from what province he was, and when he learned that he was from Cilicia,	44
NASB	Acts	23	35	He said, &ldquo;I will give you a hearing after your accusers arrive also,&rdquo; giving orders for him to be kept in Herod&rsquo;s Praetorium.	44
NASB	Acts	23	4	But the bystanders said, &ldquo;Do you revile God&rsquo;s high priest?&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	23	5	And Paul said, &ldquo;I was not aware, brethren, that he was high priest; for it is written, &lsquo;YOU SHALL NOT SPEAK EVIL OF A RULER OF YOUR PEOPLE.&rsquo;&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	23	6	But perceiving that one group were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, Paul began crying out in the Council, &ldquo;Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; I am on trial for the hope and resurrection of the dead!&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	23	7	As he said this, there occurred a dissension between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.	44
NASB	Acts	23	8	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor an angel, nor a spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.	44
NASB	Acts	23	9	And there occurred a great uproar; and some of the scribes of the Pharisaic party stood up and began to argue heatedly, saying, &ldquo;We find nothing wrong with this man; suppose a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	24	1	After five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders, with an attorney named Tertullus, and they brought charges to the governor against Paul.	44
NASB	Acts	24	10	When the governor had nodded for him to speak, Paul responded: &ldquo;Knowing that for many years you have been a judge to this nation, I cheerfully make my defense,	44
NASB	Acts	24	11	Since you can take note of the fact that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.	44
NASB	Acts	24	12	&ldquo;Neither in the temple, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city itself did they find me carrying on a discussion with anyone or causing a riot.	44
NASB	Acts	24	13	&ldquo;Nor can they prove to you the charges of which they now accuse me.	44
NASB	Acts	24	14	&ldquo;But this I admit to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect I do serve the God of our fathers, believing everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets;	44
NASB	Acts	24	15	Having a hope in God, which these men cherish themselves, that there shall certainly be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.	44
NASB	Acts	24	16	&ldquo;In view of this, I also do my best to maintain always a blameless conscience both before God and before men.	44
NASB	Acts	24	17	&ldquo;Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings;	44
NASB	Acts	24	18	In which they found me occupied in the temple, having been purified, without any crowd or uproar. But there were some Jews from Asia&mdash;	44
NASB	Acts	24	19	Who ought to have been present before you and to make accusation, if they should have anything against me.	44
NASB	Acts	24	2	After Paul had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying to the governor, &ldquo;Since we have through you attained much peace, and since by your providence reforms are being carried out for this nation,	44
NASB	Acts	24	20	&ldquo;Or else let these men themselves tell what misdeed they found when I stood before the Council,	44
NASB	Acts	24	21	Other than for this one statement which I shouted out while standing among them, &lsquo;For the resurrection of the dead I am on trial before you today.&rsquo;&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	24	22	But Felix, having a more exact knowledge about the Way, put them off, saying, &ldquo;When Lysias the commander comes down, I will decide your case.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	24	23	Then he gave orders to the centurion for him to be kept in custody and yet have some freedom, and not to prevent any of his friends from ministering to him.	44
NASB	Acts	24	24	But some days later Felix arrived with Drusilla, his wife who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus.	44
NASB	Acts	24	25	But as he was discussing righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and said, &ldquo;Go away for the present, and when I find time I will summon you.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	24	26	At the same time too, he was hoping that money would be given him by Paul; therefore he also used to send for him quite often and converse with him.	44
NASB	Acts	24	27	But after two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and wishing to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul imprisoned.	44
NASB	Acts	24	3	We acknowledge this in every way and everywhere, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.	44
NASB	Acts	24	4	&ldquo;But, that I may not weary you any further, I beg you to grant us, by your kindness, a brief hearing.	44
NASB	Acts	24	5	&ldquo;For we have found this man a real pest and a fellow who stirs up dissension among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.	44
NASB	Acts	24	6	&ldquo;And he even tried to desecrate the temple; and then we arrested him. [We wanted to judge him according to our own Law.	44
NASB	Acts	24	7	&ldquo;But Lysias the commander came along, and with much violence took him out of our hands,	44
NASB	Acts	24	8	Ordering his accusers to come before you.] By examining him yourself concerning all these matters you will be able to ascertain the things of which we accuse him.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	24	9	The Jews also joined in the attack, asserting that these things were so.	44
NASB	Acts	25	1	Festus then, having arrived in the province, three days later went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.	44
NASB	Acts	25	10	But Paul said, &ldquo;I am standing before Caesar&rsquo;s tribunal, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also very well know.	44
NASB	Acts	25	11	&ldquo;If, then, I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if none of those things is true of which these men accuse me, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	25	12	Then when Festus had conferred with his council, he answered, &ldquo;You have appealed to Caesar, to Caesar you shall go.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	25	13	Now when several days had elapsed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and paid their respects to Festus.	44
NASB	Acts	25	14	While they were spending many days there, Festus laid Paul&rsquo;s case before the king, saying, &ldquo;There is a man who was left as a prisoner by Felix;	44
NASB	Acts	25	15	And when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him.	44
NASB	Acts	25	16	&ldquo;I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to hand over any man before the accused meets his accusers face to face and has an opportunity to make his defense against the charges.	44
NASB	Acts	25	17	&ldquo;So after they had assembled here, I did not delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought before me.	44
NASB	Acts	25	18	&ldquo;When the accusers stood up, they began bringing charges against him not of such crimes as I was expecting,	44
NASB	Acts	25	19	But they simply had some points of disagreement with him about their own religion and about a dead man, Jesus, whom Paul asserted to be alive.	44
NASB	Acts	25	2	And the chief priests and the leading men of the Jews brought charges against Paul, and they were urging him,	44
NASB	Acts	25	20	&ldquo;Being at a loss how to investigate such matters, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there stand trial on these matters.	44
NASB	Acts	25	21	&ldquo;But when Paul appealed to be held in custody for the Emperor&rsquo;s decision, I ordered him to be kept in custody until I send him to Caesar.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	25	22	Then Agrippa said to Festus, &ldquo;I also would like to hear the man myself.&rdquo; &ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you shall hear him.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	25	23	So, on the next day when Agrippa came together with Bernice amid great pomp, and entered the auditorium accompanied by the commanders and the prominent men of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.	44
NASB	Acts	25	24	Festus said, &ldquo;King Agrippa, and all you gentlemen here present with us, you see this man about whom all the people of the Jews appealed to me, both at Jerusalem and here, loudly declaring that he ought not to live any longer.	44
NASB	Acts	25	25	&ldquo;But I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death; and since he himself appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him.	44
NASB	Acts	25	26	&ldquo;Yet I have nothing definite about him to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him before you all and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the investigation has taken place, I may have something to write.	44
NASB	Acts	25	27	&ldquo;For it seems absurd to me in sending a prisoner, not to indicate also the charges against him.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	25	3	Requesting a concession against Paul, that he might have him brought to Jerusalem (at the same time, setting an ambush to kill him on the way).	44
NASB	Acts	25	4	Festus then answered that Paul was being kept in custody at Caesarea and that he himself was about to leave shortly.	44
NASB	Acts	25	5	&ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let the influential men among you go there with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them prosecute him.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	25	6	After he had spent not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea, and on the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought.	44
NASB	Acts	25	7	After Paul arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges against him which they could not prove,	44
NASB	Acts	25	8	While Paul said in his own defense, &ldquo;I have committed no offense either against the Law of the Jews or against the temple or against Caesar.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	25	9	But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, answered Paul and said, &ldquo;Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me on these charges?&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	26	1	Agrippa said to Paul, &ldquo;You are permitted to speak for yourself.&rdquo; Then Paul stretched out his hand and proceeded to make his defense:	44
NASB	Acts	26	10	&ldquo;And this is just what I did in Jerusalem; not only did I lock up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, but also when they were being put to death I cast my vote against them.	44
NASB	Acts	26	11	&ldquo;And as I punished them often in all the synagogues, I tried to force them to blaspheme; and being furiously enraged at them, I kept pursuing them even to foreign cities.	44
NASB	Acts	26	12	&ldquo;While so engaged as I was journeying to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,	44
NASB	Acts	26	13	At midday, O King, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining all around me and those who were journeying with me.	44
NASB	Acts	26	14	&ldquo;And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew dialect, &lsquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	26	15	&ldquo;And I said, &lsquo;Who are You, Lord?&rsquo; And the Lord said, &lsquo;I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.	44
NASB	Acts	26	16	&lsquo;But get up and stand on your feet; for this purpose I have appeared to you, to appoint you a minister and a witness not only to the things which you have seen, but also to the things in which I will appear to you;	44
NASB	Acts	26	17	Rescuing you from the Jewish people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you,	44
NASB	Acts	26	18	To open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the dominion of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	26	19	&ldquo;So, King Agrippa, I did not prove disobedient to the heavenly vision,	44
NASB	Acts	26	2	&ldquo;In regard to all the things of which I am accused by the Jews, I consider myself fortunate, King Agrippa, that I am about to make my defense before you today;	44
NASB	Acts	26	20	But kept declaring both to those of Damascus first, and also at Jerusalem and then throughout all the region of Judea, and even to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds appropriate to repentance.	44
NASB	Acts	26	21	&ldquo;For this reason some Jews seized me in the temple and tried to put me to death.	44
NASB	Acts	26	22	&ldquo;So, having obtained help from God, I stand to this day testifying both to small and great, stating nothing but what the Prophets and Moses said was going to take place;	44
NASB	Acts	26	23	That the Christ was to suffer, and that by reason of His resurrection from the dead He would be the first to proclaim light both to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	26	24	While Paul was saying this in his defense, Festus said in a loud voice, &ldquo;Paul, you are out of your mind! Your great learning is driving you mad.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	26	25	But Paul said, &ldquo;I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I utter words of sober truth.	44
NASB	Acts	26	26	&ldquo;For the king knows about these matters, and I speak to him also with confidence, since I am persuaded that none of these things escape his notice; for this has not been done in a corner.	44
NASB	Acts	26	27	&ldquo;King Agrippa, do you believe the Prophets? I know that you do.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	26	28	Agrippa replied to Paul, &ldquo;In a short time you will persuade me to become a Christian.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	26	29	And Paul said, &ldquo;I would wish to God, that whether in a short or long time, not only you, but also all who hear me this day, might become such as I am, except for these chains.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	26	3	Especially because you are an expert in all customs and questions among the Jews; therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.	44
NASB	Acts	26	30	The king stood up and the governor and Bernice, and those who were sitting with them,	44
NASB	Acts	26	31	And when they had gone aside, they began talking to one another, saying, &ldquo;This man is not doing anything worthy of death or imprisonment.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	26	32	And Agrippa said to Festus, &ldquo;This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	26	4	&ldquo;So then, all Jews know my manner of life from my youth up, which from the beginning was spent among my own nation and at Jerusalem;	44
NASB	Acts	26	5	Since they have known about me for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that I lived as a Pharisee according to the strictest sect of our religion.	44
NASB	Acts	26	6	&ldquo;And now I am standing trial for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers;	44
NASB	Acts	26	7	The promise to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly serve God night and day. And for this hope, O King, I am being accused by Jews.	44
NASB	Acts	26	8	&ldquo;Why is it considered incredible among you people if God does raise the dead?	44
NASB	Acts	26	9	&ldquo;So then, I thought to myself that I had to do many things hostile to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.	44
NASB	Acts	27	1	When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, they proceeded to deliver Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan cohort named Julius.	44
NASB	Acts	27	10	And said to them, &ldquo;Men, I perceive that the voyage will certainly be with damage and great loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	27	11	But the centurion was more persuaded by the pilot and the captain of the ship than by what was being said by Paul.	44
NASB	Acts	27	12	Because the harbor was not suitable for wintering, the majority reached a decision to put out to sea from there, if somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, facing southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there.	44
NASB	Acts	27	13	When a moderate south wind came up, supposing that they had attained their purpose, they weighed anchor and began sailing along Crete, close inshore.	44
NASB	Acts	27	14	But before very long there rushed down from the land a violent wind, called Euraquilo;	44
NASB	Acts	27	15	And when the ship was caught in it and could not face the wind, we gave way to it and let ourselves be driven along.	44
NASB	Acts	27	16	Running under the shelter of a small island called Clauda, we were scarcely able to get the ship&rsquo;s boat under control.	44
NASB	Acts	27	17	After they had hoisted it up, they used supporting cables in undergirding the ship; and fearing that they might run aground on the shallows of Syrtis, they let down the sea anchor and in this way let themselves be driven along.	44
NASB	Acts	27	18	The next day as we were being violently storm-tossed, they began to jettison the cargo;	44
NASB	Acts	27	19	And on the third day they threw the ship&rsquo;s tackle overboard with their own hands.	44
NASB	Acts	27	2	And embarking in an Adramyttian ship, which was about to sail to the regions along the coast of Asia, we put out to sea accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica.	44
NASB	Acts	27	20	Since neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small storm was assailing us, from then on all hope of our being saved was gradually abandoned.	44
NASB	Acts	27	21	When they had gone a long time without food, then Paul stood up in their midst and said, &ldquo;Men, you ought to have followed my advice and not to have set sail from Crete and incurred this damage and loss.	44
NASB	Acts	27	22	&ldquo;Yet now I urge you to keep up your courage, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.	44
NASB	Acts	27	23	&ldquo;For this very night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood before me,	44
NASB	Acts	27	24	Saying, &lsquo;Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar; and behold, God has granted you all those who are sailing with you.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	27	25	&ldquo;Therefore, keep up your courage, men, for I believe God that it will turn out exactly as I have been told.	44
NASB	Acts	27	26	&ldquo;But we must run aground on a certain island.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	27	27	But when the fourteenth night came, as we were being driven about in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors began to surmise that they were approaching some land.	44
NASB	Acts	27	28	They took soundings and found it to be twenty fathoms; and a little farther on they took another sounding and found it to be fifteen fathoms.	44
NASB	Acts	27	29	Fearing that we might run aground somewhere on the rocks, they cast four anchors from the stern and wished for daybreak.	44
NASB	Acts	27	3	The next day we put in at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul with consideration and allowed him to go to his friends and receive care.	44
NASB	Acts	27	30	But as the sailors were trying to escape from the ship and had let down the ship&rsquo;s boat into the sea, on the pretense of intending to lay out anchors from the bow,	44
NASB	Acts	27	31	Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, &ldquo;Unless these men remain in the ship, you yourselves cannot be saved.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	27	32	Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the ship&rsquo;s boat and let it fall away.	44
NASB	Acts	27	33	Until the day was about to dawn, Paul was encouraging them all to take some food, saying, &ldquo;Today is the fourteenth day that you have been constantly watching and going without eating, having taken nothing.	44
NASB	Acts	27	34	&ldquo;Therefore I encourage you to take some food, for this is for your preservation, for not a hair from the head of any of you will perish.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	27	35	Having said this, he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and he broke it and began to eat.	44
NASB	Acts	27	36	All of them were encouraged and they themselves also took food.	44
NASB	Acts	27	37	All of us in the ship were two hundred and seventy-six persons.	44
NASB	Acts	27	38	When they had eaten enough, they began to lighten the ship by throwing out the wheat into the sea.	44
NASB	Acts	27	39	When day came, they could not recognize the land; but they did observe a bay with a beach, and they resolved to drive the ship onto it if they could.	44
NASB	Acts	27	4	From there we put out to sea and sailed under the shelter of Cyprus because the winds were contrary.	44
NASB	Acts	27	40	And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea while at the same time they were loosening the ropes of the rudders; and hoisting the foresail to the wind, they were heading for the beach.	44
NASB	Acts	27	41	But striking a reef where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground; and the prow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern began to be broken up by the force of the waves.	44
NASB	Acts	27	42	The soldiers&rsquo; plan was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would swim away and escape;	44
NASB	Acts	27	43	But the centurion, wanting to bring Paul safely through, kept them from their intention, and commanded that those who could swim should jump overboard first and get to land,	44
NASB	Acts	27	44	And the rest should follow, some on planks, and others on various things from the ship. And so it happened that they all were brought safely to land.	44
NASB	Acts	27	5	When we had sailed through the sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia.	44
NASB	Acts	27	6	There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy, and he put us aboard it.	44
NASB	Acts	27	7	When we had sailed slowly for a good many days, and with difficulty had arrived off Cnidus, since the wind did not permit us to go farther, we sailed under the shelter of Crete, off Salmone;	44
NASB	Acts	27	8	And with difficulty sailing past it we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.	44
NASB	Acts	27	9	When considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, since even the fast was already over, Paul began to admonish them,	44
NASB	Acts	28	1	When they had been brought safely through, then we found out that the island was called Malta.	44
NASB	Acts	28	10	They also honored us with many marks of respect; and when we were setting sail, they supplied us with all we needed.	44
NASB	Acts	28	11	At the end of three months we set sail on an Alexandrian ship which had wintered at the island, and which had the Twin Brothers for its figurehead.	44
NASB	Acts	28	12	After we put in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.	44
NASB	Acts	28	13	From there we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium, and a day later a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli.	44
NASB	Acts	28	14	There we found some brethren, and were invited to stay with them for seven days; and thus we came to Rome.	44
NASB	Acts	28	15	And the brethren, when they heard about us, came from there as far as the Market of Appius and Three Inns to meet us; and when Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.	44
NASB	Acts	28	16	When we entered Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier who was guarding him.	44
NASB	Acts	28	17	After three days Paul called together those who were the leading men of the Jews, and when they came together, he began saying to them, &ldquo;Brethren, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.	44
NASB	Acts	28	18	&ldquo;And when they had examined me, they were willing to release me because there was no ground for putting me to death.	44
NASB	Acts	28	19	&ldquo;But when the Jews objected, I was forced to appeal to Caesar, not that I had any accusation against my nation.	44
NASB	Acts	28	2	The natives showed us extraordinary kindness; for because of the rain that had set in and because of the cold, they kindled a fire and received us all.	44
NASB	Acts	28	20	&ldquo;For this reason, therefore, I requested to see you and to speak with you, for I am wearing this chain for the sake of the hope of Israel.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	28	21	They said to him, &ldquo;We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brethren come here and reported or spoken anything bad about you.	44
NASB	Acts	28	22	&ldquo;But we desire to hear from you what your views are; for concerning this sect, it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	28	23	When they had set a day for Paul, they came to him at his lodging in large numbers; and he was explaining to them by solemnly testifying about the kingdom of God and trying to persuade them concerning Jesus, from both the Law of Moses and from the Prophets, from morning until evening.	44
NASB	Acts	28	24	Some were being persuaded by the things spoken, but others would not believe.	44
NASB	Acts	28	25	And when they did not agree with one another, they began leaving after Paul had spoken one parting word, &ldquo;The Holy Spirit rightly spoke through Isaiah the prophet to your fathers,	44
NASB	Acts	28	26	Saying, &lsquo;GO TO THIS PEOPLE AND SAY, &ldquo;YOU WILL KEEP ON HEARING, BUT WILL NOT UNDERSTAND; AND YOU WILL KEEP ON SEEING, BUT WILL NOT PERCEIVE;	44
NASB	Acts	28	27	FOR THE HEART OF THIS PEOPLE HAS BECOME DULL, AND WITH THEIR EARS THEY SCARCELY HEAR, AND THEY HAVE CLOSED THEIR EYES; OTHERWISE THEY MIGHT SEE WITH THEIR EYES, AND HEAR WITH THEIR EARS, AND UNDERSTAND WITH THEIR HEART AND RETURN, AND I WOULD HEAL THEM.&rsquo;&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	28	28	&ldquo;Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will also listen.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	28	29	[When he had spoken these words, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.]	44
NASB	Acts	28	3	But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand.	44
NASB	Acts	28	30	And he stayed two full years in his own rented quarters and was welcoming all who came to him,	44
NASB	Acts	28	31	Preaching the kingdom of God and teaching concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all openness, unhindered.	44
NASB	Acts	28	4	When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they began saying to one another, &ldquo;Undoubtedly this man is a murderer, and though he has been saved from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	28	5	However he shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm.	44
NASB	Acts	28	6	But they were expecting that he was about to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after they had waited a long time and had seen nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and began to say that he was a god.	44
NASB	Acts	28	7	Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the leading man of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us and entertained us courteously three days.	44
NASB	Acts	28	8	And it happened that the father of Publius was lying in bed afflicted with recurrent fever and dysentery; and Paul went in to see him and after he had prayed, he laid his hands on him and healed him.	44
NASB	Acts	28	9	After this had happened, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases were coming to him and getting cured.	44
NASB	Acts	3	1	Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the ninth hour, the hour of prayer.	44
NASB	Acts	3	10	And they were taking note of him as being the one who used to sit at the Beautiful Gate of the temple to beg alms, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.	44
NASB	Acts	3	11	While he was clinging to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them at the so-called portico of Solomon, full of amazement.	44
NASB	Acts	3	12	But when Peter saw this, he replied to the people, &ldquo;Men of Israel, why are you amazed at this, or why do you gaze at us, as if by our own power or piety we had made him walk?	44
NASB	Acts	3	13	&ldquo;The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His servant Jesus, the one whom you delivered and disowned in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release Him.	44
NASB	Acts	3	14	&ldquo;But you disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,	44
NASB	Acts	3	15	But put to death the Prince of life, the one whom God raised from the dead, a fact to which we are witnesses.	44
NASB	Acts	3	16	&ldquo;And on the basis of faith in His name, it is the name of Jesus which has strengthened this man whom you see and know; and the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all.	44
NASB	Acts	3	17	&ldquo;And now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance, just as your rulers did also.	44
NASB	Acts	3	18	&ldquo;But the things which God announced beforehand by the mouth of all the prophets, that His Christ would suffer, He has thus fulfilled.	44
NASB	Acts	3	19	&ldquo;Therefore repent and return, so that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord;	44
NASB	Acts	3	2	And a man who had been lame from his mother&rsquo;s womb was being carried along, whom they used to set down every day at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, in order to beg alms of those who were entering the temple.	44
NASB	Acts	3	20	And that He may send Jesus, the Christ appointed for you,	44
NASB	Acts	3	21	Whom heaven must receive until the period of restoration of all things about which God spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from ancient time.	44
NASB	Acts	3	22	&ldquo;Moses said, &lsquo;THE LORD GOD WILL RAISE UP FOR YOU A PROPHET LIKE ME FROM YOUR BRETHREN; TO HIM YOU SHALL GIVE HEED to everything He says to you.	44
NASB	Acts	3	23	&lsquo;And it will be that every soul that does not heed that prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	3	24	&ldquo;And likewise, all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and his successors onward, also announced these days.	44
NASB	Acts	3	25	&ldquo;It is you who are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, &lsquo;AND IN YOUR SEED ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH SHALL BE BLESSED.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	3	26	&ldquo;For you first, God raised up His Servant and sent Him to bless you by turning every one of you from your wicked ways.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	3	3	When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he began asking to receive alms.	44
NASB	Acts	3	4	But Peter, along with John, fixed his gaze on him and said, &ldquo;Look at us!&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	3	5	And he began to give them his attention, expecting to receive something from them.	44
NASB	Acts	3	6	But Peter said, &ldquo;I do not possess silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene&mdash;walk!&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	3	7	And seizing him by the right hand, he raised him up; and immediately his feet and his ankles were strengthened.	44
NASB	Acts	3	8	With a leap he stood upright and began to walk; and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God.	44
NASB	Acts	3	9	And all the people saw him walking and praising God;	44
NASB	Acts	4	1	As they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to them,	44
NASB	Acts	4	10	Let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead&mdash;by this name this man stands here before you in good health.	44
NASB	Acts	4	11	&ldquo;He is the STONE WHICH WAS REJECTED by you, THE BUILDERS, but WHICH BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone.	44
NASB	Acts	4	12	&ldquo;And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	4	13	Now as they observed the confidence of Peter and John and understood that they were uneducated and untrained men, they were amazed, and began to recognize them as having been with Jesus.	44
NASB	Acts	4	14	And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say in reply.	44
NASB	Acts	4	15	But when they had ordered them to leave the Council, they began to confer with one another,	44
NASB	Acts	4	16	Saying, &ldquo;What shall we do with these men? For the fact that a noteworthy miracle has taken place through them is apparent to all who live in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.	44
NASB	Acts	4	17	&ldquo;But so that it will not spread any further among the people, let us warn them to speak no longer to any man in this name.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	4	18	And when they had summoned them, they commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.	44
NASB	Acts	4	19	But Peter and John answered and said to them, &ldquo;Whether it is right in the sight of God to give heed to you rather than to God, you be the judge;	44
NASB	Acts	4	2	Being greatly disturbed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.	44
NASB	Acts	4	20	For we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	4	21	When they had threatened them further, they let them go (finding no basis on which to punish them) on account of the people, because they were all glorifying God for what had happened;	44
NASB	Acts	4	22	For the man was more than forty years old on whom this miracle of healing had been performed.	44
NASB	Acts	4	23	When they had been released, they went to their own companions and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.	44
NASB	Acts	4	24	And when they heard this, they lifted their voices to God with one accord and said, &ldquo;O Lord, it is You who MADE THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH AND THE SEA, AND ALL THAT IS IN THEM,	44
NASB	Acts	4	25	Who by the Holy Spirit, through the mouth of our father David Your servant, said, &lsquo;WHY DID THE GENTILES RAGE, AND THE PEOPLES DEVISE FUTILE THINGS?	44
NASB	Acts	4	26	&lsquo;THE KINGS OF THE EARTH TOOK THEIR STAND, AND THE RULERS WERE GATHERED TOGETHER AGAINST THE LORD AND AGAINST HIS CHRIST.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	4	27	&ldquo;For truly in this city there were gathered together against Your holy servant Jesus, whom You anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,	44
NASB	Acts	4	28	To do whatever Your hand and Your purpose predestined to occur.	44
NASB	Acts	4	29	&ldquo;And now, Lord, take note of their threats, and grant that Your bond-servants may speak Your word with all confidence,	44
NASB	Acts	4	3	And they laid hands on them and put them in jail until the next day, for it was already evening.	44
NASB	Acts	4	30	While You extend Your hand to heal, and signs and wonders take place through the name of Your holy servant Jesus.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	4	31	And when they had prayed, the place where they had gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness.	44
NASB	Acts	4	32	And the congregation of those who believed were of one heart and soul; and not one of them claimed that anything belonging to him was his own, but all things were common property to them.	44
NASB	Acts	4	33	And with great power the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and abundant grace was upon them all.	44
NASB	Acts	4	34	For there was not a needy person among them, for all who were owners of land or houses would sell them and bring the proceeds of the sales	44
NASB	Acts	4	35	And lay them at the apostles&rsquo; feet, and they would be distributed to each as any had need.	44
NASB	Acts	4	36	Now Joseph, a Levite of Cyprian birth, who was also called Barnabas by the apostles (which translated means Son of Encouragement),	44
NASB	Acts	4	37	And who owned a tract of land, sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles&rsquo; feet.	44
NASB	Acts	4	4	But many of those who had heard the message believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.	44
NASB	Acts	4	5	On the next day, their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem;	44
NASB	Acts	4	6	And Annas the high priest was there, and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of high-priestly descent.	44
NASB	Acts	4	7	When they had placed them in the center, they began to inquire, &ldquo;By what power, or in what name, have you done this?&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	4	8	Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, &ldquo;Rulers and elders of the people,	44
NASB	Acts	4	9	If we are on trial today for a benefit done to a sick man, as to how this man has been made well,	44
NASB	Acts	5	1	But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property,	44
NASB	Acts	5	10	And immediately she fell at his feet and breathed her last, and the young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.	44
NASB	Acts	5	11	And great fear came over the whole church, and over all who heard of these things.	44
NASB	Acts	5	12	At the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were taking place among the people; and they were all with one accord in Solomon&rsquo;s portico.	44
NASB	Acts	5	13	But none of the rest dared to associate with them; however, the people held them in high esteem.	44
NASB	Acts	5	14	And all the more believers in the Lord, multitudes of men and women, were constantly added to their number,	44
NASB	Acts	5	15	To such an extent that they even carried the sick out into the streets and laid them on cots and pallets, so that when Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on any one of them.	44
NASB	Acts	5	16	Also the people from the cities in the vicinity of Jerusalem were coming together, bringing people who were sick or afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all being healed.	44
NASB	Acts	5	17	But the high priest rose up, along with all his associates (that is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy.	44
NASB	Acts	5	18	They laid hands on the apostles and put them in a public jail.	44
NASB	Acts	5	19	But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the gates of the prison, and taking them out he said,	44
NASB	Acts	5	2	And kept back some of the price for himself, with his wife&rsquo;s full knowledge, and bringing a portion of it, he laid it at the apostles&rsquo; feet.	44
NASB	Acts	5	20	&ldquo;Go, stand and speak to the people in the temple the whole message of this Life.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	5	21	Upon hearing this, they entered into the temple about daybreak and began to teach. Now when the high priest and his associates came, they called the Council together, even all the Senate of the sons of Israel, and sent orders to the prison house for them to be brought.	44
NASB	Acts	5	22	But the officers who came did not find them in the prison; and they returned and reported back,	44
NASB	Acts	5	23	Saying, &ldquo;We found the prison house locked quite securely and the guards standing at the doors; but when we had opened up, we found no one inside.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	5	24	Now when the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests heard these words, they were greatly perplexed about them as to what would come of this.	44
NASB	Acts	5	25	But someone came and reported to them, &ldquo;The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people!&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	5	26	Then the captain went along with the officers and proceeded to bring them back without violence (for they were afraid of the people, that they might be stoned).	44
NASB	Acts	5	27	When they had brought them, they stood them before the Council. The high priest questioned them,	44
NASB	Acts	5	28	Saying, &ldquo;We gave you strict orders not to continue teaching in this name, and yet, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this man&rsquo;s blood upon us.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	5	29	But Peter and the apostles answered, &ldquo;We must obey God rather than men.	44
NASB	Acts	5	3	But Peter said, &ldquo;Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back some of the price of the land?	44
NASB	Acts	5	30	&ldquo;The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you had put to death by hanging Him on a cross.	44
NASB	Acts	5	31	&ldquo;He is the one whom God exalted to His right hand as a Prince and a Savior, to grant repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.	44
NASB	Acts	5	32	&ldquo;And we are witnesses of these things; and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	5	33	But when they heard this, they were cut to the quick and intended to kill them.	44
NASB	Acts	5	34	But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the Law, respected by all the people, stood up in the Council and gave orders to put the men outside for a short time.	44
NASB	Acts	5	35	And he said to them, &ldquo;Men of Israel, take care what you propose to do with these men.	44
NASB	Acts	5	36	&ldquo;For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a group of about four hundred men joined up with him. But he was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing.	44
NASB	Acts	5	37	&ldquo;After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census and drew away some people after him; he too perished, and all those who followed him were scattered.	44
NASB	Acts	5	38	&ldquo;So in the present case, I say to you, stay away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or action is of men, it will be overthrown;	44
NASB	Acts	5	39	But if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them; or else you may even be found fighting against God.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	5	4	&ldquo;While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not under your control? Why is it that you have conceived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	5	40	They took his advice; and after calling the apostles in, they flogged them and ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and then released them.	44
NASB	Acts	5	41	So they went on their way from the presence of the Council, rejoicing that they had been considered worthy to suffer shame for His name.	44
NASB	Acts	5	42	And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they kept right on teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ.	44
NASB	Acts	5	5	And as he heard these words, Ananias fell down and breathed his last; and great fear came over all who heard of it.	44
NASB	Acts	5	6	The young men got up and covered him up, and after carrying him out, they buried him.	44
NASB	Acts	5	7	Now there elapsed an interval of about three hours, and his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.	44
NASB	Acts	5	8	And Peter responded to her, &ldquo;Tell me whether you sold the land for such and such a price?&rdquo; And she said, &ldquo;Yes, that was the price.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	5	9	Then Peter said to her, &ldquo;Why is it that you have agreed together to put the Spirit of the Lord to the test? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out as well.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	6	1	Now at this time while the disciples were increasing in number, a complaint arose on the part of the Hellenistic Jews against the native Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily serving of food.	44
NASB	Acts	6	10	But they were unable to cope with the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking.	44
NASB	Acts	6	11	Then they secretly induced men to say, &ldquo;We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	6	12	And they stirred up the people, the elders and the scribes, and they came up to him and dragged him away and brought him before the Council.	44
NASB	Acts	6	13	They put forward false witnesses who said, &ldquo;This man incessantly speaks against this holy place and the Law;	44
NASB	Acts	6	14	For we have heard him say that this Nazarene, Jesus, will destroy this place and alter the customs which Moses handed down to us.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	6	15	And fixing their gaze on him, all who were sitting in the Council saw his face like the face of an angel.	44
NASB	Acts	6	2	So the twelve summoned the congregation of the disciples and said, &ldquo;It is not desirable for us to neglect the word of God in order to serve tables.	44
NASB	Acts	6	3	&ldquo;Therefore, brethren, select from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may put in charge of this task.	44
NASB	Acts	6	4	&ldquo;But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	6	5	The statement found approval with the whole congregation; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch.	44
NASB	Acts	6	6	And these they brought before the apostles; and after praying, they laid their hands on them.	44
NASB	Acts	6	7	The word of God kept on spreading; and the number of the disciples continued to increase greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were becoming obedient to the faith.	44
NASB	Acts	6	8	And Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people.	44
NASB	Acts	6	9	But some men from what was called the Synagogue of the Freedmen, including both Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and some from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and argued with Stephen.	44
NASB	Acts	7	1	The high priest said, &ldquo;Are these things so?&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	7	10	And rescued him from all his afflictions, and granted him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he made him governor over Egypt and all his household.	44
NASB	Acts	7	11	&ldquo;Now a famine came over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction with it, and our fathers could find no food.	44
NASB	Acts	7	12	&ldquo;But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers there the first time.	44
NASB	Acts	7	13	&ldquo;On the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph&rsquo;s family was disclosed to Pharaoh.	44
NASB	Acts	7	14	&ldquo;Then Joseph sent word and invited Jacob his father and all his relatives to come to him, seventy-five persons in all.	44
NASB	Acts	7	15	&ldquo;And Jacob went down to Egypt and there he and our fathers died.	44
NASB	Acts	7	16	&ldquo;From there they were removed to Shechem and laid in the tomb which Abraham had purchased for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.	44
NASB	Acts	7	17	&ldquo;But as the time of the promise was approaching which God had assured to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt,	44
NASB	Acts	7	18	Until THERE AROSE ANOTHER KING OVER EGYPT WHO KNEW NOTHING ABOUT JOSEPH.	44
NASB	Acts	7	19	&ldquo;It was he who took shrewd advantage of our race and mistreated our fathers so that they would expose their infants and they would not survive.	44
NASB	Acts	7	2	And he said, &ldquo;Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,	44
NASB	Acts	7	20	&ldquo;It was at this time that Moses was born; and he was lovely in the sight of God, and he was nurtured three months in his father&rsquo;s home.	44
NASB	Acts	7	21	&ldquo;And after he had been set outside, Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter took him away and nurtured him as her own son.	44
NASB	Acts	7	22	&ldquo;Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians, and he was a man of power in words and deeds.	44
NASB	Acts	7	23	&ldquo;But when he was approaching the age of forty, it entered his mind to visit his brethren, the sons of Israel.	44
NASB	Acts	7	24	&ldquo;And when he saw one of them being treated unjustly, he defended him and took vengeance for the oppressed by striking down the Egyptian.	44
NASB	Acts	7	25	&ldquo;And he supposed that his brethren understood that God was granting them deliverance through him, but they did not understand.	44
NASB	Acts	7	26	&ldquo;On the following day he appeared to them as they were fighting together, and he tried to reconcile them in peace, saying, &lsquo;Men, you are brethren, why do you injure one another?&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	7	27	&ldquo;But the one who was injuring his neighbor pushed him away, saying, &lsquo;WHO MADE YOU A RULER AND JUDGE OVER US?	44
NASB	Acts	7	28	&lsquo;YOU DO NOT MEAN TO KILL ME AS YOU KILLED THE EGYPTIAN YESTERDAY, DO YOU?&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	7	29	&ldquo;At this remark, MOSES FLED AND BECAME AN ALIEN IN THE LAND OF MIDIAN, where he became the father of two sons.	44
NASB	Acts	7	3	And said to him, &lsquo;LEAVE YOUR COUNTRY AND YOUR RELATIVES, AND COME INTO THE LAND THAT I WILL SHOW YOU.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	7	30	&ldquo;After forty years had passed, AN ANGEL APPEARED TO HIM IN THE WILDERNESS OF MOUNT Sinai, IN THE FLAME OF A BURNING THORN BUSH.	44
NASB	Acts	7	31	&ldquo;When Moses saw it, he marveled at the sight; and as he approached to look more closely, there came the voice of the Lord:	44
NASB	Acts	7	32	&lsquo;I AM THE GOD OF YOUR FATHERS, THE GOD OF ABRAHAM AND ISAAC AND JACOB.&rsquo; Moses shook with fear and would not venture to look.	44
NASB	Acts	7	33	&ldquo;BUT THE LORD SAID TO HIM, &lsquo;TAKE OFF THE SANDALS FROM YOUR FEET, FOR THE PLACE ON WHICH YOU ARE STANDING IS HOLY GROUND.	44
NASB	Acts	7	34	&lsquo;I HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN THE OPPRESSION OF MY PEOPLE IN EGYPT AND HAVE HEARD THEIR GROANS, AND I HAVE COME DOWN TO RESCUE THEM; COME NOW, AND I WILL SEND YOU TO EGYPT.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	7	35	&ldquo;This Moses whom they disowned, saying, &lsquo;WHO MADE YOU A RULER AND A JUDGE?&rsquo; is the one whom God sent to be both a ruler and a deliverer with the help of the angel who appeared to him in the thorn bush.	44
NASB	Acts	7	36	&ldquo;This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years.	44
NASB	Acts	7	37	&ldquo;This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel, &lsquo;GOD WILL RAISE UP FOR YOU A PROPHET LIKE ME FROM YOUR BRETHREN.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	7	38	&ldquo;This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness together with the angel who was speaking to him on Mount Sinai, and who was with our fathers; and he received living oracles to pass on to you.	44
NASB	Acts	7	39	&ldquo;Our fathers were unwilling to be obedient to him, but repudiated him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt,	44
NASB	Acts	7	4	&ldquo;Then he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. From there, after his father died, God had him move to this country in which you are now living.	44
NASB	Acts	7	40	SAYING TO AARON, &lsquo;MAKE FOR US GODS WHO WILL GO BEFORE US; FOR THIS MOSES WHO LED US OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT&mdash;WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	7	41	&ldquo;At that time they made a calf and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their hands.	44
NASB	Acts	7	42	&ldquo;But God turned away and delivered them up to serve the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, &lsquo;IT WAS NOT TO ME THAT YOU OFFERED VICTIMS AND SACRIFICES FORTY YEARS IN THE WILDERNESS, WAS IT, O HOUSE OF ISRAEL?	44
NASB	Acts	7	43	&lsquo;YOU ALSO TOOK ALONG THE TABERNACLE OF MOLOCH AND THE STAR OF THE GOD ROMPHA, THE IMAGES WHICH YOU MADE TO WORSHIP. I ALSO WILL REMOVE YOU BEYOND BABYLON.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	7	44	&ldquo;Our fathers had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness, just as He who spoke to Moses directed him to make it according to the pattern which he had seen.	44
NASB	Acts	7	45	&ldquo;And having received it in their turn, our fathers brought it in with Joshua upon dispossessing the nations whom God drove out before our fathers, until the time of David.	44
NASB	Acts	7	46	&ldquo;David found favor in God&rsquo;s sight, and asked that he might find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.	44
NASB	Acts	7	47	&ldquo;But it was Solomon who built a house for Him.	44
NASB	Acts	7	48	&ldquo;However, the Most High does not dwell in houses made by human hands; as the prophet says:	44
NASB	Acts	7	49	&lsquo;HEAVEN IS MY THRONE, AND EARTH IS THE FOOTSTOOL OF MY FEET; WHAT KIND OF HOUSE WILL YOU BUILD FOR ME?&rsquo; says the Lord, &lsquo;OR WHAT PLACE IS THERE FOR MY REPOSE?	44
NASB	Acts	7	5	&ldquo;But He gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot of ground, and yet, even when he had no child, He promised that HE WOULD GIVE IT TO HIM AS A POSSESSION, AND TO HIS DESCENDANTS AFTER HIM.	44
NASB	Acts	7	50	&lsquo;WAS IT NOT MY HAND WHICH MADE ALL THESE THINGS?&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	7	51	&ldquo;You men who are stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears are always resisting the Holy Spirit; you are doing just as your fathers did.	44
NASB	Acts	7	52	&ldquo;Which one of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? They killed those who had previously announced the coming of the Righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become;	44
NASB	Acts	7	53	You who received the law as ordained by angels, and yet did not keep it.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	7	54	Now when they heard this, they were cut to the quick, and they began gnashing their teeth at him.	44
NASB	Acts	7	55	But being full of the Holy Spirit, he gazed intently into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God;	44
NASB	Acts	7	56	And he said, &ldquo;Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	7	57	But they cried out with a loud voice, and covered their ears and rushed at him with one impulse.	44
NASB	Acts	7	58	When they had driven him out of the city, they began stoning him; and the witnesses laid aside their robes at the feet of a young man named Saul.	44
NASB	Acts	7	59	They went on stoning Stephen as he called on the Lord and said, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	7	6	&ldquo;But God spoke to this effect, that his DESCENDANTS WOULD BE ALIENS IN A FOREIGN LAND, AND THAT THEY WOULD BE ENSLAVED AND MISTREATED FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS.	44
NASB	Acts	7	60	Then falling on his knees, he cried out with a loud voice, &ldquo;Lord, do not hold this sin against them!&rdquo; Having said this, he fell asleep.	44
NASB	Acts	7	7	&rdquo; &lsquo;AND WHATEVER NATION TO WHICH THEY WILL BE IN BONDAGE I MYSELF WILL JUDGE,&rsquo; said God, &lsquo;AND AFTER THAT THEY WILL COME OUT AND SERVE ME IN THIS PLACE.&rsquo;	44
NASB	Acts	7	8	&ldquo;And He gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.	44
NASB	Acts	7	9	&ldquo;The patriarchs became jealous of Joseph and sold him into Egypt. Yet God was with him,	44
NASB	Acts	8	1	Saul was in hearty agreement with putting him to death. And on that day a great persecution began against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.	44
NASB	Acts	8	10	And they all, from smallest to greatest, were giving attention to him, saying, &ldquo;This man is what is called the Great Power of God.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	8	11	And they were giving him attention because he had for a long time astonished them with his magic arts.	44
NASB	Acts	8	12	But when they believed Philip preaching the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were being baptized, men and women alike.	44
NASB	Acts	8	13	Even Simon himself believed; and after being baptized, he continued on with Philip, and as he observed signs and great miracles taking place, he was constantly amazed.	44
NASB	Acts	8	14	Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent them Peter and John,	44
NASB	Acts	8	15	Who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.	44
NASB	Acts	8	16	For He had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.	44
NASB	Acts	8	17	Then they began laying their hands on them, and they were receiving the Holy Spirit.	44
NASB	Acts	8	18	Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was bestowed through the laying on of the apostles&rsquo; hands, he offered them money,	44
NASB	Acts	8	19	Saying, &ldquo;Give this authority to me as well, so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	8	2	Some devout men buried Stephen, and made loud lamentation over him.	44
NASB	Acts	8	20	But Peter said to him, &ldquo;May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!	44
NASB	Acts	8	21	&ldquo;You have no part or portion in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.	44
NASB	Acts	8	22	&ldquo;Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray the Lord that, if possible, the intention of your heart may be forgiven you.	44
NASB	Acts	8	23	&ldquo;For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	8	24	But Simon answered and said, &ldquo;Pray to the Lord for me yourselves, so that nothing of what you have said may come upon me.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	8	25	So, when they had solemnly testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they started back to Jerusalem, and were preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.	44
NASB	Acts	8	26	But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip saying, &ldquo;Get up and go south to the road that descends from Jerusalem to Gaza.&rdquo; (This is a desert road.)	44
NASB	Acts	8	27	So he got up and went; and there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure; and he had come to Jerusalem to worship,	44
NASB	Acts	8	28	And he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.	44
NASB	Acts	8	29	Then the Spirit said to Philip, &ldquo;Go up and join this chariot.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	8	3	But Saul began ravaging the church, entering house after house, and dragging off men and women, he would put them in prison.	44
NASB	Acts	8	30	Philip ran up and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, &ldquo;Do you understand what you are reading?&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	8	31	And he said, &ldquo;Well, how could I, unless someone guides me?&rdquo; And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.	44
NASB	Acts	8	32	Now the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this: &ldquo;HE WAS LED AS A SHEEP TO SLAUGHTER; AND AS A LAMB BEFORE ITS SHEARER IS SILENT, SO HE DOES NOT OPEN HIS MOUTH.	44
NASB	Acts	8	33	&ldquo;IN HUMILIATION HIS JUDGMENT WAS TAKEN AWAY; WHO WILL RELATE HIS GENERATION? FOR HIS LIFE IS REMOVED FROM THE EARTH.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	8	34	The eunuch answered Philip and said, &ldquo;Please tell me, of whom does the prophet say this? Of himself or of someone else?&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	8	35	Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture he preached Jesus to him.	44
NASB	Acts	8	36	As they went along the road they came to some water; and the eunuch said, &ldquo;Look! Water! What prevents me from being baptized?&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	8	37	[And Philip said, &ldquo;If you believe with all your heart, you may.&rdquo; And he answered and said, &ldquo;I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.&rdquo;]	44
NASB	Acts	8	38	And he ordered the chariot to stop; and they both went down into the water, Philip as well as the eunuch, and he baptized him.	44
NASB	Acts	8	39	When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; and the eunuch no longer saw him, but went on his way rejoicing.	44
NASB	Acts	8	4	Therefore, those who had been scattered went about preaching the word.	44
NASB	Acts	8	40	But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he kept preaching the gospel to all the cities until he came to Caesarea.	44
NASB	Acts	8	5	Philip went down to the city of Samaria and began proclaiming Christ to them.	44
NASB	Acts	8	6	The crowds with one accord were giving attention to what was said by Philip, as they heard and saw the signs which he was performing.	44
NASB	Acts	8	7	For in the case of many who had unclean spirits, they were coming out of them shouting with a loud voice; and many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed.	44
NASB	Acts	8	8	So there was much rejoicing in that city.	44
NASB	Acts	8	9	Now there was a man named Simon, who formerly was practicing magic in the city and astonishing the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great;	44
NASB	Acts	9	1	Now Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,	44
NASB	Acts	9	10	Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, &ldquo;Ananias.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Here I am, Lord.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	9	11	And the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Get up and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying,	44
NASB	Acts	9	12	And he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him, so that he might regain his sight.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	9	13	But Ananias answered, &ldquo;Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much harm he did to Your saints at Jerusalem;	44
NASB	Acts	9	14	And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on Your name.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	9	15	But the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Go, for he is a chosen instrument of Mine, to bear My name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel;	44
NASB	Acts	9	16	For I will show him how much he must suffer for My name&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	9	17	So Ananias departed and entered the house, and after laying his hands on him said, &ldquo;Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road by which you were coming, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	9	18	And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he regained his sight, and he got up and was baptized;	44
NASB	Acts	9	19	And he took food and was strengthened. Now for several days he was with the disciples who were at Damascus,	44
NASB	Acts	9	2	And asked for letters from him to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.	44
NASB	Acts	9	20	And immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, &ldquo;He is the Son of God.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	9	21	All those hearing him continued to be amazed, and were saying, &ldquo;Is this not he who in Jerusalem destroyed those who called on this name, and who had come here for the purpose of bringing them bound before the chief priests?&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	9	22	But Saul kept increasing in strength and confounding the Jews who lived at Damascus by proving that this Jesus is the Christ.	44
NASB	Acts	9	23	When many days had elapsed, the Jews plotted together to do away with him,	44
NASB	Acts	9	24	But their plot became known to Saul. They were also watching the gates day and night so that they might put him to death;	44
NASB	Acts	9	25	But his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a large basket.	44
NASB	Acts	9	26	When he came to Jerusalem, he was trying to associate with the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.	44
NASB	Acts	9	27	But Barnabas took hold of him and brought him to the apostles and described to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had talked to him, and how at Damascus he had spoken out boldly in the name of Jesus.	44
NASB	Acts	9	28	And he was with them, moving about freely in Jerusalem, speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord.	44
NASB	Acts	9	29	And he was talking and arguing with the Hellenistic Jews; but they were attempting to put him to death.	44
NASB	Acts	9	3	As he was traveling, it happened that he was approaching Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him;	44
NASB	Acts	9	30	But when the brethren learned of it, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.	44
NASB	Acts	9	31	So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria enjoyed peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it continued to increase.	44
NASB	Acts	9	32	Now as Peter was traveling through all those regions, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda.	44
NASB	Acts	9	33	There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden eight years, for he was paralyzed.	44
NASB	Acts	9	34	Peter said to him, &ldquo;Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; get up and make your bed.&rdquo; Immediately he got up.	44
NASB	Acts	9	35	And all who lived at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.	44
NASB	Acts	9	36	Now in Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which translated in Greek is called Dorcas); this woman was abounding with deeds of kindness and charity which she continually did.	44
NASB	Acts	9	37	And it happened at that time that she fell sick and died; and when they had washed her body, they laid it in an upper room.	44
NASB	Acts	9	38	Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him, imploring him, &ldquo;Do not delay in coming to us.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	9	39	So Peter arose and went with them. When he arrived, they brought him into the upper room; and all the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing all the tunics and garments that Dorcas used to make while she was with them.	44
NASB	Acts	9	4	And he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	9	40	But Peter sent them all out and knelt down and prayed, and turning to the body, he said, &ldquo;Tabitha, arise.&rdquo; And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.	44
NASB	Acts	9	41	And he gave her his hand and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.	44
NASB	Acts	9	42	It became known all over Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.	44
NASB	Acts	9	43	And Peter stayed many days in Joppa with a tanner named Simon.	44
NASB	Acts	9	5	And he said, &ldquo;Who are You, Lord?&rdquo; And He said, &ldquo;I am Jesus whom you are persecuting,	44
NASB	Acts	9	6	But get up and enter the city, and it will be told you what you must do.&rdquo;	44
NASB	Acts	9	7	The men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one.	44
NASB	Acts	9	8	Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing; and leading him by the hand, they brought him into Damascus.	44
NASB	Acts	9	9	And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.	44
NASB	Colossians	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,	51
NASB	Colossians	1	10	So that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;	51
NASB	Colossians	1	11	Strengthened with all power, according to His glorious might, for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience; joyously	51
NASB	Colossians	1	12	Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in Light.	51
NASB	Colossians	1	13	For He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son,	51
NASB	Colossians	1	14	In whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.	51
NASB	Colossians	1	15	He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.	51
NASB	Colossians	1	16	For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities&mdash;all things have been created through Him and for Him.	51
NASB	Colossians	1	17	He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.	51
NASB	Colossians	1	18	He is also head of the body, the church; and He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He Himself will come to have first place in everything.	51
NASB	Colossians	1	19	For it was the Father&rsquo;s good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in Him,	51
NASB	Colossians	1	2	To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father.	51
NASB	Colossians	1	20	And through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross; through Him, I say, whether things on earth or things in heaven.	51
NASB	Colossians	1	21	And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind, engaged in evil deeds,	51
NASB	Colossians	1	22	Yet He has now reconciled you in His fleshly body through death, in order to present you before Him holy and blameless and beyond reproach&mdash;	51
NASB	Colossians	1	23	If indeed you continue in the faith firmly established and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you have heard, which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, was made a minister.	51
NASB	Colossians	1	24	Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of His body, which is the church, in filling up what is lacking in Christ&rsquo;s afflictions.	51
NASB	Colossians	1	25	Of this church I was made a minister according to the stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit, so that I might fully carry out the preaching of the word of God,	51
NASB	Colossians	1	26	That is, the mystery which has been hidden from the past ages and generations, but has now been manifested to His saints,	51
NASB	Colossians	1	27	To whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.	51
NASB	Colossians	1	28	We proclaim Him, admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom, so that we may present every man complete in Christ.	51
NASB	Colossians	1	29	For this purpose also I labor, striving according to His power, which mightily works within me.	51
NASB	Colossians	1	3	We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,	51
NASB	Colossians	1	4	Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love which you have for all the saints;	51
NASB	Colossians	1	5	Because of the hope laid up for you in heaven, of which you previously heard in the word of truth, the gospel	51
NASB	Colossians	1	6	Which has come to you, just as in all the world also it is constantly bearing fruit and increasing, even as it has been doing in you also since the day you heard of it and understood the grace of God in truth;	51
NASB	Colossians	1	7	Just as you learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow bond-servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf,	51
NASB	Colossians	1	8	And he also informed us of your love in the Spirit.	51
NASB	Colossians	1	9	For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,	51
NASB	Colossians	2	1	For I want you to know how great a struggle I have on your behalf and for those who are at Laodicea, and for all those who have not personally seen my face,	51
NASB	Colossians	2	10	And in Him you have been made complete, and He is the head over all rule and authority;	51
NASB	Colossians	2	11	And in Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ;	51
NASB	Colossians	2	12	Having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised up with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead.	51
NASB	Colossians	2	13	When you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our transgressions,	51
NASB	Colossians	2	14	Having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross.	51
NASB	Colossians	2	15	When He had disarmed the rulers and authorities, He made a public display of them, having triumphed over them through Him.	51
NASB	Colossians	2	16	Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day&mdash;	51
NASB	Colossians	2	17	Things which are a mere shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.	51
NASB	Colossians	2	18	Let no one keep defrauding you of your prize by delighting in self-abasement and the worship of the angels, taking his stand on visions he has seen, inflated without cause by his fleshly mind,	51
NASB	Colossians	2	19	And not holding fast to the head, from whom the entire body, being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments, grows with a growth which is from God.	51
NASB	Colossians	2	2	That their hearts may be encouraged, having been knit together in love, and attaining to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding, resulting in a true knowledge of God&rsquo;s mystery, that is, Christ Himself,	51
NASB	Colossians	2	20	If you have died with Christ to the elementary principles of the world, why, as if you were living in the world, do you submit yourself to decrees, such as,	51
NASB	Colossians	2	21	&ldquo;Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!&rdquo;	51
NASB	Colossians	2	22	(which all refer to things destined to perish with use)&mdash;in accordance with the commandments and teachings of men?	51
NASB	Colossians	2	23	These are matters which have, to be sure, the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body, but are of no value against fleshly indulgence.	51
NASB	Colossians	2	3	In whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.	51
NASB	Colossians	2	4	I say this so that no one will delude you with persuasive argument.	51
NASB	Colossians	2	5	For even though I am absent in body, nevertheless I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good discipline and the stability of your faith in Christ.	51
NASB	Colossians	2	6	Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him,	51
NASB	Colossians	2	7	Having been firmly rooted and now being built up in Him and established in your faith, just as you were instructed, and overflowing with gratitude.	51
NASB	Colossians	2	8	See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ.	51
NASB	Colossians	2	9	For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form,	51
NASB	Colossians	3	1	Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.	51
NASB	Colossians	3	10	And have put on the new self who is being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the One who created him&mdash;	51
NASB	Colossians	3	11	A renewal in which there is no distinction between Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and freeman, but Christ is all, and in all.	51
NASB	Colossians	3	12	So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience;	51
NASB	Colossians	3	13	Bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so also should you.	51
NASB	Colossians	3	14	Beyond all these things put on love, which is the perfect bond of unity.	51
NASB	Colossians	3	15	Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body; and be thankful.	51
NASB	Colossians	3	16	Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you, with all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God.	51
NASB	Colossians	3	17	Whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father.	51
NASB	Colossians	3	18	Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.	51
NASB	Colossians	3	19	Husbands, love your wives and do not be embittered against them.	51
NASB	Colossians	3	2	Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth.	51
NASB	Colossians	3	20	Children, be obedient to your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing to the Lord.	51
NASB	Colossians	3	21	Fathers, do not exasperate your children, so that they will not lose heart.	51
NASB	Colossians	3	22	Slaves, in all things obey those who are your masters on earth, not with external service, as those who merely please men, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.	51
NASB	Colossians	3	23	Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather than for men,	51
NASB	Colossians	3	24	Knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance. It is the Lord Christ whom you serve.	51
NASB	Colossians	3	25	For he who does wrong will receive the consequences of the wrong which he has done, and that without partiality.	51
NASB	Colossians	3	3	For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.	51
NASB	Colossians	3	4	When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.	51
NASB	Colossians	3	5	Therefore consider the members of your earthly body as dead to immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed, which amounts to idolatry.	51
NASB	Colossians	3	6	For it is because of these things that the wrath of God will come upon the sons of disobedience,	51
NASB	Colossians	3	7	And in them you also once walked, when you were living in them.	51
NASB	Colossians	3	8	But now you also, put them all aside: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and abusive speech from your mouth.	51
NASB	Colossians	3	9	Do not lie to one another, since you laid aside the old self with its evil practices,	51
NASB	Colossians	4	1	Masters, grant to your slaves justice and fairness, knowing that you too have a Master in heaven.	51
NASB	Colossians	4	10	Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends you his greetings; and also Barnabas&rsquo;s cousin Mark (about whom you received instructions; if he comes to you, welcome him);	51
NASB	Colossians	4	11	And also Jesus who is called Justus; these are the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are from the circumcision, and they have proved to be an encouragement to me.	51
NASB	Colossians	4	12	Epaphras, who is one of your number, a bondslave of Jesus Christ, sends you his greetings, always laboring earnestly for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God.	51
NASB	Colossians	4	13	For I testify for him that he has a deep concern for you and for those who are in Laodicea and Hierapolis.	51
NASB	Colossians	4	14	Luke, the beloved physician, sends you his greetings, and also Demas.	51
NASB	Colossians	4	15	Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea and also Nympha and the church that is in her house.	51
NASB	Colossians	4	16	When this letter is read among you, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and you, for your part read my letter that is coming from Laodicea.	51
NASB	Colossians	4	17	Say to Archippus, &ldquo;Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you may fulfill it.&rdquo;	51
NASB	Colossians	4	18	I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my imprisonment. Grace be with you.	51
NASB	Colossians	4	2	Devote yourselves to prayer, keeping alert in it with an attitude of thanksgiving;	51
NASB	Colossians	4	3	Praying at the same time for us as well, that God will open up to us a door for the word, so that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ, for which I have also been imprisoned;	51
NASB	Colossians	4	4	That I may make it clear in the way I ought to speak.	51
NASB	Colossians	4	5	Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunity.	51
NASB	Colossians	4	6	Let your speech always be with grace, as though seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should respond to each person.	51
NASB	Colossians	4	7	As to all my affairs, Tychicus, our beloved brother and faithful servant and fellow bond-servant in the Lord, will bring you information.	51
NASB	Colossians	4	8	For I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts;	51
NASB	Colossians	4	9	And with him Onesimus, our faithful and beloved brother, who is one of your number. They will inform you about the whole situation here.	51
NASB	Ephesians	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints who are at Ephesus and who are faithful in Christ Jesus:	49
NASB	Ephesians	1	10	With a view to an administration suitable to the fullness of the times, that is, the summing up of all things in Christ, things in the heavens and things on the earth. In Him	49
NASB	Ephesians	1	11	Also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His will,	49
NASB	Ephesians	1	12	To the end that we who were the first to hope in Christ would be to the praise of His glory.	49
NASB	Ephesians	1	13	In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation&mdash;having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise,	49
NASB	Ephesians	1	14	Who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of God&rsquo;s own possession, to the praise of His glory.	49
NASB	Ephesians	1	15	For this reason I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which exists among you and your love for all the saints,	49
NASB	Ephesians	1	16	Do not cease giving thanks for you, while making mention of you in my prayers;	49
NASB	Ephesians	1	17	That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him.	49
NASB	Ephesians	1	18	I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,	49
NASB	Ephesians	1	19	And what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe. These are in accordance with the working of the strength of His might	49
NASB	Ephesians	1	2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	49
NASB	Ephesians	1	20	Which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places,	49
NASB	Ephesians	1	21	Far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come.	49
NASB	Ephesians	1	22	And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him as head over all things to the church,	49
NASB	Ephesians	1	23	Which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.	49
NASB	Ephesians	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,	49
NASB	Ephesians	1	4	Just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love	49
NASB	Ephesians	1	5	He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,	49
NASB	Ephesians	1	6	To the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.	49
NASB	Ephesians	1	7	In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace	49
NASB	Ephesians	1	8	Which He lavished on us. In all wisdom and insight	49
NASB	Ephesians	1	9	He made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His kind intention which He purposed in Him	49
NASB	Ephesians	2	1	And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,	49
NASB	Ephesians	2	10	For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.	49
NASB	Ephesians	2	11	Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called &ldquo;Uncircumcision&rdquo; by the so-called &ldquo;Circumcision,&rdquo; which is performed in the flesh by human hands&mdash;	49
NASB	Ephesians	2	12	Remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.	49
NASB	Ephesians	2	13	But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.	49
NASB	Ephesians	2	14	For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall,	49
NASB	Ephesians	2	15	By abolishing in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace,	49
NASB	Ephesians	2	16	And might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity.	49
NASB	Ephesians	2	17	AND HE CAME AND PREACHED PEACE TO YOU WHO WERE FAR AWAY, AND PEACE TO THOSE WHO WERE NEAR;	49
NASB	Ephesians	2	18	For through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.	49
NASB	Ephesians	2	19	So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God&rsquo;s household,	49
NASB	Ephesians	2	2	In which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.	49
NASB	Ephesians	2	20	Having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner stone,	49
NASB	Ephesians	2	21	In whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord,	49
NASB	Ephesians	2	22	In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit.	49
NASB	Ephesians	2	3	Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.	49
NASB	Ephesians	2	4	But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,	49
NASB	Ephesians	2	5	Even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),	49
NASB	Ephesians	2	6	And raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,	49
NASB	Ephesians	2	7	So that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.	49
NASB	Ephesians	2	8	For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;	49
NASB	Ephesians	2	9	Not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.	49
NASB	Ephesians	3	1	For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles&mdash;	49
NASB	Ephesians	3	10	So that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places.	49
NASB	Ephesians	3	11	This was in accordance with the eternal purpose which He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,	49
NASB	Ephesians	3	12	In whom we have boldness and confident access through faith in Him.	49
NASB	Ephesians	3	13	Therefore I ask you not to lose heart at my tribulations on your behalf, for they are your glory.	49
NASB	Ephesians	3	14	For this reason I bow my knees before the Father,	49
NASB	Ephesians	3	15	From whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name,	49
NASB	Ephesians	3	16	That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man,	49
NASB	Ephesians	3	17	So that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and grounded in love,	49
NASB	Ephesians	3	18	May be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,	49
NASB	Ephesians	3	19	And to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.	49
NASB	Ephesians	3	2	If indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God&rsquo;s grace which was given to me for you;	49
NASB	Ephesians	3	20	Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us,	49
NASB	Ephesians	3	21	To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.	49
NASB	Ephesians	3	3	That by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief.	49
NASB	Ephesians	3	4	By referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,	49
NASB	Ephesians	3	5	Which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;	49
NASB	Ephesians	3	6	To be specific, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,	49
NASB	Ephesians	3	7	Of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of God&rsquo;s grace which was given to me according to the working of His power.	49
NASB	Ephesians	3	8	To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ,	49
NASB	Ephesians	3	9	And to bring to light what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things;	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	1	Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called,	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	10	He who descended is Himself also He who ascended far above all the heavens, so that He might fill all things.)	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	11	And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers,	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	12	For the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ;	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	13	Until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	14	As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming;	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	15	But speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ,	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	16	From whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	17	So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	18	Being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart;	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	19	And they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	2	With all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love,	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	20	But you did not learn Christ in this way,	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	21	If indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus,	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	22	That, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit,	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	23	And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	24	And put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	25	Therefore, laying aside falsehood, SPEAK TRUTH EACH ONE of you WITH HIS NEIGHBOR, for we are members of one another.	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	26	BE ANGRY, AND yet DO NOT SIN; do not let the sun go down on your anger,	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	27	And do not give the devil an opportunity.	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	28	He who steals must steal no longer; but rather he must labor, performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have something to share with one who has need.	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	29	Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment, so that it will give grace to those who hear.	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	3	Being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	30	Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	31	Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	32	Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	4	There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling;	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	5	One Lord, one faith, one baptism,	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	6	One God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	7	But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ&rsquo;s gift.	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	8	Therefore it says, &ldquo;WHEN HE ASCENDED ON HIGH, HE LED CAPTIVE A HOST OF CAPTIVES, AND HE GAVE GIFTS TO MEN.&rdquo;	49
NASB	Ephesians	4	9	(Now this expression, &ldquo;He ascended,&rdquo; what does it mean except that He also had descended into the lower parts of the earth?	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	1	Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children;	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	10	Trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	11	Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them;	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	12	For it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret.	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	13	But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light.	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	14	For this reason it says, &ldquo;Awake, sleeper, And arise from the dead, And Christ will shine on you.&rdquo;	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	15	Therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise,	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	16	Making the most of your time, because the days are evil.	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	17	So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	18	And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	19	Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	2	And walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	20	Always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	21	And be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	22	Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	23	For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body.	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	24	But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything.	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	25	Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her,	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	26	So that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	27	That He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless.	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	28	So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself;	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	29	For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church,	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	3	But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints;	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	30	Because we are members of His body.	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	31	FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND SHALL BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH.	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	32	This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	33	Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own wife even as himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects her husband.	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	4	And there must be no filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks.	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	5	For this you know with certainty, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	6	Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	7	Therefore do not be partakers with them;	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	8	For you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; walk as children of Light	49
NASB	Ephesians	5	9	(for the fruit of the Light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth),	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	1	Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	10	Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might.	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	11	Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	12	For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	13	Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm.	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	14	Stand firm therefore, HAVING GIRDED YOUR LOINS WITH TRUTH, and HAVING PUT ON THE BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS,	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	15	And having shod YOUR FEET WITH THE PREPARATION OF THE GOSPEL OF PEACE;	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	16	In addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	17	And take THE HELMET OF SALVATION, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	18	With all prayer and petition pray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints,	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	19	And pray on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel,	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	2	HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER (which is the first commandment with a promise),	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	20	For which I am an ambassador in chains; that in proclaiming it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	21	But that you also may know about my circumstances, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make everything known to you.	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	22	I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know about us, and that he may comfort your hearts.	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	23	Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	24	Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love.	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	3	SO THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH YOU, AND THAT YOU MAY LIVE LONG ON THE EARTH.	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	4	Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	5	Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ;	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	6	Not by way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	7	With good will render service, as to the Lord, and not to men,	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	8	Knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free.	49
NASB	Ephesians	6	9	And masters, do the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with Him.	49
NASB	Galatians	1	1	Paul, an apostle (not sent from men nor through the agency of man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead),	48
NASB	Galatians	1	10	For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a bond-servant of Christ.	48
NASB	Galatians	1	11	For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.	48
NASB	Galatians	1	12	For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.	48
NASB	Galatians	1	13	For you have heard of my former manner of life in Judaism, how I used to persecute the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it;	48
NASB	Galatians	1	14	And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my countrymen, being more extremely zealous for my ancestral traditions.	48
NASB	Galatians	1	15	But when God, who had set me apart even from my mother&rsquo;s womb and called me through His grace, was pleased	48
NASB	Galatians	1	16	To reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,	48
NASB	Galatians	1	17	Nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went away to Arabia, and returned once more to Damascus.	48
NASB	Galatians	1	18	Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and stayed with him fifteen days.	48
NASB	Galatians	1	19	But I did not see any other of the apostles except James, the Lord&rsquo;s brother.	48
NASB	Galatians	1	2	And all the brethren who are with me, To the churches of Galatia:	48
NASB	Galatians	1	20	(Now in what I am writing to you, I assure you before God that I am not lying.)	48
NASB	Galatians	1	21	Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.	48
NASB	Galatians	1	22	I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea which were in Christ;	48
NASB	Galatians	1	23	But only, they kept hearing, &ldquo;He who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith which he once tried to destroy.&rdquo;	48
NASB	Galatians	1	24	And they were glorifying God because of me.	48
NASB	Galatians	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,	48
NASB	Galatians	1	4	Who gave Himself for our sins so that He might rescue us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,	48
NASB	Galatians	1	5	To whom be the glory forevermore. Amen.	48
NASB	Galatians	1	6	I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel;	48
NASB	Galatians	1	7	Which is really not another; only there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.	48
NASB	Galatians	1	8	But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed!	48
NASB	Galatians	1	9	As we have said before, so I say again now, if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, he is to be accursed!	48
NASB	Galatians	2	1	Then after an interval of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also.	48
NASB	Galatians	2	10	They only asked us to remember the poor&mdash;the very thing I also was eager to do.	48
NASB	Galatians	2	11	But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned.	48
NASB	Galatians	2	12	For prior to the coming of certain men from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to withdraw and hold himself aloof, fearing the party of the circumcision.	48
NASB	Galatians	2	13	The rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy, with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy.	48
NASB	Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of all, &ldquo;If you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?	48
NASB	Galatians	2	15	&ldquo;We are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles;	48
NASB	Galatians	2	16	Nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified.	48
NASB	Galatians	2	17	&ldquo;But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves have also been found sinners, is Christ then a minister of sin? May it never be!	48
NASB	Galatians	2	18	&ldquo;For if I rebuild what I have once destroyed, I prove myself to be a transgressor.	48
NASB	Galatians	2	19	&ldquo;For through the Law I died to the Law, so that I might live to God.	48
NASB	Galatians	2	2	It was because of a revelation that I went up; and I submitted to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but I did so in private to those who were of reputation, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain.	48
NASB	Galatians	2	20	&ldquo;I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.	48
NASB	Galatians	2	21	&ldquo;I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ died needlessly.&rdquo;	48
NASB	Galatians	2	3	But not even Titus, who was with me, though he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.	48
NASB	Galatians	2	4	But it was because of the false brethren secretly brought in, who had sneaked in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, in order to bring us into bondage.	48
NASB	Galatians	2	5	But we did not yield in subjection to them for even an hour, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you.	48
NASB	Galatians	2	6	But from those who were of high reputation (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)&mdash;well, those who were of reputation contributed nothing to me.	48
NASB	Galatians	2	7	But on the contrary, seeing that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been to the circumcised	48
NASB	Galatians	2	8	(for He who effectually worked for Peter in his apostleship to the circumcised effectually worked for me also to the Gentiles),	48
NASB	Galatians	2	9	And recognizing the grace that had been given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, so that we might go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.	48
NASB	Galatians	3	1	You foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified?	48
NASB	Galatians	3	10	For as many as are of the works of the Law are under a curse; for it is written, &ldquo;CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO DOES NOT ABIDE BY ALL THINGS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW, TO PERFORM THEM.&rdquo;	48
NASB	Galatians	3	11	Now that no one is justified by the Law before God is evident; for, &ldquo;THE RIGHTEOUS MAN SHALL LIVE BY FAITH.&rdquo;	48
NASB	Galatians	3	12	However, the Law is not of faith; on the contrary, &ldquo;HE WHO PRACTICES THEM SHALL LIVE BY THEM.&rdquo;	48
NASB	Galatians	3	13	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us&mdash;for it is written, &ldquo;CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO HANGS ON A TREE&rdquo;&mdash;	48
NASB	Galatians	3	14	In order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we would receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.	48
NASB	Galatians	3	15	Brethren, I speak in terms of human relations: even though it is only a man&rsquo;s covenant, yet when it has been ratified, no one sets it aside or adds conditions to it.	48
NASB	Galatians	3	16	Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, &ldquo;And to seeds,&rdquo; as referring to many, but rather to one, &ldquo;And to your seed,&rdquo; that is, Christ.	48
NASB	Galatians	3	17	What I am saying is this: the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise.	48
NASB	Galatians	3	18	For if the inheritance is based on law, it is no longer based on a promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by means of a promise.	48
NASB	Galatians	3	19	Why the Law then? It was added because of transgressions, having been ordained through angels by the agency of a mediator, until the seed would come to whom the promise had been made.	48
NASB	Galatians	3	2	This is the only thing I want to find out from you: did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?	48
NASB	Galatians	3	20	Now a mediator is not for one party only; whereas God is only one.	48
NASB	Galatians	3	21	Is the Law then contrary to the promises of God? May it never be! For if a law had been given which was able to impart life, then righteousness would indeed have been based on law.	48
NASB	Galatians	3	22	But the Scripture has shut up everyone under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.	48
NASB	Galatians	3	23	But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.	48
NASB	Galatians	3	24	Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, so that we may be justified by faith.	48
NASB	Galatians	3	25	But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.	48
NASB	Galatians	3	26	For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.	48
NASB	Galatians	3	27	For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.	48
NASB	Galatians	3	28	There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.	48
NASB	Galatians	3	29	And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham&rsquo;s descendants, heirs according to promise.	48
NASB	Galatians	3	3	Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?	48
NASB	Galatians	3	4	Did you suffer so many things in vain&mdash;if indeed it was in vain?	48
NASB	Galatians	3	5	So then, does He who provides you with the Spirit and works miracles among you, do it by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?	48
NASB	Galatians	3	6	Even so Abraham BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS RECKONED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.	48
NASB	Galatians	3	7	Therefore, be sure that it is those who are of faith who are sons of Abraham.	48
NASB	Galatians	3	8	The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, &ldquo;ALL THE NATIONS WILL BE BLESSED IN YOU.&rdquo;	48
NASB	Galatians	3	9	So then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the believer.	48
NASB	Galatians	4	1	Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he does not differ at all from a slave although he is owner of everything,	48
NASB	Galatians	4	10	You observe days and months and seasons and years.	48
NASB	Galatians	4	11	I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored over you in vain.	48
NASB	Galatians	4	12	I beg of you, brethren, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You have done me no wrong;	48
NASB	Galatians	4	13	But you know that it was because of a bodily illness that I preached the gospel to you the first time;	48
NASB	Galatians	4	14	And that which was a trial to you in my bodily condition you did not despise or loathe, but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus Himself.	48
NASB	Galatians	4	15	Where then is that sense of blessing you had? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.	48
NASB	Galatians	4	16	So have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?	48
NASB	Galatians	4	17	They eagerly seek you, not commendably, but they wish to shut you out so that you will seek them.	48
NASB	Galatians	4	18	But it is good always to be eagerly sought in a commendable manner, and not only when I am present with you.	48
NASB	Galatians	4	19	My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is formed in you&mdash;	48
NASB	Galatians	4	2	But he is under guardians and managers until the date set by the father.	48
NASB	Galatians	4	20	But I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.	48
NASB	Galatians	4	21	Tell me, you who want to be under law, do you not listen to the law?	48
NASB	Galatians	4	22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the bondwoman and one by the free woman.	48
NASB	Galatians	4	23	But the son by the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and the son by the free woman through the promise.	48
NASB	Galatians	4	24	This is allegorically speaking, for these women are two covenants: one proceeding from Mount Sinai bearing children who are to be slaves; she is Hagar.	48
NASB	Galatians	4	25	Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.	48
NASB	Galatians	4	26	But the Jerusalem above is free; she is our mother.	48
NASB	Galatians	4	27	For it is written, &ldquo;REJOICE, BARREN WOMAN WHO DOES NOT BEAR; BREAK FORTH AND SHOUT, YOU WHO ARE NOT IN LABOR; FOR MORE NUMEROUS ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE DESOLATE THAN OF THE ONE WHO HAS A HUSBAND.&rdquo;	48
NASB	Galatians	4	28	And you brethren, like Isaac, are children of promise.	48
NASB	Galatians	4	29	But as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now also.	48
NASB	Galatians	4	3	So also we, while we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental things of the world.	48
NASB	Galatians	4	30	But what does the Scripture say? &ldquo;CAST OUT THE BONDWOMAN AND HER SON, FOR THE SON OF THE BONDWOMAN SHALL NOT BE AN HEIR WITH THE SON OF THE FREE WOMAN.&rdquo;	48
NASB	Galatians	4	31	So then, brethren, we are not children of a bondwoman, but of the free woman.	48
NASB	Galatians	4	4	But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the Law,	48
NASB	Galatians	4	5	So that He might redeem those who were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.	48
NASB	Galatians	4	6	Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, &ldquo;Abba! Father!&rdquo;	48
NASB	Galatians	4	7	Therefore you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.	48
NASB	Galatians	4	8	However at that time, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those which by nature are no gods.	48
NASB	Galatians	4	9	But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless elemental things, to which you desire to be enslaved all over again?	48
NASB	Galatians	5	1	It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.	48
NASB	Galatians	5	10	I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will adopt no other view; but the one who is disturbing you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.	48
NASB	Galatians	5	11	But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished.	48
NASB	Galatians	5	12	I wish that those who are troubling you would even mutilate themselves.	48
NASB	Galatians	5	13	For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.	48
NASB	Galatians	5	14	For the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, &ldquo;YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.&rdquo;	48
NASB	Galatians	5	15	But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another.	48
NASB	Galatians	5	16	But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh.	48
NASB	Galatians	5	17	For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please.	48
NASB	Galatians	5	18	But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law.	48
NASB	Galatians	5	19	Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality,	48
NASB	Galatians	5	2	Behold I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you.	48
NASB	Galatians	5	20	Idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions,	48
NASB	Galatians	5	21	Envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.	48
NASB	Galatians	5	22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,	48
NASB	Galatians	5	23	Gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.	48
NASB	Galatians	5	24	Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.	48
NASB	Galatians	5	25	If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.	48
NASB	Galatians	5	26	Let us not become boastful, challenging one another, envying one another.	48
NASB	Galatians	5	3	And I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law.	48
NASB	Galatians	5	4	You have been severed from Christ, you who are seeking to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.	48
NASB	Galatians	5	5	For we through the Spirit, by faith, are waiting for the hope of righteousness.	48
NASB	Galatians	5	6	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but faith working through love.	48
NASB	Galatians	5	7	You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth?	48
NASB	Galatians	5	8	This persuasion did not come from Him who calls you.	48
NASB	Galatians	5	9	A little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough.	48
NASB	Galatians	6	1	Brethren, even if anyone is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; each one looking to yourself, so that you too will not be tempted.	48
NASB	Galatians	6	10	So then, while we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, and especially to those who are of the household of the faith.	48
NASB	Galatians	6	11	See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand.	48
NASB	Galatians	6	12	Those who desire to make a good showing in the flesh try to compel you to be circumcised, simply so that they will not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.	48
NASB	Galatians	6	13	For those who are circumcised do not even keep the Law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh.	48
NASB	Galatians	6	14	But may it never be that I would boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.	48
NASB	Galatians	6	15	For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.	48
NASB	Galatians	6	16	And those who will walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.	48
NASB	Galatians	6	17	From now on let no one cause trouble for me, for I bear on my body the brand-marks of Jesus.	48
NASB	Galatians	6	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.	48
NASB	Galatians	6	2	Bear one another&rsquo;s burdens, and thereby fulfill the law of Christ.	48
NASB	Galatians	6	3	For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.	48
NASB	Galatians	6	4	But each one must examine his own work, and then he will have reason for boasting in regard to himself alone, and not in regard to another.	48
NASB	Galatians	6	5	For each one will bear his own load.	48
NASB	Galatians	6	6	The one who is taught the word is to share all good things with the one who teaches him.	48
NASB	Galatians	6	7	Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap.	48
NASB	Galatians	6	8	For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.	48
NASB	Galatians	6	9	Let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we will reap if we do not grow weary.	48
NASB	Hebrews	1	1	God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways,	58
NASB	Hebrews	1	10	And, &ldquo;YOU, LORD, IN THE BEGINNING LAID THE FOUNDATION OF THE EARTH, AND THE HEAVENS ARE THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS;	58
NASB	Hebrews	1	11	THEY WILL PERISH, BUT YOU REMAIN; AND THEY ALL WILL BECOME OLD LIKE A GARMENT,	58
NASB	Hebrews	1	12	AND LIKE A MANTLE YOU WILL ROLL THEM UP; LIKE A GARMENT THEY WILL ALSO BE CHANGED. BUT YOU ARE THE SAME, AND YOUR YEARS WILL NOT COME TO AN END.&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	1	13	But to which of the angels has He ever said, &ldquo;SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET&rdquo;?	58
NASB	Hebrews	1	14	Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to render service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?	58
NASB	Hebrews	1	2	In these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world.	58
NASB	Hebrews	1	3	And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power. When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,	58
NASB	Hebrews	1	4	Having become as much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they.	58
NASB	Hebrews	1	5	For to which of the angels did He ever say, &ldquo;YOU ARE MY SON, TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU&rdquo;? And again, &ldquo;I WILL BE A FATHER TO HIM AND HE SHALL BE A SON TO ME&rdquo;?	58
NASB	Hebrews	1	6	And when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says, &ldquo;AND LET ALL THE ANGELS OF GOD WORSHIP HIM.&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	1	7	And of the angels He says, &ldquo;WHO MAKES HIS ANGELS WINDS, AND HIS MINISTERS A FLAME OF FIRE.&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	1	8	But of the Son He says, &ldquo;YOUR THRONE, O GOD, IS FOREVER AND EVER, AND THE RIGHTEOUS SCEPTER IS THE SCEPTER OF HIS KINGDOM.	58
NASB	Hebrews	1	9	&ldquo;YOU HAVE LOVED RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HATED LAWLESSNESS; THEREFORE GOD, YOUR GOD, HAS ANOINTED YOU WITH THE OIL OF GLADNESS ABOVE YOUR COMPANIONS.&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	1	For the Law, since it has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the very form of things, can never, by the same sacrifices which they offer continually year by year, make perfect those who draw near.	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	10	By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	11	Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins;	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	12	But He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD,	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	13	Waiting from that time onward UNTIL HIS ENEMIES BE MADE A FOOTSTOOL FOR HIS FEET.	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	14	For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	15	And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after saying,	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	16	&ldquo;THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THEM AFTER THOSE DAYS, SAYS THE LORD: I WILL PUT MY LAWS UPON THEIR HEART, AND ON THEIR MIND I WILL WRITE THEM,&rdquo; He then says,	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	17	&ldquo;AND THEIR SINS AND THEIR LAWLESS DEEDS I WILL REMEMBER NO MORE.&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	18	Now where there is forgiveness of these things, there is no longer any offering for sin.	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	19	Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus,	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	2	Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have had consciousness of sins?	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	20	By a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh,	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	21	And since we have a great priest over the house of God,	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	22	Let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	23	Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful;	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	24	And let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds,	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	25	Not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	26	For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	27	But a terrifying expectation of judgment and THE FURY OF A FIRE WHICH WILL CONSUME THE ADVERSARIES.	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	28	Anyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	29	How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	3	But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year by year.	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	30	For we know Him who said, &ldquo;VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY.&rdquo; And again, &ldquo;THE LORD WILL JUDGE HIS PEOPLE.&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	31	It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	32	But remember the former days, when, after being enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings,	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	33	Partly by being made a public spectacle through reproaches and tribulations, and partly by becoming sharers with those who were so treated.	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	34	For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and a lasting one.	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	35	Therefore, do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	36	For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised.	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	37	FOR YET IN A VERY LITTLE WHILE, HE WHO IS COMING WILL COME, AND WILL NOT DELAY.	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	38	BUT MY RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL LIVE BY FAITH; AND IF HE SHRINKS BACK, MY SOUL HAS NO PLEASURE IN HIM.	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	39	But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the preserving of the soul.	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	4	For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	5	Therefore, when He comes into the world, He says, &ldquo;SACRIFICE AND OFFERING YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED, BUT A BODY YOU HAVE PREPARED FOR ME;	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	6	IN WHOLE BURNT OFFERINGS AND sacrifices FOR SIN YOU HAVE TAKEN NO PLEASURE.	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	7	&ldquo;THEN I SAID, &lsquo;BEHOLD, I HAVE COME (IN THE SCROLL OF THE BOOK IT IS WRITTEN OF ME) TO DO YOUR WILL, O GOD.&rsquo;&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	8	After saying above, &ldquo;SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS AND WHOLE BURNT OFFERINGS AND sacrifices FOR SIN YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED, NOR HAVE YOU TAKEN PLEASURE in them&rdquo; (which are offered according to the Law),	58
NASB	Hebrews	10	9	Then He said, &ldquo;BEHOLD, I HAVE COME TO DO YOUR WILL.&rdquo; He takes away the first in order to establish the second.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	1	Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	10	For he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	11	By faith even Sarah herself received ability to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	12	Therefore there was born even of one man, and him as good as dead at that, as many descendants AS THE STARS OF HEAVEN IN NUMBER, AND INNUMERABLE AS THE SAND WHICH IS BY THE SEASHORE.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	13	All these died in faith, without receiving the promises, but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	14	For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	15	And indeed if they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	16	But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He has prepared a city for them.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	17	By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was offering up his only begotten son;	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	18	It was he to whom it was said, &ldquo;IN ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS SHALL BE CALLED.&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	19	He considered that God is able to raise people even from the dead, from which he also received him back as a type.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	2	For by it the men of old gained approval.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	20	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even regarding things to come.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	21	By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	22	By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	23	By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king&rsquo;s edict.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	24	By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter,	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	25	Choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin,	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	26	Considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	27	By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing Him who is unseen.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	28	By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that he who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	29	By faith they passed through the Red Sea as though they were passing through dry land; and the Egyptians, when they attempted it, were drowned.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	3	By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	31	By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with those who were disobedient, after she had welcomed the spies in peace.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	32	And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets,	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	33	Who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions,	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	34	Quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	35	Women received back their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured, not accepting their release, so that they might obtain a better resurrection;	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	36	And others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also chains and imprisonment.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	37	They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	38	(men of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	39	And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did not receive what was promised,	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	4	By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	40	Because God had provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	5	By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death; AND HE WAS NOT FOUND BECAUSE GOD TOOK HIM UP; for he obtained the witness that before his being taken up he was pleasing to God.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	6	And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	7	By faith Noah, being warned by God about things not yet seen, in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	8	By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going.	58
NASB	Hebrews	11	9	By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise;	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	1	Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	10	For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but He disciplines us for our good, so that we may share His holiness.	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	11	All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	12	Therefore, strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble,	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	13	And make straight paths for your feet, so that the limb which is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather be healed.	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	14	Pursue peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no one will see the Lord.	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	15	See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God; that no root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, and by it many be defiled;	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	16	That there be no immoral or godless person like Esau, who sold his own birthright for a single meal.	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	17	For you know that even afterwards, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought for it with tears.	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	18	For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched and to a blazing fire, and to darkness and gloom and whirlwind,	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	19	And to the blast of a trumpet and the sound of words which sound was such that those who heard begged that no further word be spoken to them.	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	2	Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	20	For they could not bear the command, &ldquo;IF EVEN A BEAST TOUCHES THE MOUNTAIN, IT WILL BE STONED.&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	21	And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, &ldquo;I AM FULL OF FEAR and trembling.&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	22	But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels,	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	23	To the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	24	And to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks better than the blood of Abel.	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	25	See to it that you do not refuse Him who is speaking. For if those did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less will we escape who turn away from Him who warns from heaven.	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	26	And His voice shook the earth then, but now He has promised, saying, &ldquo;YET ONCE MORE I WILL SHAKE NOT ONLY THE EARTH, BUT ALSO THE HEAVEN.&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	27	This expression, &ldquo;Yet once more,&rdquo; denotes the removing of those things which can be shaken, as of created things, so that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	28	Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude, by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe;	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	29	For our God is a consuming fire.	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	3	For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	4	You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin;	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	5	And you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as sons, &ldquo;MY SON, DO NOT REGARD LIGHTLY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE LORD, NOR FAINT WHEN YOU ARE REPROVED BY HIM;	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	6	FOR THOSE WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES, AND HE SCOURGES EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVES.&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	7	It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	8	But if you are without discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.	58
NASB	Hebrews	12	9	Furthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us, and we respected them; shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of spirits, and live?	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	1	Let love of the brethren continue.	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	10	We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat.	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	11	For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside the camp.	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	12	Therefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate.	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	13	So, let us go out to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	14	For here we do not have a lasting city, but we are seeking the city which is to come.	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	15	Through Him then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that give thanks to His name.	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	16	And do not neglect doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	17	Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	18	Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a good conscience, desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things.	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	19	And I urge you all the more to do this, so that I may be restored to you the sooner.	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	2	Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it.	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	20	Now the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the eternal covenant, even Jesus our Lord,	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	21	Equip you in every good thing to do His will, working in us that which is pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	22	But I urge you, brethren, bear with this word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly.	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	23	Take notice that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom, if he comes soon, I will see you.	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	24	Greet all of your leaders and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you.	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	25	Grace be with you all.	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	3	Remember the prisoners, as though in prison with them, and those who are ill-treated, since you yourselves also are in the body.	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	4	Marriage is to be held in honor among all, and the marriage bed is to be undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	5	Make sure that your character is free from the love of money, being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, &ldquo;I WILL NEVER DESERT YOU, NOR WILL I EVER FORSAKE YOU,&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	6	So that we confidently say, &ldquo;THE LORD IS MY HELPER, I WILL NOT BE AFRAID. WHAT WILL MAN DO TO ME?&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	7	Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to you; and considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith.	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	8	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.	58
NASB	Hebrews	13	9	Do not be carried away by varied and strange teachings; for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods, through which those who were so occupied were not benefited.	58
NASB	Hebrews	2	1	For this reason we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away from it.	58
NASB	Hebrews	2	10	For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the author of their salvation through sufferings.	58
NASB	Hebrews	2	11	For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one Father; for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren,	58
NASB	Hebrews	2	12	Saying, &ldquo;I WILL PROCLAIM YOUR NAME TO MY BRETHREN, IN THE MIDST OF THE CONGREGATION I WILL SING YOUR PRAISE.&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	2	13	And again, &ldquo;I WILL PUT MY TRUST IN HIM.&rdquo; And again, &ldquo;BEHOLD, I AND THE CHILDREN WHOM GOD HAS GIVEN ME.&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	2	14	Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death He might render powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,	58
NASB	Hebrews	2	15	And might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.	58
NASB	Hebrews	2	16	For assuredly He does not give help to angels, but He gives help to the descendant of Abraham.	58
NASB	Hebrews	2	17	Therefore, He had to be made like His brethren in all things, so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.	58
NASB	Hebrews	2	18	For since He Himself was tempted in that which He has suffered, He is able to come to the aid of those who are tempted.	58
NASB	Hebrews	2	2	For if the word spoken through angels proved unalterable, and every transgression and disobedience received a just penalty,	58
NASB	Hebrews	2	3	How will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? After it was at the first spoken through the Lord, it was confirmed to us by those who heard,	58
NASB	Hebrews	2	4	God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders and by various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit according to His own will.	58
NASB	Hebrews	2	5	For He did not subject to angels the world to come, concerning which we are speaking.	58
NASB	Hebrews	2	6	But one has testified somewhere, saying, &ldquo;WHAT IS MAN, THAT YOU REMEMBER HIM? OR THE SON OF MAN, THAT YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HIM?	58
NASB	Hebrews	2	7	&ldquo;YOU HAVE MADE HIM FOR A LITTLE WHILE LOWER THAN THE ANGELS; YOU HAVE CROWNED HIM WITH GLORY AND HONOR, AND HAVE APPOINTED HIM OVER THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS;	58
NASB	Hebrews	2	8	YOU HAVE PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIS FEET.&rdquo; For in subjecting all things to him, He left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him.	58
NASB	Hebrews	2	9	But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than the angels, namely, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone.	58
NASB	Hebrews	3	1	Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession;	58
NASB	Hebrews	3	10	&ldquo;THEREFORE I WAS ANGRY WITH THIS GENERATION, AND SAID, &lsquo;THEY ALWAYS GO ASTRAY IN THEIR HEART, AND THEY DID NOT KNOW MY WAYS&rsquo;;	58
NASB	Hebrews	3	11	AS I SWORE IN MY WRATH, &lsquo;THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST.&rsquo;&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	3	12	Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God.	58
NASB	Hebrews	3	13	But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is still called &ldquo;Today,&rdquo; so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.	58
NASB	Hebrews	3	14	For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end,	58
NASB	Hebrews	3	15	While it is said, &ldquo;TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE, DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS, AS WHEN THEY PROVOKED ME.&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	3	16	For who provoked Him when they had heard? Indeed, did not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses?	58
NASB	Hebrews	3	17	And with whom was He angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?	58
NASB	Hebrews	3	18	And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who were disobedient?	58
NASB	Hebrews	3	19	So we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.	58
NASB	Hebrews	3	2	He was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was in all His house.	58
NASB	Hebrews	3	3	For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by just so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the house.	58
NASB	Hebrews	3	4	For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.	58
NASB	Hebrews	3	5	Now Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later;	58
NASB	Hebrews	3	6	But Christ was faithful as a Son over His house&mdash;whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until the end.	58
NASB	Hebrews	3	7	Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says, &ldquo;TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE,	58
NASB	Hebrews	3	8	DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS AS WHEN THEY PROVOKED ME, AS IN THE DAY OF TRIAL IN THE WILDERNESS,	58
NASB	Hebrews	3	9	WHERE YOUR FATHERS TRIED Me BY TESTING Me, AND SAW MY WORKS FOR FORTY YEARS.	58
NASB	Hebrews	4	1	Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of entering His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it.	58
NASB	Hebrews	4	10	For the one who has entered His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His.	58
NASB	Hebrews	4	11	Therefore let us be diligent to enter that rest, so that no one will fall, through following the same example of disobedience.	58
NASB	Hebrews	4	12	For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.	58
NASB	Hebrews	4	13	And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.	58
NASB	Hebrews	4	14	Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.	58
NASB	Hebrews	4	15	For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.	58
NASB	Hebrews	4	16	Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.	58
NASB	Hebrews	4	2	For indeed we have had good news preached to us, just as they also; but the word they heard did not profit them, because it was not united by faith in those who heard.	58
NASB	Hebrews	4	3	For we who have believed enter that rest, just as He has said, &ldquo;AS I SWORE IN MY WRATH, THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST,&rdquo; although His works were finished from the foundation of the world.	58
NASB	Hebrews	4	4	For He has said somewhere concerning the seventh day: &ldquo;AND GOD RESTED ON THE SEVENTH DAY FROM ALL HIS WORKS&rdquo;;	58
NASB	Hebrews	4	5	And again in this passage, &ldquo;THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST.&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	4	6	Therefore, since it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly had good news preached to them failed to enter because of disobedience,	58
NASB	Hebrews	4	7	He again fixes a certain day, &ldquo;Today,&rdquo; saying through David after so long a time just as has been said before, &ldquo;TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE, DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS.&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	4	8	For if Joshua had given them rest, He would not have spoken of another day after that.	58
NASB	Hebrews	4	9	So there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.	58
NASB	Hebrews	5	1	For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of men in things pertaining to God, in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins;	58
NASB	Hebrews	5	10	Being designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.	58
NASB	Hebrews	5	11	Concerning him we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.	58
NASB	Hebrews	5	12	For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food.	58
NASB	Hebrews	5	13	For everyone who partakes only of milk is not accustomed to the word of righteousness, for he is an infant.	58
NASB	Hebrews	5	14	But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil.	58
NASB	Hebrews	5	2	He can deal gently with the ignorant and misguided, since he himself also is beset with weakness;	58
NASB	Hebrews	5	3	And because of it he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins, as for the people, so also for himself.	58
NASB	Hebrews	5	4	And no one takes the honor to himself, but receives it when he is called by God, even as Aaron was.	58
NASB	Hebrews	5	5	So also Christ did not glorify Himself so as to become a high priest, but He who said to Him, &ldquo;YOU ARE MY SON, TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU&rdquo;;	58
NASB	Hebrews	5	6	Just as He says also in another passage, &ldquo;YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK.&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	5	7	In the days of His flesh, He offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crying and tears to the One able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His piety.	58
NASB	Hebrews	5	8	Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from the things which He suffered.	58
NASB	Hebrews	5	9	And having been made perfect, He became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation,	58
NASB	Hebrews	6	1	Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,	58
NASB	Hebrews	6	10	For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward His name, in having ministered and in still ministering to the saints.	58
NASB	Hebrews	6	11	And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end,	58
NASB	Hebrews	6	12	So that you will not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.	58
NASB	Hebrews	6	13	For when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself,	58
NASB	Hebrews	6	14	Saying, &ldquo;I WILL SURELY BLESS YOU AND I WILL SURELY MULTIPLY YOU.&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	6	15	And so, having patiently waited, he obtained the promise.	58
NASB	Hebrews	6	16	For men swear by one greater than themselves, and with them an oath given as confirmation is an end of every dispute.	58
NASB	Hebrews	6	17	In the same way God, desiring even more to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose, interposed with an oath,	58
NASB	Hebrews	6	18	So that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us.	58
NASB	Hebrews	6	19	This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and one which enters within the veil,	58
NASB	Hebrews	6	2	Of instruction about washings and laying on of hands, and the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment.	58
NASB	Hebrews	6	20	Where Jesus has entered as a forerunner for us, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.	58
NASB	Hebrews	6	3	And this we will do, if God permits.	58
NASB	Hebrews	6	4	For in the case of those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit,	58
NASB	Hebrews	6	5	And have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,	58
NASB	Hebrews	6	6	And then have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and put Him to open shame.	58
NASB	Hebrews	6	7	For ground that drinks the rain which often falls on it and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is also tilled, receives a blessing from God;	58
NASB	Hebrews	6	8	But if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to being cursed, and it ends up being burned.	58
NASB	Hebrews	6	9	But, beloved, we are convinced of better things concerning you, and things that accompany salvation, though we are speaking in this way.	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	1	For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	10	For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	11	Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated according to the order of Aaron?	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	12	For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of law also.	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	13	For the one concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	14	For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	15	And this is clearer still, if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek,	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	16	Who has become such not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life.	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	17	For it is attested of Him, &ldquo;YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK.&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	18	For, on the one hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	19	(for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the other hand there is a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	2	To whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all the spoils, was first of all, by the translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace.	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	20	And inasmuch as it was not without an oath	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	21	(for they indeed became priests without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him, &ldquo;THE LORD HAS SWORN AND WILL NOT CHANGE HIS MIND, &lsquo;YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER&rsquo;&rdquo;);	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	22	So much the more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	23	The former priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing,	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	24	But Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently.	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	25	Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	26	For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens;	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	27	Who does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people, because this He did once for all when He offered up Himself.	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	28	For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son, made perfect forever.	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	3	Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	4	Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils.	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	5	And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest&rsquo;s office have commandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, although these are descended from Abraham.	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	6	But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	7	But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	8	In this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case one receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives on.	58
NASB	Hebrews	7	9	And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes,	58
NASB	Hebrews	8	1	Now the main point in what has been said is this: we have such a high priest, who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,	58
NASB	Hebrews	8	10	&ldquo;FOR THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AFTER THOSE DAYS, SAYS THE LORD: I WILL PUT MY LAWS INTO THEIR MINDS, AND I WILL WRITE THEM ON THEIR HEARTS. AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE.	58
NASB	Hebrews	8	11	&ldquo;AND THEY SHALL NOT TEACH EVERYONE HIS FELLOW CITIZEN, AND EVERYONE HIS BROTHER, SAYING, &lsquo;KNOW THE LORD,&rsquo; FOR ALL WILL KNOW ME, FROM THE LEAST TO THE GREATEST OF THEM.	58
NASB	Hebrews	8	12	&ldquo;FOR I WILL BE MERCIFUL TO THEIR INIQUITIES, AND I WILL REMEMBER THEIR SINS NO MORE.&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	8	13	When He said, &ldquo;A new covenant,&rdquo; He has made the first obsolete. But whatever is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to disappear.	58
NASB	Hebrews	8	2	A minister in the sanctuary and in the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.	58
NASB	Hebrews	8	3	For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.	58
NASB	Hebrews	8	4	Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law;	58
NASB	Hebrews	8	5	Who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to erect the tabernacle; for, &ldquo;SEE,&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;THAT YOU MAKE all things ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN WHICH WAS SHOWN YOU ON THE MOUNTAIN.&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	8	6	But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, by as much as He is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises.	58
NASB	Hebrews	8	7	For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion sought for a second.	58
NASB	Hebrews	8	8	For finding fault with them, He says, &ldquo;BEHOLD, DAYS ARE COMING, SAYS THE LORD, WHEN I WILL EFFECT A NEW COVENANT WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND WITH THE HOUSE OF JUDAH;	58
NASB	Hebrews	8	9	NOT LIKE THE COVENANT WHICH I MADE WITH THEIR FATHERS ON THE DAY WHEN I TOOK THEM BY THE HAND TO LEAD THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT; FOR THEY DID NOT CONTINUE IN MY COVENANT, AND I DID NOT CARE FOR THEM, SAYS THE LORD.	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	1	Now even the first covenant had regulations of divine worship and the earthly sanctuary.	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	10	Since they relate only to food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until a time of reformation.	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	11	But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things to come, He entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation;	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	12	And not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, He entered the holy place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption.	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	13	For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh,	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	14	How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	15	For this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, so that, since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	16	For where a covenant is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it.	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	17	For a covenant is valid only when men are dead, for it is never in force while the one who made it lives.	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	18	Therefore even the first covenant was not inaugurated without blood.	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	19	For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	2	For there was a tabernacle prepared, the outer one, in which were the lampstand and the table and the sacred bread; this is called the holy place.	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	20	Saying, &ldquo;THIS IS THE BLOOD OF THE COVENANT WHICH GOD COMMANDED YOU.&rdquo;	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	21	And in the same way he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry with the blood.	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	22	And according to the Law, one may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	23	Therefore it was necessary for the copies of the things in the heavens to be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	24	For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands, a mere copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	25	Nor was it that He would offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the holy place year by year with blood that is not his own.	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	26	Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	27	And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment,	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	28	So Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time for salvation without reference to sin, to those who eagerly await Him.	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	3	Behind the second veil there was a tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	4	Having a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden jar holding the manna, and Aaron&rsquo;s rod which budded, and the tables of the covenant;	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	5	And above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat; but of these things we cannot now speak in detail.	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	6	Now when these things have been so prepared, the priests are continually entering the outer tabernacle performing the divine worship,	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	7	But into the second, only the high priest enters once a year, not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance.	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	8	The Holy Spirit is signifying this, that the way into the holy place has not yet been disclosed while the outer tabernacle is still standing,	58
NASB	Hebrews	9	9	Which is a symbol for the present time. Accordingly both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make the worshiper perfect in conscience,	58
NASB	James	1	1	James, a bond-servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes who are dispersed abroad: Greetings.	59
NASB	James	1	10	And the rich man is to glory in his humiliation, because like flowering grass he will pass away.	59
NASB	James	1	11	For the sun rises with a scorching wind and withers the grass; and its flower falls off and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed; so too the rich man in the midst of his pursuits will fade away.	59
NASB	James	1	12	Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.	59
NASB	James	1	13	Let no one say when he is tempted, &ldquo;I am being tempted by God&rdquo;; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone.	59
NASB	James	1	14	But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust.	59
NASB	James	1	15	Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death.	59
NASB	James	1	16	Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren.	59
NASB	James	1	17	Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow.	59
NASB	James	1	18	In the exercise of His will He brought us forth by the word of truth, so that we would be a kind of first fruits among His creatures.	59
NASB	James	1	19	This you know, my beloved brethren. But everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger;	59
NASB	James	1	2	Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials,	59
NASB	James	1	20	For the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God.	59
NASB	James	1	21	Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness, in humility receive the word implanted, which is able to save your souls.	59
NASB	James	1	22	But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves.	59
NASB	James	1	23	For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror;	59
NASB	James	1	24	For once he has looked at himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was.	59
NASB	James	1	25	But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the law of liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an effectual doer, this man will be blessed in what he does.	59
NASB	James	1	26	If anyone thinks himself to be religious, and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this man&rsquo;s religion is worthless.	59
NASB	James	1	27	Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of our God and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.	59
NASB	James	1	3	Knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.	59
NASB	James	1	4	And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.	59
NASB	James	1	5	But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.	59
NASB	James	1	6	But he must ask in faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind.	59
NASB	James	1	7	For that man ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord,	59
NASB	James	1	8	Being a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.	59
NASB	James	1	9	But the brother of humble circumstances is to glory in his high position;	59
NASB	James	2	1	My brethren, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with an attitude of personal favoritism.	59
NASB	James	2	10	For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all.	59
NASB	James	2	11	For He who said, &ldquo;DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY,&rdquo; also said, &ldquo;DO NOT COMMIT MURDER.&rdquo; Now if you do not commit adultery, but do commit murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.	59
NASB	James	2	12	So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty.	59
NASB	James	2	13	For judgment will be merciless to one who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.	59
NASB	James	2	14	What use is it, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but he has no works? Can that faith save him?	59
NASB	James	2	15	If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food,	59
NASB	James	2	16	And one of you says to them, &ldquo;Go in peace, be warmed and be filled,&rdquo; and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that?	59
NASB	James	2	17	Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself.	59
NASB	James	2	18	But someone may well say, &ldquo;You have faith and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.&rdquo;	59
NASB	James	2	19	You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder.	59
NASB	James	2	2	For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes, and there also comes in a poor man in dirty clothes,	59
NASB	James	2	20	But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless?	59
NASB	James	2	21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?	59
NASB	James	2	22	You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected;	59
NASB	James	2	23	And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, &ldquo;AND ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS RECKONED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS,&rdquo; and he was called the friend of God.	59
NASB	James	2	24	You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.	59
NASB	James	2	25	In the same way, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?	59
NASB	James	2	26	For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.	59
NASB	James	2	3	And you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the fine clothes, and say, &ldquo;You sit here in a good place,&rdquo; and you say to the poor man, &ldquo;You stand over there, or sit down by my footstool,&rdquo;	59
NASB	James	2	4	Have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil motives?	59
NASB	James	2	5	Listen, my beloved brethren: did not God choose the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?	59
NASB	James	2	6	But you have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress you and personally drag you into court?	59
NASB	James	2	7	Do they not blaspheme the fair name by which you have been called?	59
NASB	James	2	8	If, however, you are fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture, &ldquo;YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF,&rdquo; you are doing well.	59
NASB	James	2	9	But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.	59
NASB	James	3	1	Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren, knowing that as such we will incur a stricter judgment.	59
NASB	James	3	10	From the same mouth come both blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be this way.	59
NASB	James	3	11	Does a fountain send out from the same opening both fresh and bitter water?	59
NASB	James	3	12	Can a fig tree, my brethren, produce olives, or a vine produce figs? Nor can salt water produce fresh.	59
NASB	James	3	13	Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom.	59
NASB	James	3	14	But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and so lie against the truth.	59
NASB	James	3	15	This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, natural, demonic.	59
NASB	James	3	16	For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing.	59
NASB	James	3	17	But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy.	59
NASB	James	3	18	And the seed whose fruit is righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.	59
NASB	James	3	2	For we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well.	59
NASB	James	3	3	Now if we put the bits into the horses&rsquo; mouths so that they will obey us, we direct their entire body as well.	59
NASB	James	3	4	Look at the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by strong winds, are still directed by a very small rudder wherever the inclination of the pilot desires.	59
NASB	James	3	5	So also the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it boasts of great things. See how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire!	59
NASB	James	3	6	And the tongue is a fire, the very world of iniquity; the tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body, and sets on fire the course of our life, and is set on fire by hell.	59
NASB	James	3	7	For every species of beasts and birds, of reptiles and creatures of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by the human race.	59
NASB	James	3	8	But no one can tame the tongue; it is a restless evil and full of deadly poison.	59
NASB	James	3	9	With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God;	59
NASB	James	4	1	What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you? Is not the source your pleasures that wage war in your members?	59
NASB	James	4	10	Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you.	59
NASB	James	4	11	Do not speak against one another, brethren. He who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law; but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge of it.	59
NASB	James	4	12	There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is able to save and to destroy; but who are you who judge your neighbor?	59
NASB	James	4	13	Come now, you who say, &ldquo;Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit.&rdquo;	59
NASB	James	4	14	Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. You are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.	59
NASB	James	4	15	Instead, you ought to say, &ldquo;If the Lord wills, we will live and also do this or that.&rdquo;	59
NASB	James	4	16	But as it is, you boast in your arrogance; all such boasting is evil.	59
NASB	James	4	17	Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, to him it is sin.	59
NASB	James	4	2	You lust and do not have; so you commit murder. You are envious and cannot obtain; so you fight and quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask.	59
NASB	James	4	3	You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures.	59
NASB	James	4	4	You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.	59
NASB	James	4	5	Or do you think that the Scripture speaks to no purpose: &ldquo;He jealously desires the Spirit which He has made to dwell in us&rdquo;?	59
NASB	James	4	6	But He gives a greater grace. Therefore it says, &ldquo;GOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE.&rdquo;	59
NASB	James	4	7	Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.	59
NASB	James	4	8	Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.	59
NASB	James	4	9	Be miserable and mourn and weep; let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy to gloom.	59
NASB	James	5	1	Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries which are coming upon you.	59
NASB	James	5	10	As an example, brethren, of suffering and patience, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.	59
NASB	James	5	11	We count those blessed who endured. You have heard of the endurance of Job and have seen the outcome of the Lord&rsquo;s dealings, that the Lord is full of compassion and is merciful.	59
NASB	James	5	12	But above all, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath; but your yes is to be yes, and your no, no, so that you may not fall under judgment.	59
NASB	James	5	13	Is anyone among you suffering? Then he must pray. Is anyone cheerful? He is to sing praises.	59
NASB	James	5	14	Is anyone among you sick? Then he must call for the elders of the church and they are to pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord;	59
NASB	James	5	15	And the prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven him.	59
NASB	James	5	16	Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed. The effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much.	59
NASB	James	5	17	Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.	59
NASB	James	5	18	Then he prayed again, and the sky poured rain and the earth produced its fruit.	59
NASB	James	5	19	My brethren, if any among you strays from the truth and one turns him back,	59
NASB	James	5	2	Your riches have rotted and your garments have become moth-eaten.	59
NASB	James	5	20	Let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.	59
NASB	James	5	3	Your gold and your silver have rusted; and their rust will be a witness against you and will consume your flesh like fire. It is in the last days that you have stored up your treasure!	59
NASB	James	5	4	Behold, the pay of the laborers who mowed your fields, and which has been withheld by you, cries out against you; and the outcry of those who did the harvesting has reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.	59
NASB	James	5	5	You have lived luxuriously on the earth and led a life of wanton pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.	59
NASB	James	5	6	You have condemned and put to death the righteous man; he does not resist you.	59
NASB	James	5	7	Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. The farmer waits for the precious produce of the soil, being patient about it, until it gets the early and late rains.	59
NASB	James	5	8	You too be patient; strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near.	59
NASB	James	5	9	Do not complain, brethren, against one another, so that you yourselves may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing right at the door.	59
NASB	John	1	1	In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.	43
NASB	John	1	10	He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him.	43
NASB	John	1	11	He came to His own, and those who were His own did not receive Him.	43
NASB	John	1	12	But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even to those who believe in His name,	43
NASB	John	1	13	Who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.	43
NASB	John	1	14	And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.	43
NASB	John	1	15	John testified about Him and cried out, saying, &ldquo;This was He of whom I said, &lsquo;He who comes after me has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me.&rsquo;&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	1	16	For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.	43
NASB	John	1	17	For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.	43
NASB	John	1	18	No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten God who is in the bosom of the Father, He has explained Him.	43
NASB	John	1	19	This is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	1	2	He was in the beginning with God.	43
NASB	John	1	20	And he confessed and did not deny, but confessed, &ldquo;I am not the Christ.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	1	21	They asked him, &ldquo;What then? Are you Elijah?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;I am not.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you the Prophet?&rdquo; And he answered, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	1	22	Then they said to him, &ldquo;Who are you, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	1	23	He said, &ldquo;I am A VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, &lsquo;MAKE STRAIGHT THE WAY OF THE LORD,&rsquo; as Isaiah the prophet said.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	1	24	Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.	43
NASB	John	1	25	They asked him, and said to him, &ldquo;Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	1	26	John answered them saying, &ldquo;I baptize in water, but among you stands One whom you do not know.	43
NASB	John	1	27	&ldquo;It is He who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	1	28	These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.	43
NASB	John	1	29	The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!	43
NASB	John	1	3	All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being.	43
NASB	John	1	30	&ldquo;This is He on behalf of whom I said, &lsquo;After me comes a Man who has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me.&rsquo;	43
NASB	John	1	31	&ldquo;I did not recognize Him, but so that He might be manifested to Israel, I came baptizing in water.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	1	32	John testified saying, &ldquo;I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He remained upon Him.	43
NASB	John	1	33	&ldquo;I did not recognize Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water said to me, &lsquo;He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him, this is the One who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.&rsquo;	43
NASB	John	1	34	&ldquo;I myself have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	1	35	Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,	43
NASB	John	1	36	And he looked at Jesus as He walked, and said, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God!&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	1	37	The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.	43
NASB	John	1	38	And Jesus turned and saw them following, and said to them, &ldquo;What do you seek?&rdquo; They said to Him, &ldquo;Rabbi (which translated means Teacher), where are You staying?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	1	39	He said to them, &ldquo;Come, and you will see.&rdquo; So they came and saw where He was staying; and they stayed with Him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.	43
NASB	John	1	4	In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men.	43
NASB	John	1	40	One of the two who heard John speak and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter&rsquo;s brother.	43
NASB	John	1	41	He found first his own brother Simon and said to him, &ldquo;We have found the Messiah&rdquo; (which translated means Christ).	43
NASB	John	1	42	He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, &ldquo;You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas&rdquo; (which is translated Peter).	43
NASB	John	1	43	The next day He purposed to go into Galilee, and He found Philip. And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Follow Me.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	1	44	Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.	43
NASB	John	1	45	Philip found Nathanael and said to him, &ldquo;We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and also the Prophets wrote&mdash;Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	1	46	Nathanael said to him, &ldquo;Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?&rdquo; Philip said to him, &ldquo;Come and see.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	1	47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him, and said of him, &ldquo;Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	1	48	Nathanael said to Him, &ldquo;How do You know me?&rdquo; Jesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	1	49	Nathanael answered Him, &ldquo;Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	1	5	The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.	43
NASB	John	1	50	Jesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	1	51	And He said to him, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see the heavens opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	1	6	There came a man sent from God, whose name was John.	43
NASB	John	1	7	He came as a witness, to testify about the Light, so that all might believe through him.	43
NASB	John	1	8	He was not the Light, but he came to testify about the Light.	43
NASB	John	1	9	There was the true Light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man.	43
NASB	John	10	1	&ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbs up some other way, he is a thief and a robber.	43
NASB	John	10	10	&ldquo;The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly.	43
NASB	John	10	11	&ldquo;I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.	43
NASB	John	10	12	&ldquo;He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who is not the owner of the sheep, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.	43
NASB	John	10	13	&ldquo;He flees because he is a hired hand and is not concerned about the sheep.	43
NASB	John	10	14	&ldquo;I am the good shepherd, and I know My own and My own know Me,	43
NASB	John	10	15	Even as the Father knows Me and I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.	43
NASB	John	10	16	&ldquo;I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will hear My voice; and they will become one flock with one shepherd.	43
NASB	John	10	17	&ldquo;For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay down My life so that I may take it again.	43
NASB	John	10	18	&ldquo;No one has taken it away from Me, but I lay it down on My own initiative. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This commandment I received from My Father.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	10	19	A division occurred again among the Jews because of these words.	43
NASB	John	10	2	&ldquo;But he who enters by the door is a shepherd of the sheep.	43
NASB	John	10	20	Many of them were saying, &ldquo;He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to Him?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	10	21	Others were saying, &ldquo;These are not the sayings of one demon-possessed. A demon cannot open the eyes of the blind, can he?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	10	22	At that time the Feast of the Dedication took place at Jerusalem;	43
NASB	John	10	23	It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple in the portico of Solomon.	43
NASB	John	10	24	The Jews then gathered around Him, and were saying to Him, &ldquo;How long will You keep us in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	10	25	Jesus answered them, &ldquo;I told you, and you do not believe; the works that I do in My Father&rsquo;s name, these testify of Me.	43
NASB	John	10	26	&ldquo;But you do not believe because you are not of My sheep.	43
NASB	John	10	27	&ldquo;My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me;	43
NASB	John	10	28	And I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand.	43
NASB	John	10	29	&ldquo;My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father&rsquo;s hand.	43
NASB	John	10	3	&ldquo;To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.	43
NASB	John	10	30	&ldquo;I and the Father are one.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	10	31	The Jews picked up stones again to stone Him.	43
NASB	John	10	32	Jesus answered them, &ldquo;I showed you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you stoning Me?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	10	33	The Jews answered Him, &ldquo;For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	10	34	Jesus answered them, &ldquo;Has it not been written in your Law, &lsquo;I SAID, YOU ARE GODS&rsquo;?	43
NASB	John	10	35	&ldquo;If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken),	43
NASB	John	10	36	Do you say of Him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, &lsquo;You are blaspheming,&rsquo; because I said, &lsquo;I am the Son of God&rsquo;?	43
NASB	John	10	37	&ldquo;If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me;	43
NASB	John	10	38	But if I do them, though you do not believe Me, believe the works, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	10	39	Therefore they were seeking again to seize Him, and He eluded their grasp.	43
NASB	John	10	4	&ldquo;When he puts forth all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.	43
NASB	John	10	40	And He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was first baptizing, and He was staying there.	43
NASB	John	10	41	Many came to Him and were saying, &ldquo;While John performed no sign, yet everything John said about this man was true.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	10	42	Many believed in Him there.	43
NASB	John	10	5	&ldquo;A stranger they simply will not follow, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	10	6	This figure of speech Jesus spoke to them, but they did not understand what those things were which He had been saying to them.	43
NASB	John	10	7	So Jesus said to them again, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.	43
NASB	John	10	8	&ldquo;All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.	43
NASB	John	10	9	&ldquo;I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.	43
NASB	John	11	1	Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.	43
NASB	John	11	10	&ldquo;But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	11	This He said, and after that He said to them, &ldquo;Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I go, so that I may awaken him out of sleep.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	12	The disciples then said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	13	Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that He was speaking of literal sleep.	43
NASB	John	11	14	So Jesus then said to them plainly, &ldquo;Lazarus is dead,	43
NASB	John	11	15	And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe; but let us go to him.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	16	Therefore Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, &ldquo;Let us also go, so that we may die with Him.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	17	So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days.	43
NASB	John	11	18	Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off;	43
NASB	John	11	19	And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.	43
NASB	John	11	2	It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.	43
NASB	John	11	20	Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet Him, but Mary stayed at the house.	43
NASB	John	11	21	Martha then said to Jesus, &ldquo;Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.	43
NASB	John	11	22	&ldquo;Even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	23	Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Your brother will rise again.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	24	Martha said to Him, &ldquo;I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	25	Jesus said to her, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me will live even if he dies,	43
NASB	John	11	26	And everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	27	She said to Him, &ldquo;Yes, Lord; I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God, even He who comes into the world.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	28	When she had said this, she went away and called Mary her sister, saying secretly, &ldquo;The Teacher is here and is calling for you.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	29	And when she heard it, she got up quickly and was coming to Him.	43
NASB	John	11	3	So the sisters sent word to Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	30	Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met Him.	43
NASB	John	11	31	Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and consoling her, when they saw that Mary got up quickly and went out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.	43
NASB	John	11	32	Therefore, when Mary came where Jesus was, she saw Him, and fell at His feet, saying to Him, &ldquo;Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	33	When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, He was deeply moved in spirit and was troubled,	43
NASB	John	11	34	And said, &ldquo;Where have you laid him?&rdquo; They said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, come and see.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	35	Jesus wept.	43
NASB	John	11	36	So the Jews were saying, &ldquo;See how He loved him!&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	37	But some of them said, &ldquo;Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind man, have kept this man also from dying?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	38	So Jesus, again being deeply moved within, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.	43
NASB	John	11	39	Jesus said, &ldquo;Remove the stone.&rdquo; Martha, the sister of the deceased, said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, by this time there will be a stench, for he has been dead four days.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	4	But when Jesus heard this, He said, &ldquo;This sickness is not to end in death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by it.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	40	Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Did I not say to you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	41	So they removed the stone. Then Jesus raised His eyes, and said, &ldquo;Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.	43
NASB	John	11	42	&ldquo;I knew that You always hear Me; but because of the people standing around I said it, so that they may believe that You sent Me.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	43	When He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, &ldquo;Lazarus, come forth.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	44	The man who had died came forth, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Unbind him, and let him go.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	45	Therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary, and saw what He had done, believed in Him.	43
NASB	John	11	46	But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done.	43
NASB	John	11	47	Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees convened a council, and were saying, &ldquo;What are we doing? For this man is performing many signs.	43
NASB	John	11	48	&ldquo;If we let Him go on like this, all men will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	49	But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, &ldquo;You know nothing at all,	43
NASB	John	11	5	Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.	43
NASB	John	11	50	Nor do you take into account that it is expedient for you that one man die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	51	Now he did not say this on his own initiative, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation,	43
NASB	John	11	52	And not for the nation only, but in order that He might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.	43
NASB	John	11	53	So from that day on they planned together to kill Him.	43
NASB	John	11	54	Therefore Jesus no longer continued to walk publicly among the Jews, but went away from there to the country near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there He stayed with the disciples.	43
NASB	John	11	55	Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover to purify themselves.	43
NASB	John	11	56	So they were seeking for Jesus, and were saying to one another as they stood in the temple, &ldquo;What do you think; that He will not come to the feast at all?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	57	Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was, he was to report it, so that they might seize Him.	43
NASB	John	11	6	So when He heard that he was sick, He then stayed two days longer in the place where He was.	43
NASB	John	11	7	Then after this He said to the disciples, &ldquo;Let us go to Judea again.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	8	The disciples said to Him, &ldquo;Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and are You going there again?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	11	9	Jesus answered, &ldquo;Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.	43
NASB	John	12	1	Jesus, therefore, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.	43
NASB	John	12	10	But the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death also;	43
NASB	John	12	11	Because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and were believing in Jesus.	43
NASB	John	12	12	On the next day the large crowd who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,	43
NASB	John	12	13	Took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him, and began to shout, &ldquo;Hosanna! BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD, even the King of Israel.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	12	14	Jesus, finding a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written,	43
NASB	John	12	15	&ldquo;FEAR NOT, DAUGHTER OF ZION; BEHOLD, YOUR KING IS COMING, SEATED ON A DONKEY&rsquo;s COLT.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	12	16	These things His disciples did not understand at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of Him, and that they had done these things to Him.	43
NASB	John	12	17	So the people, who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, continued to testify about Him.	43
NASB	John	12	18	For this reason also the people went and met Him, because they heard that He had performed this sign.	43
NASB	John	12	19	So the Pharisees said to one another, &ldquo;You see that you are not doing any good; look, the world has gone after Him.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	12	2	So they made Him a supper there, and Martha was serving; but Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with Him.	43
NASB	John	12	20	Now there were some Greeks among those who were going up to worship at the feast;	43
NASB	John	12	21	These then came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and began to ask him, saying, &ldquo;Sir, we wish to see Jesus.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	12	22	Philip came and told Andrew; Andrew and Philip came and told Jesus.	43
NASB	John	12	23	And Jesus answered them, saying, &ldquo;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.	43
NASB	John	12	24	&ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.	43
NASB	John	12	25	&ldquo;He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it to life eternal.	43
NASB	John	12	26	&ldquo;If anyone serves Me, he must follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also; if anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.	43
NASB	John	12	27	&ldquo;Now My soul has become troubled; and what shall I say, &lsquo;Father, save Me from this hour&rsquo;? But for this purpose I came to this hour.	43
NASB	John	12	28	&ldquo;Father, glorify Your name.&rdquo; Then a voice came out of heaven: &ldquo;I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	12	29	So the crowd of people who stood by and heard it were saying that it had thundered; others were saying, &ldquo;An angel has spoken to Him.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	12	3	Mary then took a pound of very costly perfume of pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped His feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.	43
NASB	John	12	30	Jesus answered and said, &ldquo;This voice has not come for My sake, but for your sakes.	43
NASB	John	12	31	&ldquo;Now judgment is upon this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.	43
NASB	John	12	32	&ldquo;And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	12	33	But He was saying this to indicate the kind of death by which He was to die.	43
NASB	John	12	34	The crowd then answered Him, &ldquo;We have heard out of the Law that the Christ is to remain forever; and how can You say, &lsquo;The Son of Man must be lifted up&rsquo;? Who is this Son of Man?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	12	35	So Jesus said to them, &ldquo;For a little while longer the Light is among you. Walk while you have the Light, so that darkness will not overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes.	43
NASB	John	12	36	&ldquo;While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so that you may become sons of Light.&rdquo; These things Jesus spoke, and He went away and hid Himself from them.	43
NASB	John	12	37	But though He had performed so many signs before them, yet they were not believing in Him.	43
NASB	John	12	38	This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet which he spoke: &ldquo;LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT? AND TO WHOM HAS THE ARM OF THE LORD BEEN REVEALED?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	12	39	For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah said again,	43
NASB	John	12	4	But Judas Iscariot, one of His disciples, who was intending to betray Him, said,	43
NASB	John	12	40	&ldquo;HE HAS BLINDED THEIR EYES AND HE HARDENED THEIR HEART, SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT SEE WITH THEIR EYES AND PERCEIVE WITH THEIR HEART, AND BE CONVERTED AND I HEAL THEM.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	12	41	These things Isaiah said because he saw His glory, and he spoke of Him.	43
NASB	John	12	42	Nevertheless many even of the rulers believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they were not confessing Him, for fear that they would be put out of the synagogue;	43
NASB	John	12	43	For they loved the approval of men rather than the approval of God.	43
NASB	John	12	44	And Jesus cried out and said, &ldquo;He who believes in Me, does not believe in Me but in Him who sent Me.	43
NASB	John	12	45	&ldquo;He who sees Me sees the One who sent Me.	43
NASB	John	12	46	&ldquo;I have come as Light into the world, so that everyone who believes in Me will not remain in darkness.	43
NASB	John	12	47	&ldquo;If anyone hears My sayings and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.	43
NASB	John	12	48	&ldquo;He who rejects Me and does not receive My sayings, has one who judges him; the word I spoke is what will judge him at the last day.	43
NASB	John	12	49	&ldquo;For I did not speak on My own initiative, but the Father Himself who sent Me has given Me a commandment as to what to say and what to speak.	43
NASB	John	12	5	&ldquo;Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to poor people?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	12	50	&ldquo;I know that His commandment is eternal life; therefore the things I speak, I speak just as the Father has told Me.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	12	6	Now he said this, not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief, and as he had the money box, he used to pilfer what was put into it.	43
NASB	John	12	7	Therefore Jesus said, &ldquo;Let her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of My burial.	43
NASB	John	12	8	&ldquo;For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have Me.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	12	9	The large crowd of the Jews then learned that He was there; and they came, not for Jesus&rsquo; sake only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom He raised from the dead.	43
NASB	John	13	1	Now before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus knowing that His hour had come that He would depart out of this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end.	43
NASB	John	13	10	Jesus said to him, &ldquo;He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, but not all of you.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	13	11	For He knew the one who was betraying Him; for this reason He said, &ldquo;Not all of you are clean.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	13	12	So when He had washed their feet, and taken His garments and reclined at the table again, He said to them, &ldquo;Do you know what I have done to you?	43
NASB	John	13	13	&ldquo;You call Me Teacher and Lord; and you are right, for so I am.	43
NASB	John	13	14	&ldquo;If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another&rsquo;s feet.	43
NASB	John	13	15	&ldquo;For I gave you an example that you also should do as I did to you.	43
NASB	John	13	16	&ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, a slave is not greater than his master, nor is one who is sent greater than the one who sent him.	43
NASB	John	13	17	&ldquo;If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.	43
NASB	John	13	18	&ldquo;I do not speak of all of you. I know the ones I have chosen; but it is that the Scripture may be fulfilled, &lsquo;HE WHO EATS MY BREAD HAS LIFTED UP HIS HEEL AGAINST ME.&rsquo;	43
NASB	John	13	19	&ldquo;From now on I am telling you before it comes to pass, so that when it does occur, you may believe that I am He.	43
NASB	John	13	2	During supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray Him,	43
NASB	John	13	20	&ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives whomever I send receives Me; and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	13	21	When Jesus had said this, He became troubled in spirit, and testified and said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you will betray Me.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	13	22	The disciples began looking at one another, at a loss to know of which one He was speaking.	43
NASB	John	13	23	There was reclining on Jesus&rsquo; bosom one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved.	43
NASB	John	13	24	So Simon Peter gestured to him, and said to him, &ldquo;Tell us who it is of whom He is speaking.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	13	25	He, leaning back thus on Jesus&rsquo; bosom, said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, who is it?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	13	26	Jesus then answered, &ldquo;That is the one for whom I shall dip the morsel and give it to him.&rdquo; So when He had dipped the morsel, He took and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.	43
NASB	John	13	27	After the morsel, Satan then entered into him. Therefore Jesus said to him, &ldquo;What you do, do quickly.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	13	28	Now no one of those reclining at the table knew for what purpose He had said this to him.	43
NASB	John	13	29	For some were supposing, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus was saying to him, &ldquo;Buy the things we have need of for the feast&rdquo;; or else, that he should give something to the poor.	43
NASB	John	13	3	Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come forth from God and was going back to God,	43
NASB	John	13	30	So after receiving the morsel he went out immediately; and it was night.	43
NASB	John	13	31	Therefore when he had gone out, Jesus said, &ldquo;Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him;	43
NASB	John	13	32	If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately.	43
NASB	John	13	33	&ldquo;Little children, I am with you a little while longer. You will seek Me; and as I said to the Jews, now I also say to you, &lsquo;Where I am going, you cannot come.&rsquo;	43
NASB	John	13	34	&ldquo;A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.	43
NASB	John	13	35	&ldquo;By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	13	36	Simon Peter said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, where are You going?&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo;Where I go, you cannot follow Me now; but you will follow later.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	13	37	Peter said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, why can I not follow You right now? I will lay down my life for You.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	13	38	Jesus answered, &ldquo;Will you lay down your life for Me? Truly, truly, I say to you, a rooster will not crow until you deny Me three times.	43
NASB	John	13	4	Got up from supper, and laid aside His garments; and taking a towel, He girded Himself.	43
NASB	John	13	5	Then He poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples&rsquo; feet and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded.	43
NASB	John	13	6	So He came to Simon Peter. He said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, do You wash my feet?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	13	7	Jesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;What I do you do not realize now, but you will understand hereafter.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	13	8	Peter said to Him, &ldquo;Never shall You wash my feet!&rdquo; Jesus answered him, &ldquo;If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	13	9	Simon Peter said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, then wash not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	14	1	&ldquo;Do not let your heart be troubled; believe in God, believe also in Me.	43
NASB	John	14	10	&ldquo;Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on My own initiative, but the Father abiding in Me does His works.	43
NASB	John	14	11	&ldquo;Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me; otherwise believe because of the works themselves.	43
NASB	John	14	12	&ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do, he will do also; and greater works than these he will do; because I go to the Father.	43
NASB	John	14	13	&ldquo;Whatever you ask in My name, that will I do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.	43
NASB	John	14	14	&ldquo;If you ask Me anything in My name, I will do it.	43
NASB	John	14	15	&ldquo;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.	43
NASB	John	14	16	&ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may be with you forever;	43
NASB	John	14	17	That is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see Him or know Him, but you know Him because He abides with you and will be in you.	43
NASB	John	14	18	&ldquo;I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.	43
NASB	John	14	19	&ldquo;After a little while the world will no longer see Me, but you will see Me; because I live, you will live also.	43
NASB	John	14	2	&ldquo;In My Father&rsquo;s house are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.	43
NASB	John	14	20	&ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.	43
NASB	John	14	21	&ldquo;He who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will disclose Myself to him.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	14	22	Judas (not Iscariot) said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, what then has happened that You are going to disclose Yourself to us and not to the world?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	14	23	Jesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our abode with him.	43
NASB	John	14	24	&ldquo;He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father&rsquo;s who sent Me.	43
NASB	John	14	25	&ldquo;These things I have spoken to you while abiding with you.	43
NASB	John	14	26	&ldquo;But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you.	43
NASB	John	14	27	&ldquo;Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, nor let it be fearful.	43
NASB	John	14	28	&ldquo;You heard that I said to you, &lsquo;I go away, and I will come to you.&rsquo; If you loved Me, you would have rejoiced because I go to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.	43
NASB	John	14	29	&ldquo;Now I have told you before it happens, so that when it happens, you may believe.	43
NASB	John	14	3	&ldquo;If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also.	43
NASB	John	14	30	&ldquo;I will not speak much more with you, for the ruler of the world is coming, and he has nothing in Me;	43
NASB	John	14	31	But so that the world may know that I love the Father, I do exactly as the Father commanded Me. Get up, let us go from here.	43
NASB	John	14	4	&ldquo;And you know the way where I am going.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	14	5	Thomas said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, we do not know where You are going, how do we know the way?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	14	6	Jesus said to him, &ldquo;I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me.	43
NASB	John	14	7	&ldquo;If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; from now on you know Him, and have seen Him.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	14	8	Philip said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	14	9	Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Have I been so long with you, and yet you have not come to know Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how can you say, &lsquo;Show us the Father&rsquo;?	43
NASB	John	15	1	&ldquo;I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser.	43
NASB	John	15	10	&ldquo;If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love; just as I have kept My Father&rsquo;s commandments and abide in His love.	43
NASB	John	15	11	&ldquo;These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you, and that your joy may be made full.	43
NASB	John	15	12	&ldquo;This is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you.	43
NASB	John	15	13	&ldquo;Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends.	43
NASB	John	15	14	&ldquo;You are My friends if you do what I command you.	43
NASB	John	15	15	&ldquo;No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard from My Father I have made known to you.	43
NASB	John	15	16	&ldquo;You did not choose Me but I chose you, and appointed you that you would go and bear fruit, and that your fruit would remain, so that whatever you ask of the Father in My name He may give to you.	43
NASB	John	15	17	&ldquo;This I command you, that you love one another.	43
NASB	John	15	18	&ldquo;If the world hates you, you know that it has hated Me before it hated you.	43
NASB	John	15	19	&ldquo;If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, because of this the world hates you.	43
NASB	John	15	2	&ldquo;Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it so that it may bear more fruit.	43
NASB	John	15	20	&ldquo;Remember the word that I said to you, &lsquo;A slave is not greater than his master.&rsquo; If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you; if they kept My word, they will keep yours also.	43
NASB	John	15	21	&ldquo;But all these things they will do to you for My name&rsquo;s sake, because they do not know the One who sent Me.	43
NASB	John	15	22	&ldquo;If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.	43
NASB	John	15	23	&ldquo;He who hates Me hates My Father also.	43
NASB	John	15	24	&ldquo;If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated Me and My Father as well.	43
NASB	John	15	25	&ldquo;But they have done this to fulfill the word that is written in their Law, &lsquo;THEY HATED ME WITHOUT A CAUSE.&rsquo;	43
NASB	John	15	26	&ldquo;When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, that is the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will testify about Me,	43
NASB	John	15	27	And you will testify also, because you have been with Me from the beginning.	43
NASB	John	15	3	&ldquo;You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.	43
NASB	John	15	4	&ldquo;Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me.	43
NASB	John	15	5	&ldquo;I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.	43
NASB	John	15	6	&ldquo;If anyone does not abide in Me, he is thrown away as a branch and dries up; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire and they are burned.	43
NASB	John	15	7	&ldquo;If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.	43
NASB	John	15	8	&ldquo;My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be My disciples.	43
NASB	John	15	9	&ldquo;Just as the Father has loved Me, I have also loved you; abide in My love.	43
NASB	John	16	1	&ldquo;These things I have spoken to you so that you may be kept from stumbling.	43
NASB	John	16	10	And concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no longer see Me;	43
NASB	John	16	11	And concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.	43
NASB	John	16	12	&ldquo;I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.	43
NASB	John	16	13	&ldquo;But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.	43
NASB	John	16	14	&ldquo;He will glorify Me, for He will take of Mine and will disclose it to you.	43
NASB	John	16	15	&ldquo;All things that the Father has are Mine; therefore I said that He takes of Mine and will disclose it to you.	43
NASB	John	16	16	&ldquo;A little while, and you will no longer see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	16	17	Some of His disciples then said to one another, &ldquo;What is this thing He is telling us, &lsquo;A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me&rsquo;; and, &lsquo;because I go to the Father&rsquo;?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	16	18	So they were saying, &ldquo;What is this that He says, &lsquo;A little while&rsquo;? We do not know what He is talking about.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	16	19	Jesus knew that they wished to question Him, and He said to them, &ldquo;Are you deliberating together about this, that I said, &lsquo;A little while, and you will not see Me, and again a little while, and you will see Me&rsquo;?	43
NASB	John	16	2	&ldquo;They will make you outcasts from the synagogue, but an hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering service to God.	43
NASB	John	16	20	&ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will grieve, but your grief will be turned into joy.	43
NASB	John	16	21	&ldquo;Whenever a woman is in labor she has pain, because her hour has come; but when she gives birth to the child, she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy that a child has been born into the world.	43
NASB	John	16	22	&ldquo;Therefore you too have grief now; but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.	43
NASB	John	16	23	&ldquo;In that day you will not question Me about anything. Truly, truly, I say to you, if you ask the Father for anything in My name, He will give it to you.	43
NASB	John	16	24	&ldquo;Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be made full.	43
NASB	John	16	25	&ldquo;These things I have spoken to you in figurative language; an hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language, but will tell you plainly of the Father.	43
NASB	John	16	26	&ldquo;In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I will request of the Father on your behalf;	43
NASB	John	16	27	For the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came forth from the Father.	43
NASB	John	16	28	&ldquo;I came forth from the Father and have come into the world; I am leaving the world again and going to the Father.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	16	29	His disciples said, &ldquo;Lo, now You are speaking plainly and are not using a figure of speech.	43
NASB	John	16	3	&ldquo;These things they will do because they have not known the Father or Me.	43
NASB	John	16	30	&ldquo;Now we know that You know all things, and have no need for anyone to question You; by this we believe that You came from God.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	16	31	Jesus answered them, &ldquo;Do you now believe?	43
NASB	John	16	32	&ldquo;Behold, an hour is coming, and has already come, for you to be scattered, each to his own home, and to leave Me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.	43
NASB	John	16	33	&ldquo;These things I have spoken to you, so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	16	4	&ldquo;But these things I have spoken to you, so that when their hour comes, you may remember that I told you of them. These things I did not say to you at the beginning, because I was with you.	43
NASB	John	16	5	&ldquo;But now I am going to Him who sent Me; and none of you asks Me, &lsquo;Where are You going?&rsquo;	43
NASB	John	16	6	&ldquo;But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.	43
NASB	John	16	7	&ldquo;But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you.	43
NASB	John	16	8	&ldquo;And He, when He comes, will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment;	43
NASB	John	16	9	Concerning sin, because they do not believe in Me;	43
NASB	John	17	1	Jesus spoke these things; and lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said, &ldquo;Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son, that the Son may glorify You,	43
NASB	John	17	10	And all things that are Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine; and I have been glorified in them.	43
NASB	John	17	11	&ldquo;I am no longer in the world; and yet they themselves are in the world, and I come to You. Holy Father, keep them in Your name, the name which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We are.	43
NASB	John	17	12	&ldquo;While I was with them, I was keeping them in Your name which You have given Me; and I guarded them and not one of them perished but the son of perdition, so that the Scripture would be fulfilled.	43
NASB	John	17	13	&ldquo;But now I come to You; and these things I speak in the world so that they may have My joy made full in themselves.	43
NASB	John	17	14	&ldquo;I have given them Your word; and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.	43
NASB	John	17	15	&ldquo;I do not ask You to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil one.	43
NASB	John	17	16	&ldquo;They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.	43
NASB	John	17	17	&ldquo;Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.	43
NASB	John	17	18	&ldquo;As You sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.	43
NASB	John	17	19	&ldquo;For their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.	43
NASB	John	17	2	Even as You gave Him authority over all flesh, that to all whom You have given Him, He may give eternal life.	43
NASB	John	17	20	&ldquo;I do not ask on behalf of these alone, but for those also who believe in Me through their word;	43
NASB	John	17	21	That they may all be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me.	43
NASB	John	17	22	&ldquo;The glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, just as We are one;	43
NASB	John	17	23	I in them and You in Me, that they may be perfected in unity, so that the world may know that You sent Me, and loved them, even as You have loved Me.	43
NASB	John	17	24	&ldquo;Father, I desire that they also, whom You have given Me, be with Me where I am, so that they may see My glory which You have given Me, for You loved Me before the foundation of the world.	43
NASB	John	17	25	&ldquo;O righteous Father, although the world has not known You, yet I have known You; and these have known that You sent Me;	43
NASB	John	17	26	And I have made Your name known to them, and will make it known, so that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	17	3	&ldquo;This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.	43
NASB	John	17	4	&ldquo;I glorified You on the earth, having accomplished the work which You have given Me to do.	43
NASB	John	17	5	&ldquo;Now, Father, glorify Me together with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.	43
NASB	John	17	6	&ldquo;I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world; they were Yours and You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word.	43
NASB	John	17	7	&ldquo;Now they have come to know that everything You have given Me is from You;	43
NASB	John	17	8	For the words which You gave Me I have given to them; and they received them and truly understood that I came forth from You, and they believed that You sent Me.	43
NASB	John	17	9	&ldquo;I ask on their behalf; I do not ask on behalf of the world, but of those whom You have given Me; for they are Yours;	43
NASB	John	18	1	When Jesus had spoken these words, He went forth with His disciples over the ravine of the Kidron, where there was a garden, in which He entered with His disciples.	43
NASB	John	18	10	Simon Peter then, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest&rsquo;s slave, and cut off his right ear; and the slave&rsquo;s name was Malchus.	43
NASB	John	18	11	So Jesus said to Peter, &ldquo;Put the sword into the sheath; the cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	18	12	So the Roman cohort and the commander and the officers of the Jews, arrested Jesus and bound Him,	43
NASB	John	18	13	And led Him to Annas first; for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.	43
NASB	John	18	14	Now Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it was expedient for one man to die on behalf of the people.	43
NASB	John	18	15	Simon Peter was following Jesus, and so was another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered with Jesus into the court of the high priest,	43
NASB	John	18	16	But Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought Peter in.	43
NASB	John	18	17	Then the slave-girl who kept the door said to Peter, &ldquo;You are not also one of this man&rsquo;s disciples, are you?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I am not.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	18	18	Now the slaves and the officers were standing there, having made a charcoal fire, for it was cold and they were warming themselves; and Peter was also with them, standing and warming himself.	43
NASB	John	18	19	The high priest then questioned Jesus about His disciples, and about His teaching.	43
NASB	John	18	2	Now Judas also, who was betraying Him, knew the place, for Jesus had often met there with His disciples.	43
NASB	John	18	20	Jesus answered him, &ldquo;I have spoken openly to the world; I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and I spoke nothing in secret.	43
NASB	John	18	21	&ldquo;Why do you question Me? Question those who have heard what I spoke to them; they know what I said.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	18	22	When He had said this, one of the officers standing nearby struck Jesus, saying, &ldquo;Is that the way You answer the high priest?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	18	23	Jesus answered him, &ldquo;If I have spoken wrongly, testify of the wrong; but if rightly, why do you strike Me?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	18	24	So Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.	43
NASB	John	18	25	Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. So they said to him, &ldquo;You are not also one of His disciples, are you?&rdquo; He denied it, and said, &ldquo;I am not.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	18	26	One of the slaves of the high priest, being a relative of the one whose ear Peter cut off, said, &ldquo;Did I not see you in the garden with Him?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	18	27	Peter then denied it again, and immediately a rooster crowed.	43
NASB	John	18	28	Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas into the Praetorium, and it was early; and they themselves did not enter into the Praetorium so that they would not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.	43
NASB	John	18	29	Therefore Pilate went out to them and said, &ldquo;What accusation do you bring against this Man?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	18	3	Judas then, having received the Roman cohort and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns and torches and weapons.	43
NASB	John	18	30	They answered and said to him, &ldquo;If this Man were not an evildoer, we would not have delivered Him to you.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	18	31	So Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Take Him yourselves, and judge Him according to your law.&rdquo; The Jews said to him, &ldquo;We are not permitted to put anyone to death,&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	18	32	To fulfill the word of Jesus which He spoke, signifying by what kind of death He was about to die.	43
NASB	John	18	33	Therefore Pilate entered again into the Praetorium, and summoned Jesus and said to Him, &ldquo;Are You the King of the Jews?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	18	34	Jesus answered, &ldquo;Are you saying this on your own initiative, or did others tell you about Me?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	18	35	Pilate answered, &ldquo;I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered You to me; what have You done?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	18	36	Jesus answered, &ldquo;My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, then My servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews; but as it is, My kingdom is not of this realm.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	18	37	Therefore Pilate said to Him, &ldquo;So You are a king?&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo;You say correctly that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	18	38	Pilate said to Him, &ldquo;What is truth?&rdquo; And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them, &ldquo;I find no guilt in Him.	43
NASB	John	18	39	&ldquo;But you have a custom that I release someone for you at the Passover; do you wish then that I release for you the King of the Jews?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	18	4	So Jesus, knowing all the things that were coming upon Him, went forth and said to them, &ldquo;Whom do you seek?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	18	40	So they cried out again, saying, &ldquo;Not this Man, but Barabbas.&rdquo; Now Barabbas was a robber.	43
NASB	John	18	5	They answered Him, &ldquo;Jesus the Nazarene.&rdquo; He said to them, &ldquo;I am He.&rdquo; And Judas also, who was betraying Him, was standing with them.	43
NASB	John	18	6	So when He said to them, &ldquo;I am He,&rdquo; they drew back and fell to the ground.	43
NASB	John	18	7	Therefore He again asked them, &ldquo;Whom do you seek?&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;Jesus the Nazarene.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	18	8	Jesus answered, &ldquo;I told you that I am He; so if you seek Me, let these go their way,&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	18	9	To fulfill the word which He spoke, &ldquo;Of those whom You have given Me I lost not one.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	19	1	Pilate then took Jesus and scourged Him.	43
NASB	John	19	10	So Pilate said to Him, &ldquo;You do not speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to release You, and I have authority to crucify You?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	19	11	Jesus answered, &ldquo;You would have no authority over Me, unless it had been given you from above; for this reason he who delivered Me to you has the greater sin.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	19	12	As a result of this Pilate made efforts to release Him, but the Jews cried out saying, &ldquo;If you release this Man, you are no friend of Caesar; everyone who makes himself out to be a king opposes Caesar.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	19	13	Therefore when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.	43
NASB	John	19	14	Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, &ldquo;Behold, your King!&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	19	15	So they cried out, &ldquo;Away with Him, away with Him, crucify Him!&rdquo; Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Shall I crucify your King?&rdquo; The chief priests answered, &ldquo;We have no king but Caesar.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	19	16	So he then handed Him over to them to be crucified.	43
NASB	John	19	17	They took Jesus, therefore, and He went out, bearing His own cross, to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.	43
NASB	John	19	18	There they crucified Him, and with Him two other men, one on either side, and Jesus in between.	43
NASB	John	19	19	Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It was written, &ldquo;JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	19	2	And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and put a purple robe on Him;	43
NASB	John	19	20	Therefore many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Latin and in Greek.	43
NASB	John	19	21	So the chief priests of the Jews were saying to Pilate, &ldquo;Do not write, &lsquo;The King of the Jews&rsquo;; but that He said, &lsquo;I am King of the Jews.&rsquo;&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	19	22	Pilate answered, &ldquo;What I have written I have written.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	19	23	Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His outer garments and made four parts, a part to every soldier and also the tunic; now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece.	43
NASB	John	19	24	So they said to one another, &ldquo;Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, to decide whose it shall be&rdquo;; this was to fulfill the Scripture: &ldquo;THEY DIVIDED MY OUTER GARMENTS AMONG THEM, AND FOR MY CLOTHING THEY CAST LOTS.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	19	25	Therefore the soldiers did these things. But standing by the cross of Jesus were His mother, and His mother&rsquo;s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.	43
NASB	John	19	26	When Jesus then saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He said to His mother, &ldquo;Woman, behold, your son!&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	19	27	Then He said to the disciple, &ldquo;Behold, your mother!&rdquo; From that hour the disciple took her into his own household.	43
NASB	John	19	28	After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had already been accomplished, to fulfill the Scripture, said, &ldquo;I am thirsty.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	19	29	A jar full of sour wine was standing there; so they put a sponge full of the sour wine upon a branch of hyssop and brought it up to His mouth.	43
NASB	John	19	3	And they began to come up to Him and say, &ldquo;Hail, King of the Jews!&rdquo; and to give Him slaps in the face.	43
NASB	John	19	30	Therefore when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, &ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo; And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit.	43
NASB	John	19	31	Then the Jews, because it was the day of preparation, so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.	43
NASB	John	19	32	So the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who was crucified with Him;	43
NASB	John	19	33	But coming to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.	43
NASB	John	19	34	But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.	43
NASB	John	19	35	And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe.	43
NASB	John	19	36	For these things came to pass to fulfill the Scripture, &ldquo;NOT A BONE OF HIM SHALL BE BROKEN.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	19	37	And again another Scripture says, &ldquo;THEY SHALL LOOK ON HIM WHOM THEY PIERCED.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	19	38	After these things Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but a secret one for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate granted permission. So he came and took away His body.	43
NASB	John	19	39	Nicodemus, who had first come to Him by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds weight.	43
NASB	John	19	4	Pilate came out again and said to them, &ldquo;Behold, I am bringing Him out to you so that you may know that I find no guilt in Him.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	19	40	So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen wrappings with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.	43
NASB	John	19	41	Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.	43
NASB	John	19	42	Therefore because of the Jewish day of preparation, since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.	43
NASB	John	19	5	Jesus then came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Behold, the Man!&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	19	6	So when the chief priests and the officers saw Him, they cried out saying, &ldquo;Crucify, crucify!&rdquo; Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Take Him yourselves and crucify Him, for I find no guilt in Him.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	19	7	The Jews answered him, &ldquo;We have a law, and by that law He ought to die because He made Himself out to be the Son of God.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	19	8	Therefore when Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid;	43
NASB	John	19	9	And he entered into the Praetorium again and said to Jesus, &ldquo;Where are You from?&rdquo; But Jesus gave him no answer.	43
NASB	John	2	1	On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there;	43
NASB	John	2	10	And said to him, &ldquo;Every man serves the good wine first, and when the people have drunk freely, then he serves the poorer wine; but you have kept the good wine until now.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	2	11	This beginning of His signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory, and His disciples believed in Him.	43
NASB	John	2	12	After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and His brothers and His disciples; and they stayed there a few days.	43
NASB	John	2	13	The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.	43
NASB	John	2	14	And He found in the temple those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers seated at their tables.	43
NASB	John	2	15	And He made a scourge of cords, and drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen; and He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables;	43
NASB	John	2	16	And to those who were selling the doves He said, &ldquo;Take these things away; stop making My Father&rsquo;s house a place of business.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	2	17	His disciples remembered that it was written, &ldquo;ZEAL FOR YOUR HOUSE WILL CONSUME ME.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	2	18	The Jews then said to Him, &ldquo;What sign do You show us as your authority for doing these things?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	2	19	Jesus answered them, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	2	2	And both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding.	43
NASB	John	2	20	The Jews then said, &ldquo;It took forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	2	21	But He was speaking of the temple of His body.	43
NASB	John	2	22	So when He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said this; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.	43
NASB	John	2	23	Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name, observing His signs which He was doing.	43
NASB	John	2	24	But Jesus, on His part, was not entrusting Himself to them, for He knew all men,	43
NASB	John	2	25	And because He did not need anyone to testify concerning man, for He Himself knew what was in man.	43
NASB	John	2	3	When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to Him, &ldquo;They have no wine.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	2	4	And Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Woman, what does that have to do with us? My hour has not yet come.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	2	5	His mother said to the servants, &ldquo;Whatever He says to you, do it.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	2	6	Now there were six stone waterpots set there for the Jewish custom of purification, containing twenty or thirty gallons each.	43
NASB	John	2	7	Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Fill the waterpots with water.&rdquo; So they filled them up to the brim.	43
NASB	John	2	8	And He said to them, &ldquo;Draw some out now and take it to the headwaiter.&rdquo; So they took it to him.	43
NASB	John	2	9	When the headwaiter tasted the water which had become wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the headwaiter called the bridegroom,	43
NASB	John	20	1	Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came early to the tomb, while it was still dark, and saw the stone already taken away from the tomb.	43
NASB	John	20	10	So the disciples went away again to their own homes.	43
NASB	John	20	11	But Mary was standing outside the tomb weeping; and so, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb;	43
NASB	John	20	12	And she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been lying.	43
NASB	John	20	13	And they said to her, &ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping?&rdquo; She said to them, &ldquo;Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	20	14	When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, and did not know that it was Jesus.	43
NASB	John	20	15	Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?&rdquo; Supposing Him to be the gardener, she said to Him, &ldquo;Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you have laid Him, and I will take Him away.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	20	16	Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; She turned and said to Him in Hebrew, &ldquo;Rabboni!&rdquo; (which means, Teacher).	43
NASB	John	20	17	Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Stop clinging to Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brethren and say to them, &lsquo;I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.&rsquo;&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	20	18	Mary Magdalene came, announcing to the disciples, &ldquo;I have seen the Lord,&rdquo; and that He had said these things to her.	43
NASB	John	20	19	So when it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst and said to them, &ldquo;Peace be with you.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	20	2	So she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, &ldquo;They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	20	20	And when He had said this, He showed them both His hands and His side. The disciples then rejoiced when they saw the Lord.	43
NASB	John	20	21	So Jesus said to them again, &ldquo;Peace be with you; as the Father has sent Me, I also send you.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	20	22	And when He had said this, He breathed on them and said to them, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit.	43
NASB	John	20	23	&ldquo;If you forgive the sins of any, their sins have been forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they have been retained.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	20	24	But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.	43
NASB	John	20	25	So the other disciples were saying to him, &ldquo;We have seen the Lord!&rdquo; But he said to them, &ldquo;Unless I see in His hands the imprint of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	20	26	After eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors having been shut, and stood in their midst and said, &ldquo;Peace be with you.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	20	27	Then He said to Thomas, &ldquo;Reach here with your finger, and see My hands; and reach here your hand and put it into My side; and do not be unbelieving, but believing.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	20	28	Thomas answered and said to Him, &ldquo;My Lord and my God!&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	20	29	Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Because you have seen Me, have you believed? Blessed are they who did not see, and yet believed.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	20	3	So Peter and the other disciple went forth, and they were going to the tomb.	43
NASB	John	20	30	Therefore many other signs Jesus also performed in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book;	43
NASB	John	20	31	But these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you may have life in His name.	43
NASB	John	20	4	The two were running together; and the other disciple ran ahead faster than Peter and came to the tomb first;	43
NASB	John	20	5	And stooping and looking in, he saw the linen wrappings lying there; but he did not go in.	43
NASB	John	20	6	And so Simon Peter also came, following him, and entered the tomb; and he saw the linen wrappings lying there,	43
NASB	John	20	7	And the face-cloth which had been on His head, not lying with the linen wrappings, but rolled up in a place by itself.	43
NASB	John	20	8	So the other disciple who had first come to the tomb then also entered, and he saw and believed.	43
NASB	John	20	9	For as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that He must rise again from the dead.	43
NASB	John	21	1	After these things Jesus manifested Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and He manifested Himself in this way.	43
NASB	John	21	10	Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Bring some of the fish which you have now caught.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	21	11	Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land, full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not torn.	43
NASB	John	21	12	Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Come and have breakfast.&rdquo; None of the disciples ventured to question Him, &ldquo;Who are You?&rdquo; knowing that it was the Lord.	43
NASB	John	21	13	Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish likewise.	43
NASB	John	21	14	This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after He was raised from the dead.	43
NASB	John	21	15	So when they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, &ldquo;Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?&rdquo; He said to Him, &ldquo;Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.&rdquo; He said to him, &ldquo;Tend My lambs.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	21	16	He said to him again a second time, &ldquo;Simon, son of John, do you love Me?&rdquo; He said to Him, &ldquo;Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.&rdquo; He said to him, &ldquo;Shepherd My sheep.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	21	17	He said to him the third time, &ldquo;Simon, son of John, do you love Me?&rdquo; Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, &ldquo;Do you love Me?&rdquo; And he said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You.&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Tend My sheep.	43
NASB	John	21	18	&ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you used to gird yourself and walk wherever you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands and someone else will gird you, and bring you where you do not wish to go.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	21	19	Now this He said, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He said to him, &ldquo;Follow Me!&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	21	2	Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together.	43
NASB	John	21	20	Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them; the one who also had leaned back on His bosom at the supper and said, &ldquo;Lord, who is the one who betrays You?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	21	21	So Peter seeing him said to Jesus, &ldquo;Lord, and what about this man?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	21	22	Jesus said to him, &ldquo;If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me!&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	21	23	Therefore this saying went out among the brethren that that disciple would not die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but only, &ldquo;If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	21	24	This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and wrote these things, and we know that his testimony is true.	43
NASB	John	21	25	And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they were written in detail, I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that would be written.	43
NASB	John	21	3	Simon Peter said to them, &ldquo;I am going fishing.&rdquo; They said to him, &ldquo;We will also come with you.&rdquo; They went out and got into the boat; and that night they caught nothing.	43
NASB	John	21	4	But when the day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.	43
NASB	John	21	5	So Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Children, you do not have any fish, do you?&rdquo; They answered Him, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	21	6	And He said to them, &ldquo;Cast the net on the right-hand side of the boat and you will find a catch.&rdquo; So they cast, and then they were not able to haul it in because of the great number of fish.	43
NASB	John	21	7	Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, &ldquo;It is the Lord.&rdquo; So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put his outer garment on (for he was stripped for work), and threw himself into the sea.	43
NASB	John	21	8	But the other disciples came in the little boat, for they were not far from the land, but about one hundred yards away, dragging the net full of fish.	43
NASB	John	21	9	So when they got out on the land, they saw a charcoal fire already laid and fish placed on it, and bread.	43
NASB	John	3	1	Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews;	43
NASB	John	3	10	Jesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;Are you the teacher of Israel and do not understand these things?	43
NASB	John	3	11	&ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know and testify of what we have seen, and you do not accept our testimony.	43
NASB	John	3	12	&ldquo;If I told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?	43
NASB	John	3	13	&ldquo;No one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended from heaven: the Son of Man.	43
NASB	John	3	14	&ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up;	43
NASB	John	3	15	So that whoever believes will in Him have eternal life.	43
NASB	John	3	16	&ldquo;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.	43
NASB	John	3	17	&ldquo;For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.	43
NASB	John	3	18	&ldquo;He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.	43
NASB	John	3	19	&ldquo;This is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil.	43
NASB	John	3	2	This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, &ldquo;Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	3	20	&ldquo;For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed.	43
NASB	John	3	21	&ldquo;But he who practices the truth comes to the Light, so that his deeds may be manifested as having been wrought in God.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	3	22	After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He was spending time with them and baptizing.	43
NASB	John	3	23	John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and people were coming and were being baptized&mdash;	43
NASB	John	3	24	For John had not yet been thrown into prison.	43
NASB	John	3	25	Therefore there arose a discussion on the part of John&rsquo;s disciples with a Jew about purification.	43
NASB	John	3	26	And they came to John and said to him, &ldquo;Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	3	27	John answered and said, &ldquo;A man can receive nothing unless it has been given him from heaven.	43
NASB	John	3	28	&ldquo;You yourselves are my witnesses that I said, &lsquo;I am not the Christ,&rsquo; but, &lsquo;I have been sent ahead of Him.&rsquo;	43
NASB	John	3	29	&ldquo;He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom&rsquo;s voice. So this joy of mine has been made full.	43
NASB	John	3	3	Jesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	3	30	&ldquo;He must increase, but I must decrease.	43
NASB	John	3	31	&ldquo;He who comes from above is above all, he who is of the earth is from the earth and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.	43
NASB	John	3	32	&ldquo;What He has seen and heard, of that He testifies; and no one receives His testimony.	43
NASB	John	3	33	&ldquo;He who has received His testimony has set his seal to this, that God is true.	43
NASB	John	3	34	&ldquo;For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for He gives the Spirit without measure.	43
NASB	John	3	35	&ldquo;The Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hand.	43
NASB	John	3	36	&ldquo;He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	3	4	Nicodemus said to Him, &ldquo;How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born, can he?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	3	5	Jesus answered, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.	43
NASB	John	3	6	&ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.	43
NASB	John	3	7	&ldquo;Do not be amazed that I said to you, &lsquo;You must be born again.&rsquo;	43
NASB	John	3	8	&ldquo;The wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	3	9	Nicodemus said to Him, &ldquo;How can these things be?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	4	1	Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John	43
NASB	John	4	10	Jesus answered and said to her, &ldquo;If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, &lsquo;Give Me a drink,&rsquo; you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	4	11	She said to Him, &ldquo;Sir, You have nothing to draw with and the well is deep; where then do You get that living water?	43
NASB	John	4	12	&ldquo;You are not greater than our father Jacob, are You, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself and his sons and his cattle?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	4	13	Jesus answered and said to her, &ldquo;Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again;	43
NASB	John	4	14	But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never thirst; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	4	15	The woman said to Him, &ldquo;Sir, give me this water, so I will not be thirsty nor come all the way here to draw.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	4	16	He said to her, &ldquo;Go, call your husband and come here.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	4	17	The woman answered and said, &ldquo;I have no husband.&rdquo; Jesus said to her, &ldquo;You have correctly said, &lsquo;I have no husband&rsquo;;	43
NASB	John	4	18	For you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	4	19	The woman said to Him, &ldquo;Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.	43
NASB	John	4	2	(although Jesus Himself was not baptizing, but His disciples were),	43
NASB	John	4	20	&ldquo;Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you people say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	4	21	Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.	43
NASB	John	4	22	&ldquo;You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.	43
NASB	John	4	23	&ldquo;But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers.	43
NASB	John	4	24	&ldquo;God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	4	25	The woman said to Him, &ldquo;I know that Messiah is coming (He who is called Christ); when that One comes, He will declare all things to us.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	4	26	Jesus said to her, &ldquo;I who speak to you am He.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	4	27	At this point His disciples came, and they were amazed that He had been speaking with a woman, yet no one said, &ldquo;What do You seek?&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Why do You speak with her?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	4	28	So the woman left her waterpot, and went into the city and said to the men,	43
NASB	John	4	29	&ldquo;Come, see a man who told me all the things that I have done; this is not the Christ, is it?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	4	3	He left Judea and went away again into Galilee.	43
NASB	John	4	30	They went out of the city, and were coming to Him.	43
NASB	John	4	31	Meanwhile the disciples were urging Him, saying, &ldquo;Rabbi, eat.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	4	32	But He said to them, &ldquo;I have food to eat that you do not know about.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	4	33	So the disciples were saying to one another, &ldquo;No one brought Him anything to eat, did he?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	4	34	Jesus said to them, &ldquo;My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to accomplish His work.	43
NASB	John	4	35	&ldquo;Do you not say, &lsquo;There are yet four months, and then comes the harvest&rsquo;? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look on the fields, that they are white for harvest.	43
NASB	John	4	36	&ldquo;Already he who reaps is receiving wages and is gathering fruit for life eternal; so that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.	43
NASB	John	4	37	&ldquo;For in this case the saying is true, &lsquo;One sows and another reaps.&rsquo;	43
NASB	John	4	38	&ldquo;I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored and you have entered into their labor.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	4	39	From that city many of the Samaritans believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified, &ldquo;He told me all the things that I have done.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	4	4	And He had to pass through Samaria.	43
NASB	John	4	40	So when the Samaritans came to Jesus, they were asking Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days.	43
NASB	John	4	41	Many more believed because of His word;	43
NASB	John	4	42	And they were saying to the woman, &ldquo;It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves and know that this One is indeed the Savior of the world.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	4	43	After the two days He went forth from there into Galilee.	43
NASB	John	4	44	For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.	43
NASB	John	4	45	So when He came to Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all the things that He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they themselves also went to the feast.	43
NASB	John	4	46	Therefore He came again to Cana of Galilee where He had made the water wine. And there was a royal official whose son was sick at Capernaum.	43
NASB	John	4	47	When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and was imploring Him to come down and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.	43
NASB	John	4	48	So Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Unless you people see signs and wonders, you simply will not believe.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	4	49	The royal official said to Him, &ldquo;Sir, come down before my child dies.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	4	5	So He came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph;	43
NASB	John	4	50	Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Go; your son lives.&rdquo; The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and started off.	43
NASB	John	4	51	As he was now going down, his slaves met him, saying that his son was living.	43
NASB	John	4	52	So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. Then they said to him, &ldquo;Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	4	53	So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Your son lives&rdquo;; and he himself believed and his whole household.	43
NASB	John	4	54	This is again a second sign that Jesus performed when He had come out of Judea into Galilee.	43
NASB	John	4	6	And Jacob&rsquo;s well was there. So Jesus, being wearied from His journey, was sitting thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.	43
NASB	John	4	7	There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Give Me a drink.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	4	8	For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.	43
NASB	John	4	9	Therefore the Samaritan woman said to Him, &ldquo;How is it that You, being a Jew, ask me for a drink since I am a Samaritan woman?&rdquo; (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)	43
NASB	John	5	1	After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.	43
NASB	John	5	10	So the Jews were saying to the man who was cured, &ldquo;It is the Sabbath, and it is not permissible for you to carry your pallet.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	5	11	But he answered them, &ldquo;He who made me well was the one who said to me, &lsquo;Pick up your pallet and walk.&rsquo;&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	5	12	They asked him, &ldquo;Who is the man who said to you, &lsquo;Pick up your pallet and walk&rsquo;?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	5	13	But the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away while there was a crowd in that place.	43
NASB	John	5	14	Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, &ldquo;Behold, you have become well; do not sin anymore, so that nothing worse happens to you.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	5	15	The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.	43
NASB	John	5	16	For this reason the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath.	43
NASB	John	5	17	But He answered them, &ldquo;My Father is working until now, and I Myself am working.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	5	18	For this reason therefore the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.	43
NASB	John	5	19	Therefore Jesus answered and was saying to them, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, unless it is something He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, these things the Son also does in like manner.	43
NASB	John	5	2	Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porticoes.	43
NASB	John	5	20	&ldquo;For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing; and the Father will show Him greater works than these, so that you will marvel.	43
NASB	John	5	21	&ldquo;For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes.	43
NASB	John	5	22	&ldquo;For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son,	43
NASB	John	5	23	So that all will honor the Son even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.	43
NASB	John	5	24	&ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.	43
NASB	John	5	25	&ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.	43
NASB	John	5	26	&ldquo;For just as the Father has life in Himself, even so He gave to the Son also to have life in Himself;	43
NASB	John	5	27	And He gave Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man.	43
NASB	John	5	28	&ldquo;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,	43
NASB	John	5	29	And will come forth; those who did the good deeds to a resurrection of life, those who committed the evil deeds to a resurrection of judgment.	43
NASB	John	5	3	In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered, [waiting for the moving of the waters;	43
NASB	John	5	30	&ldquo;I can do nothing on My own initiative. As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.	43
NASB	John	5	31	&ldquo;If I alone testify about Myself, My testimony is not true.	43
NASB	John	5	32	&ldquo;There is another who testifies of Me, and I know that the testimony which He gives about Me is true.	43
NASB	John	5	33	&ldquo;You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.	43
NASB	John	5	34	&ldquo;But the testimony which I receive is not from man, but I say these things so that you may be saved.	43
NASB	John	5	35	&ldquo;He was the lamp that was burning and was shining and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.	43
NASB	John	5	36	&ldquo;But the testimony which I have is greater than the testimony of John; for the works which the Father has given Me to accomplish&mdash;the very works that I do&mdash;testify about Me, that the Father has sent Me.	43
NASB	John	5	37	&ldquo;And the Father who sent Me, He has testified of Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time nor seen His form.	43
NASB	John	5	38	&ldquo;You do not have His word abiding in you, for you do not believe Him whom He sent.	43
NASB	John	5	39	&ldquo;You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me;	43
NASB	John	5	4	For an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool and stirred up the water; whoever then first, after the stirring up of the water, stepped in was made well from whatever disease with which he was afflicted.]	43
NASB	John	5	40	And you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life.	43
NASB	John	5	41	&ldquo;I do not receive glory from men;	43
NASB	John	5	42	But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.	43
NASB	John	5	43	&ldquo;I have come in My Father&rsquo;s name, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him.	43
NASB	John	5	44	&ldquo;How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and you do not seek the glory that is from the one and only God?	43
NASB	John	5	45	&ldquo;Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; the one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have set your hope.	43
NASB	John	5	46	&ldquo;For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me, for he wrote about Me.	43
NASB	John	5	47	&ldquo;But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	5	5	A man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years.	43
NASB	John	5	6	When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had already been a long time in that condition, He said to him, &ldquo;Do you wish to get well?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	5	7	The sick man answered Him, &ldquo;Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I am coming, another steps down before me.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	5	8	Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Get up, pick up your pallet and walk.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	5	9	Immediately the man became well, and picked up his pallet and began to walk. Now it was the Sabbath on that day.	43
NASB	John	6	1	After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (or Tiberias).	43
NASB	John	6	10	Jesus said, &ldquo;Have the people sit down.&rdquo; Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.	43
NASB	John	6	11	Jesus then took the loaves, and having given thanks, He distributed to those who were seated; likewise also of the fish as much as they wanted.	43
NASB	John	6	12	When they were filled, He said to His disciples, &ldquo;Gather up the leftover fragments so that nothing will be lost.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	6	13	So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten.	43
NASB	John	6	14	Therefore when the people saw the sign which He had performed, they said, &ldquo;This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	6	15	So Jesus, perceiving that they were intending to come and take Him by force to make Him king, withdrew again to the mountain by Himself alone.	43
NASB	John	6	16	Now when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,	43
NASB	John	6	17	And after getting into a boat, they started to cross the sea to Capernaum. It had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.	43
NASB	John	6	18	The sea began to be stirred up because a strong wind was blowing.	43
NASB	John	6	19	Then, when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat; and they were frightened.	43
NASB	John	6	2	A large crowd followed Him, because they saw the signs which He was performing on those who were sick.	43
NASB	John	6	20	But He said to them, &ldquo;It is I; do not be afraid.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	6	21	So they were willing to receive Him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.	43
NASB	John	6	22	The next day the crowd that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other small boat there, except one, and that Jesus had not entered with His disciples into the boat, but that His disciples had gone away alone.	43
NASB	John	6	23	There came other small boats from Tiberias near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.	43
NASB	John	6	24	So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they themselves got into the small boats, and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus.	43
NASB	John	6	25	When they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, &ldquo;Rabbi, when did You get here?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	6	26	Jesus answered them and said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled.	43
NASB	John	6	27	&ldquo;Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you, for on Him the Father, God, has set His seal.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	6	28	Therefore they said to Him, &ldquo;What shall we do, so that we may work the works of God?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	6	29	Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	6	3	Then Jesus went up on the mountain, and there He sat down with His disciples.	43
NASB	John	6	30	So they said to Him, &ldquo;What then do You do for a sign, so that we may see, and believe You? What work do You perform?	43
NASB	John	6	31	&ldquo;Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, &lsquo;HE GAVE THEM BREAD OUT OF HEAVEN TO EAT.&rsquo;&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	6	32	Jesus then said to them, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread out of heaven, but it is My Father who gives you the true bread out of heaven.	43
NASB	John	6	33	&ldquo;For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	6	34	Then they said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, always give us this bread.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	6	35	Jesus said to them, &ldquo;I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me will not hunger, and he who believes in Me will never thirst.	43
NASB	John	6	36	&ldquo;But I said to you that you have seen Me, and yet do not believe.	43
NASB	John	6	37	&ldquo;All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will certainly not cast out.	43
NASB	John	6	38	&ldquo;For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.	43
NASB	John	6	39	&ldquo;This is the will of Him who sent Me, that of all that He has given Me I lose nothing, but raise it up on the last day.	43
NASB	John	6	4	Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.	43
NASB	John	6	40	&ldquo;For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who beholds the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	6	41	Therefore the Jews were grumbling about Him, because He said, &ldquo;I am the bread that came down out of heaven.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	6	42	They were saying, &ldquo;Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does He now say, &lsquo;I have come down out of heaven&rsquo;?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	6	43	Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Do not grumble among yourselves.	43
NASB	John	6	44	&ldquo;No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up on the last day.	43
NASB	John	6	45	&ldquo;It is written in the prophets, &lsquo;AND THEY SHALL ALL BE TAUGHT OF GOD.&rsquo; Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father, comes to Me.	43
NASB	John	6	46	&ldquo;Not that anyone has seen the Father, except the One who is from God; He has seen the Father.	43
NASB	John	6	47	&ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life.	43
NASB	John	6	48	&ldquo;I am the bread of life.	43
NASB	John	6	49	&ldquo;Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.	43
NASB	John	6	5	Therefore Jesus, lifting up His eyes and seeing that a large crowd was coming to Him, said to Philip, &ldquo;Where are we to buy bread, so that these may eat?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	6	50	&ldquo;This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die.	43
NASB	John	6	51	&ldquo;I am the living bread that came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread also which I will give for the life of the world is My flesh.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	6	52	Then the Jews began to argue with one another, saying, &ldquo;How can this man give us His flesh to eat?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	6	53	So Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves.	43
NASB	John	6	54	&ldquo;He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.	43
NASB	John	6	55	&ldquo;For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink.	43
NASB	John	6	56	&ldquo;He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him.	43
NASB	John	6	57	&ldquo;As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also will live because of Me.	43
NASB	John	6	58	&ldquo;This is the bread which came down out of heaven; not as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread will live forever.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	6	59	These things He said in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum.	43
NASB	John	6	6	This He was saying to test him, for He Himself knew what He was intending to do.	43
NASB	John	6	60	Therefore many of His disciples, when they heard this said, &ldquo;This is a difficult statement; who can listen to it?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	6	61	But Jesus, conscious that His disciples grumbled at this, said to them, &ldquo;Does this cause you to stumble?	43
NASB	John	6	62	&ldquo;What then if you see the Son of Man ascending to where He was before?	43
NASB	John	6	63	&ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.	43
NASB	John	6	64	&ldquo;But there are some of you who do not believe.&rdquo; For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was that would betray Him.	43
NASB	John	6	65	And He was saying, &ldquo;For this reason I have said to you, that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted him from the Father.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	6	66	As a result of this many of His disciples withdrew and were not walking with Him anymore.	43
NASB	John	6	67	So Jesus said to the twelve, &ldquo;You do not want to go away also, do you?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	6	68	Simon Peter answered Him, &ldquo;Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life.	43
NASB	John	6	69	&ldquo;We have believed and have come to know that You are the Holy One of God.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	6	7	Philip answered Him, &ldquo;Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, for everyone to receive a little.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	6	70	Jesus answered them, &ldquo;Did I Myself not choose you, the twelve, and yet one of you is a devil?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	6	71	Now He meant Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the twelve, was going to betray Him.	43
NASB	John	6	8	One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter&rsquo;s brother, said to Him,	43
NASB	John	6	9	&ldquo;There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these for so many people?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	7	1	After these things Jesus was walking in Galilee, for He was unwilling to walk in Judea because the Jews were seeking to kill Him.	43
NASB	John	7	10	But when His brothers had gone up to the feast, then He Himself also went up, not publicly, but as if, in secret.	43
NASB	John	7	11	So the Jews were seeking Him at the feast and were saying, &ldquo;Where is He?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	7	12	There was much grumbling among the crowds concerning Him; some were saying, &ldquo;He is a good man&rdquo;; others were saying, &ldquo;No, on the contrary, He leads the people astray.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	7	13	Yet no one was speaking openly of Him for fear of the Jews.	43
NASB	John	7	14	But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and began to teach.	43
NASB	John	7	15	The Jews then were astonished, saying, &ldquo;How has this man become learned, having never been educated?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	7	16	So Jesus answered them and said, &ldquo;My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me.	43
NASB	John	7	17	&ldquo;If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know of the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself.	43
NASB	John	7	18	&ldquo;He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who is seeking the glory of the One who sent Him, He is true, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.	43
NASB	John	7	19	&ldquo;Did not Moses give you the Law, and yet none of you carries out the Law? Why do you seek to kill Me?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	7	2	Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was near.	43
NASB	John	7	20	The crowd answered, &ldquo;You have a demon! Who seeks to kill You?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	7	21	Jesus answered them, &ldquo;I did one deed, and you all marvel.	43
NASB	John	7	22	&ldquo;For this reason Moses has given you circumcision (not because it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a man.	43
NASB	John	7	23	&ldquo;If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the Law of Moses will not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made an entire man well on the Sabbath?	43
NASB	John	7	24	&ldquo;Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	7	25	So some of the people of Jerusalem were saying, &ldquo;Is this not the man whom they are seeking to kill?	43
NASB	John	7	26	&ldquo;Look, He is speaking publicly, and they are saying nothing to Him. The rulers do not really know that this is the Christ, do they?	43
NASB	John	7	27	&ldquo;However, we know where this man is from; but whenever the Christ may come, no one knows where He is from.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	7	28	Then Jesus cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, &ldquo;You both know Me and know where I am from; and I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.	43
NASB	John	7	29	&ldquo;I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	7	3	Therefore His brothers said to Him, &ldquo;Leave here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples also may see Your works which You are doing.	43
NASB	John	7	30	So they were seeking to seize Him; and no man laid his hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.	43
NASB	John	7	31	But many of the crowd believed in Him; and they were saying, &ldquo;When the Christ comes, He will not perform more signs than those which this man has, will He?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	7	32	The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about Him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to seize Him.	43
NASB	John	7	33	Therefore Jesus said, &ldquo;For a little while longer I am with you, then I go to Him who sent Me.	43
NASB	John	7	34	&ldquo;You will seek Me, and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	7	35	The Jews then said to one another, &ldquo;Where does this man intend to go that we will not find Him? He is not intending to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks, is He?	43
NASB	John	7	36	&ldquo;What is this statement that He said, &lsquo;You will seek Me, and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come&rsquo;?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	7	37	Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, &ldquo;If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink.	43
NASB	John	7	38	&ldquo;He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, &lsquo;From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.&rsquo;&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	7	39	But this He spoke of the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.	43
NASB	John	7	4	&ldquo;For no one does anything in secret when he himself seeks to be known publicly. If You do these things, show Yourself to the world.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	7	40	Some of the people therefore, when they heard these words, were saying, &ldquo;This certainly is the Prophet.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	7	41	Others were saying, &ldquo;This is the Christ.&rdquo; Still others were saying, &ldquo;Surely the Christ is not going to come from Galilee, is He?	43
NASB	John	7	42	&ldquo;Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	7	43	So a division occurred in the crowd because of Him.	43
NASB	John	7	44	Some of them wanted to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him.	43
NASB	John	7	45	The officers then came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, &ldquo;Why did you not bring Him?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	7	46	The officers answered, &ldquo;Never has a man spoken the way this man speaks.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	7	47	The Pharisees then answered them, &ldquo;You have not also been led astray, have you?	43
NASB	John	7	48	&ldquo;No one of the rulers or Pharisees has believed in Him, has he?	43
NASB	John	7	49	&ldquo;But this crowd which does not know the Law is accursed.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	7	5	For not even His brothers were believing in Him.	43
NASB	John	7	50	Nicodemus (he who came to Him before, being one of them) said to them,	43
NASB	John	7	51	&ldquo;Our Law does not judge a man unless it first hears from him and knows what he is doing, does it?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	7	52	They answered him, &ldquo;You are not also from Galilee, are you? Search, and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	7	53	[Everyone went to his home.	43
NASB	John	7	6	So Jesus said to them, &ldquo;My time is not yet here, but your time is always opportune.	43
NASB	John	7	7	&ldquo;The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me because I testify of it, that its deeds are evil.	43
NASB	John	7	8	&ldquo;Go up to the feast yourselves; I do not go up to this feast because My time has not yet fully come.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	7	9	Having said these things to them, He stayed in Galilee.	43
NASB	John	8	1	But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.	43
NASB	John	8	10	Straightening up, Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	8	11	She said, &ldquo;No one, Lord.&rdquo; And Jesus said, &ldquo;I do not condemn you, either. Go. From now on sin no more.&rdquo;]	43
NASB	John	8	12	Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, &ldquo;I am the Light of the world; he who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	8	13	So the Pharisees said to Him, &ldquo;You are testifying about Yourself; Your testimony is not true.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	8	14	Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Even if I testify about Myself, My testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going.	43
NASB	John	8	15	&ldquo;You judge according to the flesh; I am not judging anyone.	43
NASB	John	8	16	&ldquo;But even if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone in it, but I and the Father who sent Me.	43
NASB	John	8	17	&ldquo;Even in your law it has been written that the testimony of two men is true.	43
NASB	John	8	18	&ldquo;I am He who testifies about Myself, and the Father who sent Me testifies about Me.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	8	19	So they were saying to Him, &ldquo;Where is Your Father?&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo;You know neither Me nor My Father; if you knew Me, you would know My Father also.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	8	2	Early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people were coming to Him; and He sat down and began to teach them.	43
NASB	John	8	20	These words He spoke in the treasury, as He taught in the temple; and no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come.	43
NASB	John	8	21	Then He said again to them, &ldquo;I go away, and you will seek Me, and will die in your sin; where I am going, you cannot come.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	8	22	So the Jews were saying, &ldquo;Surely He will not kill Himself, will He, since He says, &lsquo;Where I am going, you cannot come&rsquo;?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	8	23	And He was saying to them, &ldquo;You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.	43
NASB	John	8	24	&ldquo;Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	8	25	So they were saying to Him, &ldquo;Who are You?&rdquo; Jesus said to them, &ldquo;What have I been saying to you from the beginning?	43
NASB	John	8	26	&ldquo;I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you, but He who sent Me is true; and the things which I heard from Him, these I speak to the world.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	8	27	They did not realize that He had been speaking to them about the Father.	43
NASB	John	8	28	So Jesus said, &ldquo;When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and I do nothing on My own initiative, but I speak these things as the Father taught Me.	43
NASB	John	8	29	&ldquo;And He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	8	3	The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery, and having set her in the center of the court,	43
NASB	John	8	30	As He spoke these things, many came to believe in Him.	43
NASB	John	8	31	So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, &ldquo;If you continue in My word, then you are truly disciples of Mine;	43
NASB	John	8	32	And you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	8	33	They answered Him, &ldquo;We are Abraham&rsquo;s descendants and have never yet been enslaved to anyone; how is it that You say, &lsquo;You will become free&rsquo;?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	8	34	Jesus answered them, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin.	43
NASB	John	8	35	&ldquo;The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son does remain forever.	43
NASB	John	8	36	&ldquo;So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.	43
NASB	John	8	37	&ldquo;I know that you are Abraham&rsquo;s descendants; yet you seek to kill Me, because My word has no place in you.	43
NASB	John	8	38	&ldquo;I speak the things which I have seen with My Father; therefore you also do the things which you heard from your father.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	8	39	They answered and said to Him, &ldquo;Abraham is our father.&rdquo; Jesus said to them, &ldquo;If you are Abraham&rsquo;s children, do the deeds of Abraham.	43
NASB	John	8	4	They said to Him, &ldquo;Teacher, this woman has been caught in adultery, in the very act.	43
NASB	John	8	40	&ldquo;But as it is, you are seeking to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God; this Abraham did not do.	43
NASB	John	8	41	&ldquo;You are doing the deeds of your father.&rdquo; They said to Him, &ldquo;We were not born of fornication; we have one Father: God.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	8	42	Jesus said to them, &ldquo;If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and have come from God, for I have not even come on My own initiative, but He sent Me.	43
NASB	John	8	43	&ldquo;Why do you not understand what I am saying? It is because you cannot hear My word.	43
NASB	John	8	44	&ldquo;You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.	43
NASB	John	8	45	&ldquo;But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me.	43
NASB	John	8	46	&ldquo;Which one of you convicts Me of sin? If I speak truth, why do you not believe Me?	43
NASB	John	8	47	&ldquo;He who is of God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not hear them, because you are not of God.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	8	48	The Jews answered and said to Him, &ldquo;Do we not say rightly that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	8	49	Jesus answered, &ldquo;I do not have a demon; but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.	43
NASB	John	8	5	&ldquo;Now in the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women; what then do You say?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	8	50	&ldquo;But I do not seek My glory; there is One who seeks and judges.	43
NASB	John	8	51	&ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps My word he will never see death.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	8	52	The Jews said to Him, &ldquo;Now we know that You have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets also; and You say, &lsquo;If anyone keeps My word, he will never taste of death.&rsquo;	43
NASB	John	8	53	&ldquo;Surely You are not greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets died too; whom do You make Yourself out to be?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	8	54	Jesus answered, &ldquo;If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say, &lsquo;He is our God&rsquo;;	43
NASB	John	8	55	And you have not come to know Him, but I know Him; and if I say that I do not know Him, I will be a liar like you, but I do know Him and keep His word.	43
NASB	John	8	56	&ldquo;Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	8	57	So the Jews said to Him, &ldquo;You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	8	58	Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	8	59	Therefore they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple.	43
NASB	John	8	6	They were saying this, testing Him, so that they might have grounds for accusing Him. But Jesus stooped down and with His finger wrote on the ground.	43
NASB	John	8	7	But when they persisted in asking Him, He straightened up, and said to them, &ldquo;He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	8	8	Again He stooped down and wrote on the ground.	43
NASB	John	8	9	When they heard it, they began to go out one by one, beginning with the older ones, and He was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the center of the court.	43
NASB	John	9	1	As He passed by, He saw a man blind from birth.	43
NASB	John	9	10	So they were saying to him, &ldquo;How then were your eyes opened?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	9	11	He answered, &ldquo;The man who is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, &lsquo;Go to Siloam and wash&rsquo;; so I went away and washed, and I received sight.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	9	12	They said to him, &ldquo;Where is He?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	9	13	They brought to the Pharisees the man who was formerly blind.	43
NASB	John	9	14	Now it was a Sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.	43
NASB	John	9	15	Then the Pharisees also were asking him again how he received his sight. And he said to them, &ldquo;He applied clay to my eyes, and I washed, and I see.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	9	16	Therefore some of the Pharisees were saying, &ldquo;This man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath.&rdquo; But others were saying, &ldquo;How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?&rdquo; And there was a division among them.	43
NASB	John	9	17	So they said to the blind man again, &ldquo;What do you say about Him, since He opened your eyes?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;He is a prophet.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	9	18	The Jews then did not believe it of him, that he had been blind and had received sight, until they called the parents of the very one who had received his sight,	43
NASB	John	9	19	And questioned them, saying, &ldquo;Is this your son, who you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	9	2	And His disciples asked Him, &ldquo;Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born blind?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	9	20	His parents answered them and said, &ldquo;We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;	43
NASB	John	9	21	But how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him; he is of age, he will speak for himself.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	9	22	His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed Him to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue.	43
NASB	John	9	23	For this reason his parents said, &ldquo;He is of age; ask him.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	9	24	So a second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, &ldquo;Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	9	25	He then answered, &ldquo;Whether He is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	9	26	So they said to him, &ldquo;What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	9	27	He answered them, &ldquo;I told you already and you did not listen; why do you want to hear it again? You do not want to become His disciples too, do you?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	9	28	They reviled him and said, &ldquo;You are His disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.	43
NASB	John	9	29	&ldquo;We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where He is from.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	9	3	Jesus answered, &ldquo;It was neither that this man sinned, nor his parents; but it was so that the works of God might be displayed in him.	43
NASB	John	9	30	The man answered and said to them, &ldquo;Well, here is an amazing thing, that you do not know where He is from, and yet He opened my eyes.	43
NASB	John	9	31	&ldquo;We know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is God-fearing and does His will, He hears him.	43
NASB	John	9	32	&ldquo;Since the beginning of time it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind.	43
NASB	John	9	33	&ldquo;If this man were not from God, He could do nothing.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	9	34	They answered him, &ldquo;You were born entirely in sins, and are you teaching us?&rdquo; So they put him out.	43
NASB	John	9	35	Jesus heard that they had put him out, and finding him, He said, &ldquo;Do you believe in the Son of Man?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	9	36	He answered, &ldquo;Who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	9	37	Jesus said to him, &ldquo;You have both seen Him, and He is the one who is talking with you.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	9	38	And he said, &ldquo;Lord, I believe.&rdquo; And he worshiped Him.	43
NASB	John	9	39	And Jesus said, &ldquo;For judgment I came into this world, so that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	9	4	&ldquo;We must work the works of Him who sent Me as long as it is day; night is coming when no one can work.	43
NASB	John	9	40	Those of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him, &ldquo;We are not blind too, are we?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	9	41	Jesus said to them, &ldquo;If you were blind, you would have no sin; but since you say, &lsquo;We see,&rsquo; your sin remains.	43
NASB	John	9	5	&ldquo;While I am in the world, I am the Light of the world.&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	9	6	When He had said this, He spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and applied the clay to his eyes,	43
NASB	John	9	7	And said to him, &ldquo;Go, wash in the pool of Siloam&rdquo; (which is translated, Sent). So he went away and washed, and came back seeing.	43
NASB	John	9	8	Therefore the neighbors, and those who previously saw him as a beggar, were saying, &ldquo;Is not this the one who used to sit and beg?&rdquo;	43
NASB	John	9	9	Others were saying, &ldquo;This is he,&rdquo; still others were saying, &ldquo;No, but he is like him.&rdquo; He kept saying, &ldquo;I am the one.&rdquo;	43
NASB	Jude	1	1	Jude, a bond-servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, To those who are the called, beloved in God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ:	65
NASB	Jude	1	10	But these men revile the things which they do not understand; and the things which they know by instinct, like unreasoning animals, by these things they are destroyed.	65
NASB	Jude	1	11	Woe to them! For they have gone the way of Cain, and for pay they have rushed headlong into the error of Balaam, and perished in the rebellion of Korah.	65
NASB	Jude	1	12	These are the men who are hidden reefs in your love feasts when they feast with you without fear, caring for themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn trees without fruit, doubly dead, uprooted;	65
NASB	Jude	1	13	Wild waves of the sea, casting up their own shame like foam; wandering stars, for whom the black darkness has been reserved forever.	65
NASB	Jude	1	14	It was also about these men that Enoch, in the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied, saying, &ldquo;Behold, the Lord came with many thousands of His holy ones,	65
NASB	Jude	1	15	To execute judgment upon all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their ungodly deeds which they have done in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.&rdquo;	65
NASB	Jude	1	16	These are grumblers, finding fault, following after their own lusts; they speak arrogantly, flattering people for the sake of gaining an advantage.	65
NASB	Jude	1	17	But you, beloved, ought to remember the words that were spoken beforehand by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,	65
NASB	Jude	1	18	That they were saying to you, &ldquo;In the last time there will be mockers, following after their own ungodly lusts.&rdquo;	65
NASB	Jude	1	19	These are the ones who cause divisions, worldly-minded, devoid of the Spirit.	65
NASB	Jude	1	2	May mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you.	65
NASB	Jude	1	20	But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,	65
NASB	Jude	1	21	Keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting anxiously for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life.	65
NASB	Jude	1	22	And have mercy on some, who are doubting;	65
NASB	Jude	1	23	Save others, snatching them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with fear, hating even the garment polluted by the flesh.	65
NASB	Jude	1	24	Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to make you stand in the presence of His glory blameless with great joy,	65
NASB	Jude	1	25	To the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.	65
NASB	Jude	1	3	Beloved, while I was making every effort to write you about our common salvation, I felt the necessity to write to you appealing that you contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all handed down to the saints.	65
NASB	Jude	1	4	For certain persons have crept in unnoticed, those who were long beforehand marked out for this condemnation, ungodly persons who turn the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.	65
NASB	Jude	1	5	Now I desire to remind you, though you know all things once for all, that the Lord, after saving a people out of the land of Egypt, subsequently destroyed those who did not believe.	65
NASB	Jude	1	6	And angels who did not keep their own domain, but abandoned their proper abode, He has kept in eternal bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day,	65
NASB	Jude	1	7	Just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, since they in the same way as these indulged in gross immorality and went after strange flesh, are exhibited as an example in undergoing the punishment of eternal fire.	65
NASB	Jude	1	8	Yet in the same way these men, also by dreaming, defile the flesh, and reject authority, and revile angelic majesties.	65
NASB	Jude	1	9	But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him a railing judgment, but said, &ldquo;The Lord rebuke you!&rdquo;	65
NASB	Luke	1	1	Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile an account of the things accomplished among us,	42
NASB	Luke	1	10	And the whole multitude of the people were in prayer outside at the hour of the incense offering.	42
NASB	Luke	1	11	And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing to the right of the altar of incense.	42
NASB	Luke	1	12	Zacharias was troubled when he saw the angel, and fear gripped him.	42
NASB	Luke	1	13	But the angel said to him, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, Zacharias, for your petition has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will give him the name John.	42
NASB	Luke	1	14	&ldquo;You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.	42
NASB	Luke	1	15	&ldquo;For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; and he will drink no wine or liquor, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit while yet in his mother&rsquo;s womb.	42
NASB	Luke	1	16	&ldquo;And he will turn many of the sons of Israel back to the Lord their God.	42
NASB	Luke	1	17	&ldquo;It is he who will go as a forerunner before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, TO TURN THE HEARTS OF THE FATHERS BACK TO THE CHILDREN, and the disobedient to the attitude of the righteous, so as to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	1	18	Zacharias said to the angel, &ldquo;How will I know this for certain? For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	1	19	The angel answered and said to him, &ldquo;I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.	42
NASB	Luke	1	2	Just as they were handed down to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word,	42
NASB	Luke	1	20	&ldquo;And behold, you shall be silent and unable to speak until the day when these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	1	21	The people were waiting for Zacharias, and were wondering at his delay in the temple.	42
NASB	Luke	1	22	But when he came out, he was unable to speak to them; and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he kept making signs to them, and remained mute.	42
NASB	Luke	1	23	When the days of his priestly service were ended, he went back home.	42
NASB	Luke	1	24	After these days Elizabeth his wife became pregnant, and she kept herself in seclusion for five months, saying,	42
NASB	Luke	1	25	&ldquo;This is the way the Lord has dealt with me in the days when He looked with favor upon me, to take away my disgrace among men.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	1	26	Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth,	42
NASB	Luke	1	27	To a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the descendants of David; and the virgin&rsquo;s name was Mary.	42
NASB	Luke	1	28	And coming in, he said to her, &ldquo;Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	1	29	But she was very perplexed at this statement, and kept pondering what kind of salutation this was.	42
NASB	Luke	1	3	It seemed fitting for me as well, having investigated everything carefully from the beginning, to write it out for you in consecutive order, most excellent Theophilus;	42
NASB	Luke	1	30	The angel said to her, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, Mary; for you have found favor with God.	42
NASB	Luke	1	31	&ldquo;And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name Him Jesus.	42
NASB	Luke	1	32	&ldquo;He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David;	42
NASB	Luke	1	33	And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	1	34	Mary said to the angel, &ldquo;How can this be, since I am a virgin?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	1	35	The angel answered and said to her, &ldquo;The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for that reason the holy Child shall be called the Son of God.	42
NASB	Luke	1	36	&ldquo;And behold, even your relative Elizabeth has also conceived a son in her old age; and she who was called barren is now in her sixth month.	42
NASB	Luke	1	37	&ldquo;For nothing will be impossible with God.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	1	38	And Mary said, &ldquo;Behold, the bondslave of the Lord; may it be done to me according to your word.&rdquo; And the angel departed from her.	42
NASB	Luke	1	39	Now at this time Mary arose and went in a hurry to the hill country, to a city of Judah,	42
NASB	Luke	1	4	So that you may know the exact truth about the things you have been taught.	42
NASB	Luke	1	40	And entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.	42
NASB	Luke	1	41	When Elizabeth heard Mary&rsquo;s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.	42
NASB	Luke	1	42	And she cried out with a loud voice and said, &ldquo;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!	42
NASB	Luke	1	43	&ldquo;And how has it happened to me, that the mother of my Lord would come to me?	42
NASB	Luke	1	44	&ldquo;For behold, when the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy.	42
NASB	Luke	1	45	&ldquo;And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what had been spoken to her by the Lord.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	1	46	And Mary said: &ldquo;My soul exalts the Lord,	42
NASB	Luke	1	47	And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.	42
NASB	Luke	1	48	&ldquo;For He has had regard for the humble state of His bondslave; For behold, from this time on all generations will count me blessed.	42
NASB	Luke	1	49	&ldquo;For the Mighty One has done great things for me; And holy is His name.	42
NASB	Luke	1	5	In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zacharias, of the division of Abijah; and he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.	42
NASB	Luke	1	50	&ldquo;AND HIS MERCY IS UPON GENERATION AFTER GENERATION TOWARD THOSE WHO FEAR HIM.	42
NASB	Luke	1	51	&ldquo;He has done mighty deeds with His arm; He has scattered those who were proud in the thoughts of their heart.	42
NASB	Luke	1	52	&ldquo;He has brought down rulers from their thrones, And has exalted those who were humble.	42
NASB	Luke	1	53	&ldquo;HE HAS FILLED THE HUNGRY WITH GOOD THINGS; And sent away the rich empty-handed.	42
NASB	Luke	1	54	&ldquo;He has given help to Israel His servant, In remembrance of His mercy,	42
NASB	Luke	1	55	As He spoke to our fathers, To Abraham and his descendants forever.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	1	56	And Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned to her home.	42
NASB	Luke	1	57	Now the time had come for Elizabeth to give birth, and she gave birth to a son.	42
NASB	Luke	1	58	Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had displayed His great mercy toward her; and they were rejoicing with her.	42
NASB	Luke	1	59	And it happened that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to call him Zacharias, after his father.	42
NASB	Luke	1	6	They were both righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and requirements of the Lord.	42
NASB	Luke	1	60	But his mother answered and said, &ldquo;No indeed; but he shall be called John.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	1	61	And they said to her, &ldquo;There is no one among your relatives who is called by that name.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	1	62	And they made signs to his father, as to what he wanted him called.	42
NASB	Luke	1	63	And he asked for a tablet and wrote as follows, &ldquo;His name is John.&rdquo; And they were all astonished.	42
NASB	Luke	1	64	And at once his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he began to speak in praise of God.	42
NASB	Luke	1	65	Fear came on all those living around them; and all these matters were being talked about in all the hill country of Judea.	42
NASB	Luke	1	66	All who heard them kept them in mind, saying, &ldquo;What then will this child turn out to be?&rdquo; For the hand of the Lord was certainly with him.	42
NASB	Luke	1	67	And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying:	42
NASB	Luke	1	68	&ldquo;Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, For He has visited us and accomplished redemption for His people,	42
NASB	Luke	1	69	And has raised up a horn of salvation for us In the house of David His servant&mdash;	42
NASB	Luke	1	7	But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in years.	42
NASB	Luke	1	70	As He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from of old&mdash;	42
NASB	Luke	1	71	Salvation FROM OUR ENEMIES, And FROM THE HAND OF ALL WHO HATE US;	42
NASB	Luke	1	72	To show mercy toward our fathers, And to remember His holy covenant,	42
NASB	Luke	1	73	The oath which He swore to Abraham our father,	42
NASB	Luke	1	74	To grant us that we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies, Might serve Him without fear,	42
NASB	Luke	1	75	In holiness and righteousness before Him all our days.	42
NASB	Luke	1	76	&ldquo;And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; For you will go on BEFORE THE LORD TO PREPARE HIS WAYS;	42
NASB	Luke	1	77	To give to His people the knowledge of salvation By the forgiveness of their sins,	42
NASB	Luke	1	78	Because of the tender mercy of our God, With which the Sunrise from on high will visit us,	42
NASB	Luke	1	79	TO SHINE UPON THOSE WHO SIT IN DARKNESS AND THE SHADOW OF DEATH, To guide our feet into the way of peace.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	1	8	Now it happened that while he was performing his priestly service before God in the appointed order of his division,	42
NASB	Luke	1	80	And the child continued to grow and to become strong in spirit, and he lived in the deserts until the day of his public appearance to Israel.	42
NASB	Luke	1	9	According to the custom of the priestly office, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.	42
NASB	Luke	10	1	Now after this the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them in pairs ahead of Him to every city and place where He Himself was going to come.	42
NASB	Luke	10	10	&ldquo;But whatever city you enter and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,	42
NASB	Luke	10	11	&lsquo;Even the dust of your city which clings to our feet we wipe off in protest against you; yet be sure of this, that the kingdom of God has come near.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	10	12	&ldquo;I say to you, it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.	42
NASB	Luke	10	13	&ldquo;Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles had been performed in Tyre and Sidon which occurred in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.	42
NASB	Luke	10	14	&ldquo;But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.	42
NASB	Luke	10	15	&ldquo;And you, Capernaum, will not be exalted to heaven, will you? You will be brought down to Hades!	42
NASB	Luke	10	16	&ldquo;The one who listens to you listens to Me, and the one who rejects you rejects Me; and he who rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	10	17	The seventy returned with joy, saying, &ldquo;Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	10	18	And He said to them, &ldquo;I was watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning.	42
NASB	Luke	10	19	&ldquo;Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will injure you.	42
NASB	Luke	10	2	And He was saying to them, &ldquo;The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.	42
NASB	Luke	10	20	&ldquo;Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	10	21	At that very time He rejoiced greatly in the Holy Spirit, and said, &ldquo;I praise You, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants. Yes, Father, for this way was well-pleasing in Your sight.	42
NASB	Luke	10	22	&ldquo;All things have been handed over to Me by My Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	10	23	Turning to the disciples, He said privately, &ldquo;Blessed are the eyes which see the things you see,	42
NASB	Luke	10	24	For I say to you, that many prophets and kings wished to see the things which you see, and did not see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and did not hear them.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	10	25	And a lawyer stood up and put Him to the test, saying, &ldquo;Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	10	26	And He said to him, &ldquo;What is written in the Law? How does it read to you?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	10	27	And he answered, &ldquo;YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND; AND YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	10	28	And He said to him, &ldquo;You have answered correctly; DO THIS AND YOU WILL LIVE.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	10	29	But wishing to justify himself, he said to Jesus, &ldquo;And who is my neighbor?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	10	3	&ldquo;Go; behold, I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves.	42
NASB	Luke	10	30	Jesus replied and said, &ldquo;A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, and they stripped him and beat him, and went away leaving him half dead.	42
NASB	Luke	10	31	&ldquo;And by chance a priest was going down on that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.	42
NASB	Luke	10	32	&ldquo;Likewise a Levite also, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.	42
NASB	Luke	10	33	&ldquo;But a Samaritan, who was on a journey, came upon him; and when he saw him, he felt compassion,	42
NASB	Luke	10	34	And came to him and bandaged up his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them; and he put him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn and took care of him.	42
NASB	Luke	10	35	&ldquo;On the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said, &lsquo;Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, when I return I will repay you.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	10	36	&ldquo;Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell into the robbers&rsquo; hands?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	10	37	And he said, &ldquo;The one who showed mercy toward him.&rdquo; Then Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Go and do the same.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	10	38	Now as they were traveling along, He entered a village; and a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home.	42
NASB	Luke	10	39	She had a sister called Mary, who was seated at the Lord&rsquo;s feet, listening to His word.	42
NASB	Luke	10	4	&ldquo;Carry no money belt, no bag, no shoes; and greet no one on the way.	42
NASB	Luke	10	40	But Martha was distracted with all her preparations; and she came up to Him and said, &ldquo;Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to do all the serving alone? Then tell her to help me.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	10	41	But the Lord answered and said to her, &ldquo;Martha, Martha, you are worried and bothered about so many things;	42
NASB	Luke	10	42	But only one thing is necessary, for Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	10	5	&ldquo;Whatever house you enter, first say, &lsquo;Peace be to this house.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	10	6	&ldquo;If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you.	42
NASB	Luke	10	7	&ldquo;Stay in that house, eating and drinking what they give you; for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not keep moving from house to house.	42
NASB	Luke	10	8	&ldquo;Whatever city you enter and they receive you, eat what is set before you;	42
NASB	Luke	10	9	And heal those in it who are sick, and say to them, &lsquo;The kingdom of God has come near to you.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	11	1	It happened that while Jesus was praying in a certain place, after He had finished, one of His disciples said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, teach us to pray just as John also taught his disciples.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	11	10	&ldquo;For everyone who asks, receives; and he who seeks, finds; and to him who knocks, it will be opened.	42
NASB	Luke	11	11	&ldquo;Now suppose one of you fathers is asked by his son for a fish; he will not give him a snake instead of a fish, will he?	42
NASB	Luke	11	12	&ldquo;Or if he is asked for an egg, he will not give him a scorpion, will he?	42
NASB	Luke	11	13	&ldquo;If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	11	14	And He was casting out a demon, and it was mute; when the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the crowds were amazed.	42
NASB	Luke	11	15	But some of them said, &ldquo;He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	11	16	Others, to test Him, were demanding of Him a sign from heaven.	42
NASB	Luke	11	17	But He knew their thoughts and said to them, &ldquo;Any kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and a house divided against itself falls.	42
NASB	Luke	11	18	&ldquo;If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.	42
NASB	Luke	11	19	&ldquo;And if I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? So they will be your judges.	42
NASB	Luke	11	2	And He said to them, &ldquo;When you pray, say: &lsquo;Father, hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come.	42
NASB	Luke	11	20	&ldquo;But if I cast out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.	42
NASB	Luke	11	21	&ldquo;When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are undisturbed.	42
NASB	Luke	11	22	&ldquo;But when someone stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him, he takes away from him all his armor on which he had relied and distributes his plunder.	42
NASB	Luke	11	23	&ldquo;He who is not with Me is against Me; and he who does not gather with Me, scatters.	42
NASB	Luke	11	24	&ldquo;When the unclean spirit goes out of a man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and not finding any, it says, &lsquo;I will return to my house from which I came.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	11	25	&ldquo;And when it comes, it finds it swept and put in order.	42
NASB	Luke	11	26	&ldquo;Then it goes and takes along seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	11	27	While Jesus was saying these things, one of the women in the crowd raised her voice and said to Him, &ldquo;Blessed is the womb that bore You and the breasts at which You nursed.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	11	28	But He said, &ldquo;On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God and observe it.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	11	29	As the crowds were increasing, He began to say, &ldquo;This generation is a wicked generation; it seeks for a sign, and yet no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah.	42
NASB	Luke	11	3	&lsquo;Give us each day our daily bread.	42
NASB	Luke	11	30	&ldquo;For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will the Son of Man be to this generation.	42
NASB	Luke	11	31	&ldquo;The Queen of the South will rise up with the men of this generation at the judgment and condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.	42
NASB	Luke	11	32	&ldquo;The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.	42
NASB	Luke	11	33	&ldquo;No one, after lighting a lamp, puts it away in a cellar nor under a basket, but on the lampstand, so that those who enter may see the light.	42
NASB	Luke	11	34	&ldquo;The eye is the lamp of your body; when your eye is clear, your whole body also is full of light; but when it is bad, your body also is full of darkness.	42
NASB	Luke	11	35	&ldquo;Then watch out that the light in you is not darkness.	42
NASB	Luke	11	36	&ldquo;If therefore your whole body is full of light, with no dark part in it, it will be wholly illumined, as when the lamp illumines you with its rays.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	11	37	Now when He had spoken, a Pharisee asked Him to have lunch with him; and He went in, and reclined at the table.	42
NASB	Luke	11	38	When the Pharisee saw it, he was surprised that He had not first ceremonially washed before the meal.	42
NASB	Luke	11	39	But the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the platter; but inside of you, you are full of robbery and wickedness.	42
NASB	Luke	11	4	&lsquo;And forgive us our sins, For we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation.&rsquo;&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	11	40	&ldquo;You foolish ones, did not He who made the outside make the inside also?	42
NASB	Luke	11	41	&ldquo;But give that which is within as charity, and then all things are clean for you.	42
NASB	Luke	11	42	&ldquo;But woe to you Pharisees! For you pay tithe of mint and rue and every kind of garden herb, and yet disregard justice and the love of God; but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others.	42
NASB	Luke	11	43	&ldquo;Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the chief seats in the synagogues and the respectful greetings in the market places.	42
NASB	Luke	11	44	&ldquo;Woe to you! For you are like concealed tombs, and the people who walk over them are unaware of it.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	11	45	One of the lawyers said to Him in reply, &ldquo;Teacher, when You say this, You insult us too.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	11	46	But He said, &ldquo;Woe to you lawyers as well! For you weigh men down with burdens hard to bear, while you yourselves will not even touch the burdens with one of your fingers.	42
NASB	Luke	11	47	&ldquo;Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and it was your fathers who killed them.	42
NASB	Luke	11	48	&ldquo;So you are witnesses and approve the deeds of your fathers; because it was they who killed them, and you build their tombs.	42
NASB	Luke	11	49	&ldquo;For this reason also the wisdom of God said, &lsquo;I will send to them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and some they will persecute,	42
NASB	Luke	11	5	Then He said to them, &ldquo;Suppose one of you has a friend, and goes to him at midnight and says to him, &lsquo;Friend, lend me three loaves;	42
NASB	Luke	11	50	So that the blood of all the prophets, shed since the foundation of the world, may be charged against this generation,	42
NASB	Luke	11	51	From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the house of God; yes, I tell you, it shall be charged against this generation.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	11	52	&ldquo;Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge; you yourselves did not enter, and you hindered those who were entering.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	11	53	When He left there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be very hostile and to question Him closely on many subjects,	42
NASB	Luke	11	54	Plotting against Him to catch Him in something He might say.	42
NASB	Luke	11	6	For a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him&rsquo;;	42
NASB	Luke	11	7	And from inside he answers and says, &lsquo;Do not bother me; the door has already been shut and my children and I are in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	11	8	&ldquo;I tell you, even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs.	42
NASB	Luke	11	9	&ldquo;So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.	42
NASB	Luke	12	1	Under these circumstances, after so many thousands of people had gathered together that they were stepping on one another, He began saying to His disciples first of all, &ldquo;Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.	42
NASB	Luke	12	10	&ldquo;And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him.	42
NASB	Luke	12	11	&ldquo;When they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not worry about how or what you are to speak in your defense, or what you are to say;	42
NASB	Luke	12	12	For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	12	13	Someone in the crowd said to Him, &ldquo;Teacher, tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	12	14	But He said to him, &ldquo;Man, who appointed Me a judge or arbitrator over you?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	12	15	Then He said to them, &ldquo;Beware, and be on your guard against every form of greed; for not even when one has an abundance does his life consist of his possessions.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	12	16	And He told them a parable, saying, &ldquo;The land of a rich man was very productive.	42
NASB	Luke	12	17	&ldquo;And he began reasoning to himself, saying, &lsquo;What shall I do, since I have no place to store my crops?&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	12	18	&ldquo;Then he said, &lsquo;This is what I will do: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.	42
NASB	Luke	12	19	&lsquo;And I will say to my soul, &ldquo;Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years to come; take your ease, eat, drink and be merry.&rsquo;&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	12	2	&ldquo;But there is nothing covered up that will not be revealed, and hidden that will not be known.	42
NASB	Luke	12	20	&ldquo;But God said to him, &lsquo;You fool! This very night your soul is required of you; and now who will own what you have prepared?&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	12	21	&ldquo;So is the man who stores up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	12	22	And He said to His disciples, &ldquo;For this reason I say to you, do not worry about your life, as to what you will eat; nor for your body, as to what you will put on.	42
NASB	Luke	12	23	&ldquo;For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.	42
NASB	Luke	12	24	&ldquo;Consider the ravens, for they neither sow nor reap; they have no storeroom nor barn, and yet God feeds them; how much more valuable you are than the birds!	42
NASB	Luke	12	25	&ldquo;And which of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life&rsquo;s span?	42
NASB	Luke	12	26	&ldquo;If then you cannot do even a very little thing, why do you worry about other matters?	42
NASB	Luke	12	27	&ldquo;Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; but I tell you, not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these.	42
NASB	Luke	12	28	&ldquo;But if God so clothes the grass in the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, how much more will He clothe you? You men of little faith!	42
NASB	Luke	12	29	&ldquo;And do not seek what you will eat and what you will drink, and do not keep worrying.	42
NASB	Luke	12	3	&ldquo;Accordingly, whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in the inner rooms will be proclaimed upon the housetops.	42
NASB	Luke	12	30	&ldquo;For all these things the nations of the world eagerly seek; but your Father knows that you need these things.	42
NASB	Luke	12	31	&ldquo;But seek His kingdom, and these things will be added to you.	42
NASB	Luke	12	32	&ldquo;Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has chosen gladly to give you the kingdom.	42
NASB	Luke	12	33	&ldquo;Sell your possessions and give to charity; make yourselves money belts which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near nor moth destroys.	42
NASB	Luke	12	34	&ldquo;For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.	42
NASB	Luke	12	35	&ldquo;Be dressed in readiness, and keep your lamps lit.	42
NASB	Luke	12	36	&ldquo;Be like men who are waiting for their master when he returns from the wedding feast, so that they may immediately open the door to him when he comes and knocks.	42
NASB	Luke	12	37	&ldquo;Blessed are those slaves whom the master will find on the alert when he comes; truly I say to you, that he will gird himself to serve, and have them recline at the table, and will come up and wait on them.	42
NASB	Luke	12	38	&ldquo;Whether he comes in the second watch, or even in the third, and finds them so, blessed are those slaves.	42
NASB	Luke	12	39	&ldquo;But be sure of this, that if the head of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have allowed his house to be broken into.	42
NASB	Luke	12	4	&ldquo;I say to you, My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that have no more that they can do.	42
NASB	Luke	12	40	&ldquo;You too, be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not expect.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	12	41	Peter said, &ldquo;Lord, are You addressing this parable to us, or to everyone else as well?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	12	42	And the Lord said, &ldquo;Who then is the faithful and sensible steward, whom his master will put in charge of his servants, to give them their rations at the proper time?	42
NASB	Luke	12	43	&ldquo;Blessed is that slave whom his master finds so doing when he comes.	42
NASB	Luke	12	44	&ldquo;Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions.	42
NASB	Luke	12	45	&ldquo;But if that slave says in his heart, &lsquo;My master will be a long time in coming,&rsquo; and begins to beat the slaves, both men and women, and to eat and drink and get drunk;	42
NASB	Luke	12	46	The master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces, and assign him a place with the unbelievers.	42
NASB	Luke	12	47	&ldquo;And that slave who knew his master&rsquo;s will and did not get ready or act in accord with his will, will receive many lashes,	42
NASB	Luke	12	48	But the one who did not know it, and committed deeds worthy of a flogging, will receive but few. From everyone who has been given much, much will be required; and to whom they entrusted much, of him they will ask all the more.	42
NASB	Luke	12	49	&ldquo;I have come to cast fire upon the earth; and how I wish it were already kindled!	42
NASB	Luke	12	5	&ldquo;But I will warn you whom to fear: fear the One who, after He has killed, has authority to cast into hell; yes, I tell you, fear Him!	42
NASB	Luke	12	50	&ldquo;But I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!	42
NASB	Luke	12	51	&ldquo;Do you suppose that I came to grant peace on earth? I tell you, no, but rather division;	42
NASB	Luke	12	52	For from now on five members in one household will be divided, three against two and two against three.	42
NASB	Luke	12	53	&ldquo;They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	12	54	And He was also saying to the crowds, &ldquo;When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, &lsquo;A shower is coming,&rsquo; and so it turns out.	42
NASB	Luke	12	55	&ldquo;And when you see a south wind blowing, you say, &lsquo;It will be a hot day,&rsquo; and it turns out that way.	42
NASB	Luke	12	56	&ldquo;You hypocrites! You know how to analyze the appearance of the earth and the sky, but why do you not analyze this present time?	42
NASB	Luke	12	57	&ldquo;And why do you not even on your own initiative judge what is right?	42
NASB	Luke	12	58	&ldquo;For while you are going with your opponent to appear before the magistrate, on your way there make an effort to settle with him, so that he may not drag you before the judge, and the judge turn you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.	42
NASB	Luke	12	59	&ldquo;I say to you, you will not get out of there until you have paid the very last cent.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	12	6	&ldquo;Are not five sparrows sold for two cents? Yet not one of them is forgotten before God.	42
NASB	Luke	12	7	&ldquo;Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not fear; you are more valuable than many sparrows.	42
NASB	Luke	12	8	&ldquo;And I say to you, everyone who confesses Me before men, the Son of Man will confess him also before the angels of God;	42
NASB	Luke	12	9	But he who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God.	42
NASB	Luke	13	1	Now on the same occasion there were some present who reported to Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.	42
NASB	Luke	13	10	And He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.	42
NASB	Luke	13	11	And there was a woman who for eighteen years had had a sickness caused by a spirit; and she was bent double, and could not straighten up at all.	42
NASB	Luke	13	12	When Jesus saw her, He called her over and said to her, &ldquo;Woman, you are freed from your sickness.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	13	13	And He laid His hands on her; and immediately she was made erect again and began glorifying God.	42
NASB	Luke	13	14	But the synagogue official, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, began saying to the crowd in response, &ldquo;There are six days in which work should be done; so come during them and get healed, and not on the Sabbath day.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	13	15	But the Lord answered him and said, &ldquo;You hypocrites, does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead him away to water him?	42
NASB	Luke	13	16	&ldquo;And this woman, a daughter of Abraham as she is, whom Satan has bound for eighteen long years, should she not have been released from this bond on the Sabbath day?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	13	17	As He said this, all His opponents were being humiliated; and the entire crowd was rejoicing over all the glorious things being done by Him.	42
NASB	Luke	13	18	So He was saying, &ldquo;What is the kingdom of God like, and to what shall I compare it?	42
NASB	Luke	13	19	&ldquo;It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and threw into his own garden; and it grew and became a tree, and THE BIRDS OF THE AIR NESTED IN ITS BRANCHES.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	13	2	And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Do you suppose that these Galileans were greater sinners than all other Galileans because they suffered this fate?	42
NASB	Luke	13	20	And again He said, &ldquo;To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?	42
NASB	Luke	13	21	&ldquo;It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three pecks of flour until it was all leavened.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	13	22	And He was passing through from one city and village to another, teaching, and proceeding on His way to Jerusalem.	42
NASB	Luke	13	23	And someone said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, are there just a few who are being saved?&rdquo; And He said to them,	42
NASB	Luke	13	24	&ldquo;Strive to enter through the narrow door; for many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able.	42
NASB	Luke	13	25	&ldquo;Once the head of the house gets up and shuts the door, and you begin to stand outside and knock on the door, saying, &lsquo;Lord, open up to us!&rsquo; then He will answer and say to you, &lsquo;I do not know where you are from.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	13	26	&ldquo;Then you will begin to say, &lsquo;We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets&rsquo;;	42
NASB	Luke	13	27	And He will say, &lsquo;I tell you, I do not know where you are from; DEPART FROM ME, ALL YOU EVILDOERS.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	13	28	&ldquo;In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but yourselves being thrown out.	42
NASB	Luke	13	29	&ldquo;And they will come from east and west and from north and south, and will recline at the table in the kingdom of God.	42
NASB	Luke	13	3	&ldquo;I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.	42
NASB	Luke	13	30	&ldquo;And behold, some are last who will be first and some are first who will be last.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	13	31	Just at that time some Pharisees approached, saying to Him, &ldquo;Go away, leave here, for Herod wants to kill You.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	13	32	And He said to them, &ldquo;Go and tell that fox, &lsquo;Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I reach My goal.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	13	33	&ldquo;Nevertheless I must journey on today and tomorrow and the next day; for it cannot be that a prophet would perish outside of Jerusalem.	42
NASB	Luke	13	34	&ldquo;O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, just as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not have it!	42
NASB	Luke	13	35	&ldquo;Behold, your house is left to you desolate; and I say to you, you will not see Me until the time comes when you say, &lsquo;BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD!&rsquo;&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	13	4	&ldquo;Or do you suppose that those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them were worse culprits than all the men who live in Jerusalem?	42
NASB	Luke	13	5	&ldquo;I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	13	6	And He began telling this parable: &ldquo;A man had a fig tree which had been planted in his vineyard; and he came looking for fruit on it and did not find any.	42
NASB	Luke	13	7	&ldquo;And he said to the vineyard-keeper, &lsquo;Behold, for three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree without finding any. Cut it down! Why does it even use up the ground?&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	13	8	&ldquo;And he answered and said to him, &lsquo;Let it alone, sir, for this year too, until I dig around it and put in fertilizer;	42
NASB	Luke	13	9	And if it bears fruit next year, fine; but if not, cut it down.&rsquo;&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	14	1	It happened that when He went into the house of one of the leaders of the Pharisees on the Sabbath to eat bread, they were watching Him closely.	42
NASB	Luke	14	10	&ldquo;But when you are invited, go and recline at the last place, so that when the one who has invited you comes, he may say to you, &lsquo;Friend, move up higher&rsquo;; then you will have honor in the sight of all who are at the table with you.	42
NASB	Luke	14	11	&ldquo;For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	14	12	And He also went on to say to the one who had invited Him, &ldquo;When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, otherwise they may also invite you in return and that will be your repayment.	42
NASB	Luke	14	13	&ldquo;But when you give a reception, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,	42
NASB	Luke	14	14	And you will be blessed, since they do not have the means to repay you; for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	14	15	When one of those who were reclining at the table with Him heard this, he said to Him, &ldquo;Blessed is everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	14	16	But He said to him, &ldquo;A man was giving a big dinner, and he invited many;	42
NASB	Luke	14	17	And at the dinner hour he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited, &lsquo;Come; for everything is ready now.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	14	18	&ldquo;But they all alike began to make excuses. The first one said to him, &lsquo;I have bought a piece of land and I need to go out and look at it; please consider me excused.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	14	19	&ldquo;Another one said, &lsquo;I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out; please consider me excused.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	14	2	And there in front of Him was a man suffering from dropsy.	42
NASB	Luke	14	20	&ldquo;Another one said, &lsquo;I have married a wife, and for that reason I cannot come.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	14	21	&ldquo;And the slave came back and reported this to his master. Then the head of the household became angry and said to his slave, &lsquo;Go out at once into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	14	22	&ldquo;And the slave said, &lsquo;Master, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	14	23	&ldquo;And the master said to the slave, &lsquo;Go out into the highways and along the hedges, and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled.	42
NASB	Luke	14	24	&lsquo;For I tell you, none of those men who were invited shall taste of my dinner.&rsquo;&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	14	25	Now large crowds were going along with Him; and He turned and said to them,	42
NASB	Luke	14	26	&ldquo;If anyone comes to Me, and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be My disciple.	42
NASB	Luke	14	27	&ldquo;Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.	42
NASB	Luke	14	28	&ldquo;For which one of you, when he wants to build a tower, does not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if he has enough to complete it?	42
NASB	Luke	14	29	&ldquo;Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who observe it begin to ridicule him,	42
NASB	Luke	14	3	And Jesus answered and spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, &ldquo;Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	14	30	Saying, &lsquo;This man began to build and was not able to finish.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	14	31	&ldquo;Or what king, when he sets out to meet another king in battle, will not first sit down and consider whether he is strong enough with ten thousand men to encounter the one coming against him with twenty thousand?	42
NASB	Luke	14	32	&ldquo;Or else, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace.	42
NASB	Luke	14	33	&ldquo;So then, none of you can be My disciple who does not give up all his own possessions.	42
NASB	Luke	14	34	&ldquo;Therefore, salt is good; but if even salt has become tasteless, with what will it be seasoned?	42
NASB	Luke	14	35	&ldquo;It is useless either for the soil or for the manure pile; it is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	14	4	But they kept silent. And He took hold of him and healed him, and sent him away.	42
NASB	Luke	14	5	And He said to them, &ldquo;Which one of you will have a son or an ox fall into a well, and will not immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	14	6	And they could make no reply to this.	42
NASB	Luke	14	7	And He began speaking a parable to the invited guests when He noticed how they had been picking out the places of honor at the table, saying to them,	42
NASB	Luke	14	8	&ldquo;When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for someone more distinguished than you may have been invited by him,	42
NASB	Luke	14	9	And he who invited you both will come and say to you, &lsquo;Give your place to this man,&rsquo; and then in disgrace you proceed to occupy the last place.	42
NASB	Luke	15	1	Now all the tax collectors and the sinners were coming near Him to listen to Him.	42
NASB	Luke	15	10	&ldquo;In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	15	11	And He said, &ldquo;A man had two sons.	42
NASB	Luke	15	12	&ldquo;The younger of them said to his father, &lsquo;Father, give me the share of the estate that falls to me.&rsquo; So he divided his wealth between them.	42
NASB	Luke	15	13	&ldquo;And not many days later, the younger son gathered everything together and went on a journey into a distant country, and there he squandered his estate with loose living.	42
NASB	Luke	15	14	&ldquo;Now when he had spent everything, a severe famine occurred in that country, and he began to be impoverished.	42
NASB	Luke	15	15	&ldquo;So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.	42
NASB	Luke	15	16	&ldquo;And he would have gladly filled his stomach with the pods that the swine were eating, and no one was giving anything to him.	42
NASB	Luke	15	17	&ldquo;But when he came to his senses, he said, &lsquo;How many of my father&rsquo;s hired men have more than enough bread, but I am dying here with hunger!	42
NASB	Luke	15	18	&lsquo;I will get up and go to my father, and will say to him, &ldquo;Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight;	42
NASB	Luke	15	19	I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me as one of your hired men.&rsquo;&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	15	2	Both the Pharisees and the scribes began to grumble, saying, &ldquo;This man receives sinners and eats with them.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	15	20	&ldquo;So he got up and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion for him, and ran and embraced him and kissed him.	42
NASB	Luke	15	21	&ldquo;And the son said to him, &lsquo;Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	15	22	&ldquo;But the father said to his slaves, &lsquo;Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet;	42
NASB	Luke	15	23	And bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let us eat and celebrate;	42
NASB	Luke	15	24	For this son of mine was dead and has come to life again; he was lost and has been found.&rsquo; And they began to celebrate.	42
NASB	Luke	15	25	&ldquo;Now his older son was in the field, and when he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing.	42
NASB	Luke	15	26	&ldquo;And he summoned one of the servants and began inquiring what these things could be.	42
NASB	Luke	15	27	&ldquo;And he said to him, &lsquo;Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him back safe and sound.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	15	28	&ldquo;But he became angry and was not willing to go in; and his father came out and began pleading with him.	42
NASB	Luke	15	29	&ldquo;But he answered and said to his father, &lsquo;Look! For so many years I have been serving you and I have never neglected a command of yours; and yet you have never given me a young goat, so that I might celebrate with my friends;	42
NASB	Luke	15	3	So He told them this parable, saying,	42
NASB	Luke	15	30	But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your wealth with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	15	31	&ldquo;And he said to him, &lsquo;Son, you have always been with me, and all that is mine is yours.	42
NASB	Luke	15	32	&lsquo;But we had to celebrate and rejoice, for this brother of yours was dead and has begun to live, and was lost and has been found.&rsquo;&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	15	4	&ldquo;What man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?	42
NASB	Luke	15	5	&ldquo;When he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.	42
NASB	Luke	15	6	&ldquo;And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, &lsquo;Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	15	7	&ldquo;I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.	42
NASB	Luke	15	8	&ldquo;Or what woman, if she has ten silver coins and loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?	42
NASB	Luke	15	9	&ldquo;When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, &lsquo;Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I had lost!&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	16	1	Now He was also saying to the disciples, &ldquo;There was a rich man who had a manager, and this manager was reported to him as squandering his possessions.	42
NASB	Luke	16	10	&ldquo;He who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much; and he who is unrighteous in a very little thing is unrighteous also in much.	42
NASB	Luke	16	11	&ldquo;Therefore if you have not been faithful in the use of unrighteous wealth, who will entrust the true riches to you?	42
NASB	Luke	16	12	&ldquo;And if you have not been faithful in the use of that which is another&rsquo;s, who will give you that which is your own?	42
NASB	Luke	16	13	&ldquo;No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	16	14	Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, were listening to all these things and were scoffing at Him.	42
NASB	Luke	16	15	And He said to them, &ldquo;You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts; for that which is highly esteemed among men is detestable in the sight of God.	42
NASB	Luke	16	16	&ldquo;The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John; since that time the gospel of the kingdom of God has been preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.	42
NASB	Luke	16	17	&ldquo;But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the Law to fail.	42
NASB	Luke	16	18	&ldquo;Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery.	42
NASB	Luke	16	19	&ldquo;Now there was a rich man, and he habitually dressed in purple and fine linen, joyously living in splendor every day.	42
NASB	Luke	16	2	&ldquo;And he called him and said to him, &lsquo;What is this I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management, for you can no longer be manager.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	16	20	&ldquo;And a poor man named Lazarus was laid at his gate, covered with sores,	42
NASB	Luke	16	21	And longing to be fed with the crumbs which were falling from the rich man&rsquo;s table; besides, even the dogs were coming and licking his sores.	42
NASB	Luke	16	22	&ldquo;Now the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham&rsquo;s bosom; and the rich man also died and was buried.	42
NASB	Luke	16	23	&ldquo;In Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his bosom.	42
NASB	Luke	16	24	&ldquo;And he cried out and said, &lsquo;Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool off my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	16	25	&ldquo;But Abraham said, &lsquo;Child, remember that during your life you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus bad things; but now he is being comforted here, and you are in agony.	42
NASB	Luke	16	26	&lsquo;And besides all this, between us and you there is a great chasm fixed, so that those who wish to come over from here to you will not be able, and that none may cross over from there to us.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	16	27	&ldquo;And he said, &lsquo;Then I beg you, father, that you send him to my father&rsquo;s house&mdash;	42
NASB	Luke	16	28	For I have five brothers&mdash;in order that he may warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	16	29	&ldquo;But Abraham said, &lsquo;They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	16	3	&ldquo;The manager said to himself, &lsquo;What shall I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig; I am ashamed to beg.	42
NASB	Luke	16	30	&ldquo;But he said, &lsquo;No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent!&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	16	31	&ldquo;But he said to him, &lsquo;If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead.&rsquo;&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	16	4	&lsquo;I know what I shall do, so that when I am removed from the management people will welcome me into their homes.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	16	5	&ldquo;And he summoned each one of his master&rsquo;s debtors, and he began saying to the first, &lsquo;How much do you owe my master?&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	16	6	&ldquo;And he said, &lsquo;A hundred measures of oil.&rsquo; And he said to him, &lsquo;Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	16	7	&ldquo;Then he said to another, &lsquo;And how much do you owe?&rsquo; And he said, &lsquo;A hundred measures of wheat.&rsquo; He said to him, &lsquo;Take your bill, and write eighty.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	16	8	&ldquo;And his master praised the unrighteous manager because he had acted shrewdly; for the sons of this age are more shrewd in relation to their own kind than the sons of light.	42
NASB	Luke	16	9	&ldquo;And I say to you, make friends for yourselves by means of the wealth of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they will receive you into the eternal dwellings.	42
NASB	Luke	17	1	He said to His disciples, &ldquo;It is inevitable that stumbling blocks come, but woe to him through whom they come!	42
NASB	Luke	17	10	&ldquo;So you too, when you do all the things which are commanded you, say, &lsquo;We are unworthy slaves; we have done only that which we ought to have done.&rsquo;&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	17	11	While He was on the way to Jerusalem, He was passing between Samaria and Galilee.	42
NASB	Luke	17	12	As He entered a village, ten leprous men who stood at a distance met Him;	42
NASB	Luke	17	13	And they raised their voices, saying, &ldquo;Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	17	14	When He saw them, He said to them, &ldquo;Go and show yourselves to the priests.&rdquo; And as they were going, they were cleansed.	42
NASB	Luke	17	15	Now one of them, when he saw that he had been healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice,	42
NASB	Luke	17	16	And he fell on his face at His feet, giving thanks to Him. And he was a Samaritan.	42
NASB	Luke	17	17	Then Jesus answered and said, &ldquo;Were there not ten cleansed? But the nine&mdash;where are they?	42
NASB	Luke	17	18	&ldquo;Was no one found who returned to give glory to God, except this foreigner?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	17	19	And He said to him, &ldquo;Stand up and go; your faith has made you well.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	17	2	&ldquo;It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea, than that he would cause one of these little ones to stumble.	42
NASB	Luke	17	20	Now having been questioned by the Pharisees as to when the kingdom of God was coming, He answered them and said, &ldquo;The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed;	42
NASB	Luke	17	21	Nor will they say, &lsquo;Look, here it is!&rsquo; or, &lsquo;There it is!&rsquo; For behold, the kingdom of God is in your midst.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	17	22	And He said to the disciples, &ldquo;The days will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.	42
NASB	Luke	17	23	&ldquo;They will say to you, &lsquo;Look there! Look here!&rsquo; Do not go away, and do not run after them.	42
NASB	Luke	17	24	&ldquo;For just like the lightning, when it flashes out of one part of the sky, shines to the other part of the sky, so will the Son of Man be in His day.	42
NASB	Luke	17	25	&ldquo;But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.	42
NASB	Luke	17	26	&ldquo;And just as it happened in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man:	42
NASB	Luke	17	27	They were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.	42
NASB	Luke	17	28	&ldquo;It was the same as happened in the days of Lot: they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building;	42
NASB	Luke	17	29	But on the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.	42
NASB	Luke	17	3	&ldquo;Be on your guard! If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.	42
NASB	Luke	17	30	&ldquo;It will be just the same on the day that the Son of Man is revealed.	42
NASB	Luke	17	31	&ldquo;On that day, the one who is on the housetop and whose goods are in the house must not go down to take them out; and likewise the one who is in the field must not turn back.	42
NASB	Luke	17	32	&ldquo;Remember Lot&rsquo;s wife.	42
NASB	Luke	17	33	&ldquo;Whoever seeks to keep his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life will preserve it.	42
NASB	Luke	17	34	&ldquo;I tell you, on that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other will be left.	42
NASB	Luke	17	35	&ldquo;There will be two women grinding at the same place; one will be taken and the other will be left.	42
NASB	Luke	17	36	[&ldquo;Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other will be left.&rdquo;]	42
NASB	Luke	17	37	And answering they said to Him, &ldquo;Where, Lord?&rdquo; And He said to them, &ldquo;Where the body is, there also the vultures will be gathered.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	17	4	&ldquo;And if he sins against you seven times a day, and returns to you seven times, saying, &lsquo;I repent,&rsquo; forgive him.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	17	5	The apostles said to the Lord, &ldquo;Increase our faith!&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	17	6	And the Lord said, &ldquo;If you had faith like a mustard seed, you would say to this mulberry tree, &lsquo;Be uprooted and be planted in the sea&rsquo;; and it would obey you.	42
NASB	Luke	17	7	&ldquo;Which of you, having a slave plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, &lsquo;Come immediately and sit down to eat&rsquo;?	42
NASB	Luke	17	8	&ldquo;But will he not say to him, &lsquo;Prepare something for me to eat, and properly clothe yourself and serve me while I eat and drink; and afterward you may eat and drink&rsquo;?	42
NASB	Luke	17	9	&ldquo;He does not thank the slave because he did the things which were commanded, does he?	42
NASB	Luke	18	1	Now He was telling them a parable to show that at all times they ought to pray and not to lose heart,	42
NASB	Luke	18	10	&ldquo;Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.	42
NASB	Luke	18	11	&ldquo;The Pharisee stood and was praying this to himself: &lsquo;God, I thank You that I am not like other people: swindlers, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.	42
NASB	Luke	18	12	&lsquo;I fast twice a week; I pay tithes of all that I get.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	18	13	&ldquo;But the tax collector, standing some distance away, was even unwilling to lift up his eyes to heaven, but was beating his breast, saying, &lsquo;God, be merciful to me, the sinner!&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	18	14	&ldquo;I tell you, this man went to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	18	15	And they were bringing even their babies to Him so that He would touch them, but when the disciples saw it, they began rebuking them.	42
NASB	Luke	18	16	But Jesus called for them, saying, &ldquo;Permit the children to come to Me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.	42
NASB	Luke	18	17	&ldquo;Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	18	18	A ruler questioned Him, saying, &ldquo;Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	18	19	And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Why do you call Me good? No one is good except God alone.	42
NASB	Luke	18	2	Saying, &ldquo;In a certain city there was a judge who did not fear God and did not respect man.	42
NASB	Luke	18	20	&ldquo;You know the commandments, &lsquo;DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY, DO NOT MURDER, DO NOT STEAL, DO NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS, HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER.&rsquo;&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	18	21	And he said, &ldquo;All these things I have kept from my youth.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	18	22	When Jesus heard this, He said to him, &ldquo;One thing you still lack; sell all that you possess and distribute it to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	18	23	But when he had heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich.	42
NASB	Luke	18	24	And Jesus looked at him and said, &ldquo;How hard it is for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!	42
NASB	Luke	18	25	&ldquo;For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	18	26	They who heard it said, &ldquo;Then who can be saved?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	18	27	But He said, &ldquo;The things that are impossible with people are possible with God.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	18	28	Peter said, &ldquo;Behold, we have left our own homes and followed You.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	18	29	And He said to them, &ldquo;Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,	42
NASB	Luke	18	3	&ldquo;There was a widow in that city, and she kept coming to him, saying, &lsquo;Give me legal protection from my opponent.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	18	30	Who will not receive many times as much at this time and in the age to come, eternal life.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	18	31	Then He took the twelve aside and said to them, &ldquo;Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things which are written through the prophets about the Son of Man will be accomplished.	42
NASB	Luke	18	32	&ldquo;For He will be handed over to the Gentiles, and will be mocked and mistreated and spit upon,	42
NASB	Luke	18	33	And after they have scourged Him, they will kill Him; and the third day He will rise again.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	18	34	But the disciples understood none of these things, and the meaning of this statement was hidden from them, and they did not comprehend the things that were said.	42
NASB	Luke	18	35	As Jesus was approaching Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the road begging.	42
NASB	Luke	18	36	Now hearing a crowd going by, he began to inquire what this was.	42
NASB	Luke	18	37	They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.	42
NASB	Luke	18	38	And he called out, saying, &ldquo;Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	18	39	Those who led the way were sternly telling him to be quiet; but he kept crying out all the more, &ldquo;Son of David, have mercy on me!&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	18	4	&ldquo;For a while he was unwilling; but afterward he said to himself, &lsquo;Even though I do not fear God nor respect man,	42
NASB	Luke	18	40	And Jesus stopped and commanded that he be brought to Him; and when he came near, He questioned him,	42
NASB	Luke	18	41	&ldquo;What do you want Me to do for you?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Lord, I want to regain my sight!&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	18	42	And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Receive your sight; your faith has made you well.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	18	43	Immediately he regained his sight and began following Him, glorifying God; and when all the people saw it, they gave praise to God.	42
NASB	Luke	18	5	Yet because this widow bothers me, I will give her legal protection, otherwise by continually coming she will wear me out.&rsquo;&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	18	6	And the Lord said, &ldquo;Hear what the unrighteous judge said;	42
NASB	Luke	18	7	Now, will not God bring about justice for His elect who cry to Him day and night, and will He delay long over them?	42
NASB	Luke	18	8	&ldquo;I tell you that He will bring about justice for them quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	18	9	And He also told this parable to some people who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and viewed others with contempt:	42
NASB	Luke	19	1	He entered Jericho and was passing through.	42
NASB	Luke	19	10	&ldquo;For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	19	11	While they were listening to these things, Jesus went on to tell a parable, because He was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately.	42
NASB	Luke	19	12	So He said, &ldquo;A nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself, and then return.	42
NASB	Luke	19	13	&ldquo;And he called ten of his slaves, and gave them ten minas and said to them, &lsquo;Do business with this until I come back.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	19	14	&ldquo;But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, &lsquo;We do not want this man to reign over us.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	19	15	&ldquo;When he returned, after receiving the kingdom, he ordered that these slaves, to whom he had given the money, be called to him so that he might know what business they had done.	42
NASB	Luke	19	16	&ldquo;The first appeared, saying, &lsquo;Master, your mina has made ten minas more.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	19	17	&ldquo;And he said to him, &lsquo;Well done, good slave, because you have been faithful in a very little thing, you are to be in authority over ten cities.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	19	18	&ldquo;The second came, saying, &lsquo;Your mina, master, has made five minas.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	19	19	&ldquo;And he said to him also, &lsquo;And you are to be over five cities.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	19	2	And there was a man called by the name of Zaccheus; he was a chief tax collector and he was rich.	42
NASB	Luke	19	20	&ldquo;Another came, saying, &lsquo;Master, here is your mina, which I kept put away in a handkerchief;	42
NASB	Luke	19	21	For I was afraid of you, because you are an exacting man; you take up what you did not lay down and reap what you did not sow.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	19	22	&ldquo;He said to him, &lsquo;By your own words I will judge you, you worthless slave. Did you know that I am an exacting man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow?	42
NASB	Luke	19	23	&lsquo;Then why did you not put my money in the bank, and having come, I would have collected it with interest?&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	19	24	&ldquo;Then he said to the bystanders, &lsquo;Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has the ten minas.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	19	25	&ldquo;And they said to him, &lsquo;Master, he has ten minas already.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	19	26	&ldquo;I tell you that to everyone who has, more shall be given, but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away.	42
NASB	Luke	19	27	&ldquo;But these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them in my presence.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	19	28	After He had said these things, He was going on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.	42
NASB	Luke	19	29	When He approached Bethphage and Bethany, near the mount that is called Olivet, He sent two of the disciples,	42
NASB	Luke	19	3	Zaccheus was trying to see who Jesus was, and was unable because of the crowd, for he was small in stature.	42
NASB	Luke	19	30	Saying, &ldquo;Go into the village ahead of you; there, as you enter, you will find a colt tied on which no one yet has ever sat; untie it and bring it here.	42
NASB	Luke	19	31	&ldquo;If anyone asks you, &lsquo;Why are you untying it?&rsquo; you shall say, &lsquo;The Lord has need of it.&rsquo;&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	19	32	So those who were sent went away and found it just as He had told them.	42
NASB	Luke	19	33	As they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, &ldquo;Why are you untying the colt?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	19	34	They said, &ldquo;The Lord has need of it.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	19	35	They brought it to Jesus, and they threw their coats on the colt and put Jesus on it.	42
NASB	Luke	19	36	As He was going, they were spreading their coats on the road.	42
NASB	Luke	19	37	As soon as He was approaching, near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the miracles which they had seen,	42
NASB	Luke	19	38	Shouting: &ldquo;BLESSED IS THE KING WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD; Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	19	39	Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Him, &ldquo;Teacher, rebuke Your disciples.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	19	4	So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree in order to see Him, for He was about to pass through that way.	42
NASB	Luke	19	40	But Jesus answered, &ldquo;I tell you, if these become silent, the stones will cry out!&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	19	41	When He approached Jerusalem, He saw the city and wept over it,	42
NASB	Luke	19	42	Saying, &ldquo;If you had known in this day, even you, the things which make for peace! But now they have been hidden from your eyes.	42
NASB	Luke	19	43	&ldquo;For the days will come upon you when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you, and surround you and hem you in on every side,	42
NASB	Luke	19	44	And they will level you to the ground and your children within you, and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	19	45	Jesus entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling,	42
NASB	Luke	19	46	Saying to them, &ldquo;It is written, &lsquo;AND MY HOUSE SHALL BE A HOUSE OF PRAYER,&rsquo; but you have made it a ROBBERs&rsquo; DEN.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	19	47	And He was teaching daily in the temple; but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people were trying to destroy Him,	42
NASB	Luke	19	48	And they could not find anything that they might do, for all the people were hanging on to every word He said.	42
NASB	Luke	19	5	When Jesus came to the place, He looked up and said to him, &ldquo;Zaccheus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	19	6	And he hurried and came down and received Him gladly.	42
NASB	Luke	19	7	When they saw it, they all began to grumble, saying, &ldquo;He has gone to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	19	8	Zaccheus stopped and said to the Lord, &ldquo;Behold, Lord, half of my possessions I will give to the poor, and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will give back four times as much.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	19	9	And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Today salvation has come to this house, because he, too, is a son of Abraham.	42
NASB	Luke	2	1	Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus, that a census be taken of all the inhabited earth.	42
NASB	Luke	2	10	But the angel said to them, &ldquo;Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all the people;	42
NASB	Luke	2	11	For today in the city of David there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.	42
NASB	Luke	2	12	&ldquo;This will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	2	13	And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,	42
NASB	Luke	2	14	&ldquo;Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace among men with whom He is pleased.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	2	15	When the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds began saying to one another, &ldquo;Let us go straight to Bethlehem then, and see this thing that has happened which the Lord has made known to us.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	2	16	So they came in a hurry and found their way to Mary and Joseph, and the baby as He lay in the manger.	42
NASB	Luke	2	17	When they had seen this, they made known the statement which had been told them about this Child.	42
NASB	Luke	2	18	And all who heard it wondered at the things which were told them by the shepherds.	42
NASB	Luke	2	19	But Mary treasured all these things, pondering them in her heart.	42
NASB	Luke	2	2	This was the first census taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria.	42
NASB	Luke	2	20	The shepherds went back, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as had been told them.	42
NASB	Luke	2	21	And when eight days had passed, before His circumcision, His name was then called Jesus, the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.	42
NASB	Luke	2	22	And when the days for their purification according to the law of Moses were completed, they brought Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord	42
NASB	Luke	2	23	(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, &ldquo;EVERY firstborn MALE THAT OPENS THE WOMB SHALL BE CALLED HOLY TO THE LORD&rdquo;),	42
NASB	Luke	2	24	And to offer a sacrifice according to what was said in the Law of the Lord, &ldquo;A PAIR OF TURTLEDOVES OR TWO YOUNG PIGEONS.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	2	25	And there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Spirit was upon him.	42
NASB	Luke	2	26	And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord&rsquo;s Christ.	42
NASB	Luke	2	27	And he came in the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to carry out for Him the custom of the Law,	42
NASB	Luke	2	28	Then he took Him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,	42
NASB	Luke	2	29	&ldquo;Now Lord, You are releasing Your bond-servant to depart in peace, According to Your word;	42
NASB	Luke	2	3	And everyone was on his way to register for the census, each to his own city.	42
NASB	Luke	2	30	For my eyes have seen Your salvation,	42
NASB	Luke	2	31	Which You have prepared in the presence of all peoples,	42
NASB	Luke	2	32	A LIGHT OF REVELATION TO THE GENTILES, And the glory of Your people Israel.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	2	33	And His father and mother were amazed at the things which were being said about Him.	42
NASB	Luke	2	34	And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary His mother, &ldquo;Behold, this Child is appointed for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and for a sign to be opposed&mdash;	42
NASB	Luke	2	35	And a sword will pierce even your own soul&mdash;to the end that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	2	36	And there was a prophetess, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years and had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,	42
NASB	Luke	2	37	And then as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the temple, serving night and day with fastings and prayers.	42
NASB	Luke	2	38	At that very moment she came up and began giving thanks to God, and continued to speak of Him to all those who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.	42
NASB	Luke	2	39	When they had performed everything according to the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city of Nazareth.	42
NASB	Luke	2	4	Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,	42
NASB	Luke	2	40	The Child continued to grow and become strong, increasing in wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.	42
NASB	Luke	2	41	Now His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover.	42
NASB	Luke	2	42	And when He became twelve, they went up there according to the custom of the Feast;	42
NASB	Luke	2	43	And as they were returning, after spending the full number of days, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. But His parents were unaware of it,	42
NASB	Luke	2	44	But supposed Him to be in the caravan, and went a day&rsquo;s journey; and they began looking for Him among their relatives and acquaintances.	42
NASB	Luke	2	45	When they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem looking for Him.	42
NASB	Luke	2	46	Then, after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions.	42
NASB	Luke	2	47	And all who heard Him were amazed at His understanding and His answers.	42
NASB	Luke	2	48	When they saw Him, they were astonished; and His mother said to Him, &ldquo;Son, why have You treated us this way? Behold, Your father and I have been anxiously looking for You.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	2	49	And He said to them, &ldquo;Why is it that you were looking for Me? Did you not know that I had to be in My Father&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	2	5	In order to register along with Mary, who was engaged to him, and was with child.	42
NASB	Luke	2	50	But they did not understand the statement which He had made to them.	42
NASB	Luke	2	51	And He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and He continued in subjection to them; and His mother treasured all these things in her heart.	42
NASB	Luke	2	52	And Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.	42
NASB	Luke	2	6	While they were there, the days were completed for her to give birth.	42
NASB	Luke	2	7	And she gave birth to her firstborn son; and she wrapped Him in cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.	42
NASB	Luke	2	8	In the same region there were some shepherds staying out in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night.	42
NASB	Luke	2	9	And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened.	42
NASB	Luke	20	1	On one of the days while He was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes with the elders confronted Him,	42
NASB	Luke	20	10	&ldquo;At the harvest time he sent a slave to the vine-growers, so that they would give him some of the produce of the vineyard; but the vine-growers beat him and sent him away empty-handed.	42
NASB	Luke	20	11	&ldquo;And he proceeded to send another slave; and they beat him also and treated him shamefully and sent him away empty-handed.	42
NASB	Luke	20	12	&ldquo;And he proceeded to send a third; and this one also they wounded and cast out.	42
NASB	Luke	20	13	&ldquo;The owner of the vineyard said, &lsquo;What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	20	14	&ldquo;But when the vine-growers saw him, they reasoned with one another, saying, &lsquo;This is the heir; let us kill him so that the inheritance will be ours.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	20	15	&ldquo;So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What, then, will the owner of the vineyard do to them?	42
NASB	Luke	20	16	&ldquo;He will come and destroy these vine-growers and will give the vineyard to others.&rdquo; When they heard it, they said, &ldquo;May it never be!&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	20	17	But Jesus looked at them and said, &ldquo;What then is this that is written: &lsquo;THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone&rsquo;?	42
NASB	Luke	20	18	&ldquo;Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will scatter him like dust.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	20	19	The scribes and the chief priests tried to lay hands on Him that very hour, and they feared the people; for they understood that He spoke this parable against them.	42
NASB	Luke	20	2	And they spoke, saying to Him, &ldquo;Tell us by what authority You are doing these things, or who is the one who gave You this authority?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	20	20	So they watched Him, and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, in order that they might catch Him in some statement, so that they could deliver Him to the rule and the authority of the governor.	42
NASB	Luke	20	21	They questioned Him, saying, &ldquo;Teacher, we know that You speak and teach correctly, and You are not partial to any, but teach the way of God in truth.	42
NASB	Luke	20	22	&ldquo;Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	20	23	But He detected their trickery and said to them,	42
NASB	Luke	20	24	&ldquo;Show Me a denarius. Whose likeness and inscription does it have?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;Caesar&rsquo;s.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	20	25	And He said to them, &ldquo;Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar&rsquo;s, and to God the things that are God&rsquo;s.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	20	26	And they were unable to catch Him in a saying in the presence of the people; and being amazed at His answer, they became silent.	42
NASB	Luke	20	27	Now there came to Him some of the Sadducees (who say that there is no resurrection),	42
NASB	Luke	20	28	And they questioned Him, saying, &ldquo;Teacher, Moses wrote for us that IF A MAN&rsquo;s BROTHER DIES, having a wife, AND HE IS CHILDLESS, HIS BROTHER SHOULD MARRY THE WIFE AND RAISE UP CHILDREN TO HIS BROTHER.	42
NASB	Luke	20	29	&ldquo;Now there were seven brothers; and the first took a wife and died childless;	42
NASB	Luke	20	3	Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;I will also ask you a question, and you tell Me:	42
NASB	Luke	20	30	And the second	42
NASB	Luke	20	31	And the third married her; and in the same way all seven died, leaving no children.	42
NASB	Luke	20	32	&ldquo;Finally the woman died also.	42
NASB	Luke	20	33	&ldquo;In the resurrection therefore, which one&rsquo;s wife will she be? For all seven had married her.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	20	34	Jesus said to them, &ldquo;The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage,	42
NASB	Luke	20	35	But those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage;	42
NASB	Luke	20	36	For they cannot even die anymore, because they are like angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.	42
NASB	Luke	20	37	&ldquo;But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the passage about the burning bush, where he calls the Lord THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB.	42
NASB	Luke	20	38	&ldquo;Now He is not the God of the dead but of the living; for all live to Him.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	20	39	Some of the scribes answered and said, &ldquo;Teacher, You have spoken well.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	20	4	&ldquo;Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	20	40	For they did not have courage to question Him any longer about anything.	42
NASB	Luke	20	41	Then He said to them, &ldquo;How is it that they say the Christ is David&rsquo;s son?	42
NASB	Luke	20	42	&ldquo;For David himself says in the book of Psalms, &lsquo;THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD, &ldquo;SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND,	42
NASB	Luke	20	43	UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET.&rsquo;&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	20	44	&ldquo;Therefore David calls Him &lsquo;Lord,&rsquo; and how is He his son?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	20	45	And while all the people were listening, He said to the disciples,	42
NASB	Luke	20	46	&ldquo;Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love respectful greetings in the market places, and chief seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets,	42
NASB	Luke	20	47	Who devour widows&rsquo; houses, and for appearance&rsquo;s sake offer long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	20	5	They reasoned among themselves, saying, &ldquo;If we say, &lsquo;From heaven,&rsquo; He will say, &lsquo;Why did you not believe him?&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	20	6	&ldquo;But if we say, &lsquo;From men,&rsquo; all the people will stone us to death, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	20	7	So they answered that they did not know where it came from.	42
NASB	Luke	20	8	And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Nor will I tell you by what authority I do these things.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	20	9	And He began to tell the people this parable: &ldquo;A man planted a vineyard and rented it out to vine-growers, and went on a journey for a long time.	42
NASB	Luke	21	1	And He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury.	42
NASB	Luke	21	10	Then He continued by saying to them, &ldquo;Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom,	42
NASB	Luke	21	11	And there will be great earthquakes, and in various places plagues and famines; and there will be terrors and great signs from heaven.	42
NASB	Luke	21	12	&ldquo;But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you to the synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for My name&rsquo;s sake.	42
NASB	Luke	21	13	&ldquo;It will lead to an opportunity for your testimony.	42
NASB	Luke	21	14	&ldquo;So make up your minds not to prepare beforehand to defend yourselves;	42
NASB	Luke	21	15	For I will give you utterance and wisdom which none of your opponents will be able to resist or refute.	42
NASB	Luke	21	16	&ldquo;But you will be betrayed even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death,	42
NASB	Luke	21	17	And you will be hated by all because of My name.	42
NASB	Luke	21	18	&ldquo;Yet not a hair of your head will perish.	42
NASB	Luke	21	19	&ldquo;By your endurance you will gain your lives.	42
NASB	Luke	21	2	And He saw a poor widow putting in two small copper coins.	42
NASB	Luke	21	20	&ldquo;But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then recognize that her desolation is near.	42
NASB	Luke	21	21	&ldquo;Then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains, and those who are in the midst of the city must leave, and those who are in the country must not enter the city;	42
NASB	Luke	21	22	Because these are days of vengeance, so that all things which are written will be fulfilled.	42
NASB	Luke	21	23	&ldquo;Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days; for there will be great distress upon the land and wrath to this people;	42
NASB	Luke	21	24	And they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled under foot by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.	42
NASB	Luke	21	25	&ldquo;There will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth dismay among nations, in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the waves,	42
NASB	Luke	21	26	Men fainting from fear and the expectation of the things which are coming upon the world; for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.	42
NASB	Luke	21	27	&ldquo;Then they will see THE SON OF MAN COMING IN A CLOUD with power and great glory.	42
NASB	Luke	21	28	&ldquo;But when these things begin to take place, straighten up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	21	29	Then He told them a parable: &ldquo;Behold the fig tree and all the trees;	42
NASB	Luke	21	3	And He said, &ldquo;Truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all of them;	42
NASB	Luke	21	30	As soon as they put forth leaves, you see it and know for yourselves that summer is now near.	42
NASB	Luke	21	31	&ldquo;So you also, when you see these things happening, recognize that the kingdom of God is near.	42
NASB	Luke	21	32	&ldquo;Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all things take place.	42
NASB	Luke	21	33	&ldquo;Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.	42
NASB	Luke	21	34	&ldquo;Be on guard, so that your hearts will not be weighted down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of life, and that day will not come on you suddenly like a trap;	42
NASB	Luke	21	35	For it will come upon all those who dwell on the face of all the earth.	42
NASB	Luke	21	36	&ldquo;But keep on the alert at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	21	37	Now during the day He was teaching in the temple, but at evening He would go out and spend the night on the mount that is called Olivet.	42
NASB	Luke	21	38	And all the people would get up early in the morning to come to Him in the temple to listen to Him.	42
NASB	Luke	21	4	For they all out of their surplus put into the offering; but she out of her poverty put in all that she had to live on.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	21	5	And while some were talking about the temple, that it was adorned with beautiful stones and votive gifts, He said,	42
NASB	Luke	21	6	&ldquo;As for these things which you are looking at, the days will come in which there will not be left one stone upon another which will not be torn down.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	21	7	They questioned Him, saying, &ldquo;Teacher, when therefore will these things happen? And what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	21	8	And He said, &ldquo;See to it that you are not misled; for many will come in My name, saying, &lsquo;I am He,&rsquo; and, &lsquo;The time is near.&rsquo; Do not go after them.	42
NASB	Luke	21	9	&ldquo;When you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified; for these things must take place first, but the end does not follow immediately.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	1	Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching.	42
NASB	Luke	22	10	And He said to them, &ldquo;When you have entered the city, a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house that he enters.	42
NASB	Luke	22	11	&ldquo;And you shall say to the owner of the house, &lsquo;The Teacher says to you, &ldquo;Where is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?&rsquo;&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	12	&ldquo;And he will show you a large, furnished upper room; prepare it there.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	13	And they left and found everything just as He had told them; and they prepared the Passover.	42
NASB	Luke	22	14	When the hour had come, He reclined at the table, and the apostles with Him.	42
NASB	Luke	22	15	And He said to them, &ldquo;I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;	42
NASB	Luke	22	16	For I say to you, I shall never again eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	17	And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He said, &ldquo;Take this and share it among yourselves;	42
NASB	Luke	22	18	For I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	19	And when He had taken some bread and given thanks, He broke it and gave it to them, saying, &ldquo;This is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	2	The chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might put Him to death; for they were afraid of the people.	42
NASB	Luke	22	20	And in the same way He took the cup after they had eaten, saying, &ldquo;This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in My blood.	42
NASB	Luke	22	21	&ldquo;But behold, the hand of the one betraying Me is with Mine on the table.	42
NASB	Luke	22	22	&ldquo;For indeed, the Son of Man is going as it has been determined; but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	23	And they began to discuss among themselves which one of them it might be who was going to do this thing.	42
NASB	Luke	22	24	And there arose also a dispute among them as to which one of them was regarded to be greatest.	42
NASB	Luke	22	25	And He said to them, &ldquo;The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who have authority over them are called &lsquo;Benefactors.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	26	&ldquo;But it is not this way with you, but the one who is the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like the servant.	42
NASB	Luke	22	27	&ldquo;For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at the table? But I am among you as the one who serves.	42
NASB	Luke	22	28	&ldquo;You are those who have stood by Me in My trials;	42
NASB	Luke	22	29	And just as My Father has granted Me a kingdom, I grant you	42
NASB	Luke	22	3	And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot, belonging to the number of the twelve.	42
NASB	Luke	22	30	That you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.	42
NASB	Luke	22	31	&ldquo;Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded permission to sift you like wheat;	42
NASB	Luke	22	32	But I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail; and you, when once you have turned again, strengthen your brothers.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	33	But he said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, with You I am ready to go both to prison and to death!&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	34	And He said, &ldquo;I say to you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	35	And He said to them, &ldquo;When I sent you out without money belt and bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;No, nothing.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	36	And He said to them, &ldquo;But now, whoever has a money belt is to take it along, likewise also a bag, and whoever has no sword is to sell his coat and buy one.	42
NASB	Luke	22	37	&ldquo;For I tell you that this which is written must be fulfilled in Me, &lsquo;AND HE WAS NUMBERED WITH TRANSGRESSORS&rsquo;; for that which refers to Me has its fulfillment.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	38	They said, &ldquo;Lord, look, here are two swords.&rdquo; And He said to them, &ldquo;It is enough.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	39	And He came out and proceeded as was His custom to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed Him.	42
NASB	Luke	22	4	And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers how he might betray Him to them.	42
NASB	Luke	22	40	When He arrived at the place, He said to them, &ldquo;Pray that you may not enter into temptation.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	41	And He withdrew from them about a stone&rsquo;s throw, and He knelt down and began to pray,	42
NASB	Luke	22	42	Saying, &ldquo;Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me; yet not My will, but Yours be done.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	43	Now an angel from heaven appeared to Him, strengthening Him.	42
NASB	Luke	22	44	And being in agony He was praying very fervently; and His sweat became like drops of blood, falling down upon the ground.	42
NASB	Luke	22	45	When He rose from prayer, He came to the disciples and found them sleeping from sorrow,	42
NASB	Luke	22	46	And said to them, &ldquo;Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not enter into temptation.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	47	While He was still speaking, behold, a crowd came, and the one called Judas, one of the twelve, was preceding them; and he approached Jesus to kiss Him.	42
NASB	Luke	22	48	But Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	49	When those who were around Him saw what was going to happen, they said, &ldquo;Lord, shall we strike with the sword?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	5	They were glad and agreed to give him money.	42
NASB	Luke	22	50	And one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear.	42
NASB	Luke	22	51	But Jesus answered and said, &ldquo;Stop! No more of this.&rdquo; And He touched his ear and healed him.	42
NASB	Luke	22	52	Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders who had come against Him, &ldquo;Have you come out with swords and clubs as you would against a robber?	42
NASB	Luke	22	53	&ldquo;While I was with you daily in the temple, you did not lay hands on Me; but this hour and the power of darkness are yours.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	54	Having arrested Him, they led Him away and brought Him to the house of the high priest; but Peter was following at a distance.	42
NASB	Luke	22	55	After they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter was sitting among them.	42
NASB	Luke	22	56	And a servant-girl, seeing him as he sat in the firelight and looking intently at him, said, &ldquo;This man was with Him too.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	57	But he denied it, saying, &ldquo;Woman, I do not know Him.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	58	A little later, another saw him and said, &ldquo;You are one of them too!&rdquo; But Peter said, &ldquo;Man, I am not!&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	59	After about an hour had passed, another man began to insist, saying, &ldquo;Certainly this man also was with Him, for he is a Galilean too.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	6	So he consented, and began seeking a good opportunity to betray Him to them apart from the crowd.	42
NASB	Luke	22	60	But Peter said, &ldquo;Man, I do not know what you are talking about.&rdquo; Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.	42
NASB	Luke	22	61	The Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had told him, &ldquo;Before a rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	62	And he went out and wept bitterly.	42
NASB	Luke	22	63	Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking Him and beating Him,	42
NASB	Luke	22	64	And they blindfolded Him and were asking Him, saying, &ldquo;Prophesy, who is the one who hit You?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	65	And they were saying many other things against Him, blaspheming.	42
NASB	Luke	22	66	When it was day, the Council of elders of the people assembled, both chief priests and scribes, and they led Him away to their council chamber, saying,	42
NASB	Luke	22	67	&ldquo;If You are the Christ, tell us.&rdquo; But He said to them, &ldquo;If I tell you, you will not believe;	42
NASB	Luke	22	68	And if I ask a question, you will not answer.	42
NASB	Luke	22	69	&ldquo;But from now on THE SON OF MAN WILL BE SEATED AT THE RIGHT HAND of the power OF GOD.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	7	Then came the first day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.	42
NASB	Luke	22	70	And they all said, &ldquo;Are You the Son of God, then?&rdquo; And He said to them, &ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	71	Then they said, &ldquo;What further need do we have of testimony? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	8	And Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, &ldquo;Go and prepare the Passover for us, so that we may eat it.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	22	9	They said to Him, &ldquo;Where do You want us to prepare it?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	23	1	Then the whole body of them got up and brought Him before Pilate.	42
NASB	Luke	23	10	And the chief priests and the scribes were standing there, accusing Him vehemently.	42
NASB	Luke	23	11	And Herod with his soldiers, after treating Him with contempt and mocking Him, dressed Him in a gorgeous robe and sent Him back to Pilate.	42
NASB	Luke	23	12	Now Herod and Pilate became friends with one another that very day; for before they had been enemies with each other.	42
NASB	Luke	23	13	Pilate summoned the chief priests and the rulers and the people,	42
NASB	Luke	23	14	And said to them, &ldquo;You brought this man to me as one who incites the people to rebellion, and behold, having examined Him before you, I have found no guilt in this man regarding the charges which you make against Him.	42
NASB	Luke	23	15	&ldquo;No, nor has Herod, for he sent Him back to us; and behold, nothing deserving death has been done by Him.	42
NASB	Luke	23	16	&ldquo;Therefore I will punish Him and release Him.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	23	17	[Now he was obliged to release to them at the feast one prisoner.]	42
NASB	Luke	23	18	But they cried out all together, saying, &ldquo;Away with this man, and release for us Barabbas!&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	23	19	(He was one who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection made in the city, and for murder.)	42
NASB	Luke	23	2	And they began to accuse Him, saying, &ldquo;We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, and saying that He Himself is Christ, a King.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	23	20	Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again,	42
NASB	Luke	23	21	But they kept on calling out, saying, &ldquo;Crucify, crucify Him!&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	23	22	And he said to them the third time, &ldquo;Why, what evil has this man done? I have found in Him no guilt demanding death; therefore I will punish Him and release Him.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	23	23	But they were insistent, with loud voices asking that He be crucified. And their voices began to prevail.	42
NASB	Luke	23	24	And Pilate pronounced sentence that their demand be granted.	42
NASB	Luke	23	25	And he released the man they were asking for who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, but he delivered Jesus to their will.	42
NASB	Luke	23	26	When they led Him away, they seized a man, Simon of Cyrene, coming in from the country, and placed on him the cross to carry behind Jesus.	42
NASB	Luke	23	27	And following Him was a large crowd of the people, and of women who were mourning and lamenting Him.	42
NASB	Luke	23	28	But Jesus turning to them said, &ldquo;Daughters of Jerusalem, stop weeping for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.	42
NASB	Luke	23	29	&ldquo;For behold, the days are coming when they will say, &lsquo;Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	23	3	So Pilate asked Him, saying, &ldquo;Are You the King of the Jews?&rdquo; And He answered him and said, &ldquo;It is as you say.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	23	30	&ldquo;Then they will begin TO SAY TO THE MOUNTAINS, &lsquo;FALL ON US,&rsquo; AND TO THE HILLS, &lsquo;COVER US.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	23	31	&ldquo;For if they do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	23	32	Two others also, who were criminals, were being led away to be put to death with Him.	42
NASB	Luke	23	33	When they came to the place called The Skull, there they crucified Him and the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.	42
NASB	Luke	23	34	But Jesus was saying, &ldquo;Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.&rdquo; And they cast lots, dividing up His garments among themselves.	42
NASB	Luke	23	35	And the people stood by, looking on. And even the rulers were sneering at Him, saying, &ldquo;He saved others; let Him save Himself if this is the Christ of God, His Chosen One.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	23	36	The soldiers also mocked Him, coming up to Him, offering Him sour wine,	42
NASB	Luke	23	37	And saying, &ldquo;If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself!&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	23	38	Now there was also an inscription above Him, &ldquo;THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	23	39	One of the criminals who were hanged there was hurling abuse at Him, saying, &ldquo;Are You not the Christ? Save Yourself and us!&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	23	4	Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, &ldquo;I find no guilt in this man.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	23	40	But the other answered, and rebuking him said, &ldquo;Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?	42
NASB	Luke	23	41	&ldquo;And we indeed are suffering justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	23	42	And he was saying, &ldquo;Jesus, remember me when You come in Your kingdom!&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	23	43	And He said to him, &ldquo;Truly I say to you, today you shall be with Me in Paradise.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	23	44	It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour,	42
NASB	Luke	23	45	Because the sun was obscured; and the veil of the temple was torn in two.	42
NASB	Luke	23	46	And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, &ldquo;Father, INTO YOUR HANDS I COMMIT MY SPIRIT.&rdquo; Having said this, He breathed His last.	42
NASB	Luke	23	47	Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he began praising God, saying, &ldquo;Certainly this man was innocent.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	23	48	And all the crowds who came together for this spectacle, when they observed what had happened, began to return, beating their breasts.	42
NASB	Luke	23	49	And all His acquaintances and the women who accompanied Him from Galilee were standing at a distance, seeing these things.	42
NASB	Luke	23	5	But they kept on insisting, saying, &ldquo;He stirs up the people, teaching all over Judea, starting from Galilee even as far as this place.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	23	50	And a man named Joseph, who was a member of the Council, a good and righteous man	42
NASB	Luke	23	51	(he had not consented to their plan and action), a man from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who was waiting for the kingdom of God;	42
NASB	Luke	23	52	This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.	42
NASB	Luke	23	53	And he took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid Him in a tomb cut into the rock, where no one had ever lain.	42
NASB	Luke	23	54	It was the preparation day, and the Sabbath was about to begin.	42
NASB	Luke	23	55	Now the women who had come with Him out of Galilee followed, and saw the tomb and how His body was laid.	42
NASB	Luke	23	56	Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes. And on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.	42
NASB	Luke	23	6	When Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.	42
NASB	Luke	23	7	And when he learned that He belonged to Herod&rsquo;s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who himself also was in Jerusalem at that time.	42
NASB	Luke	23	8	Now Herod was very glad when he saw Jesus; for he had wanted to see Him for a long time, because he had been hearing about Him and was hoping to see some sign performed by Him.	42
NASB	Luke	23	9	And he questioned Him at some length; but He answered him nothing.	42
NASB	Luke	24	1	But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared.	42
NASB	Luke	24	10	Now they were Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James; also the other women with them were telling these things to the apostles.	42
NASB	Luke	24	11	But these words appeared to them as nonsense, and they would not believe them.	42
NASB	Luke	24	12	But Peter got up and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen wrappings only; and he went away to his home, marveling at what had happened.	42
NASB	Luke	24	13	And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem.	42
NASB	Luke	24	14	And they were talking with each other about all these things which had taken place.	42
NASB	Luke	24	15	While they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself approached and began traveling with them.	42
NASB	Luke	24	16	But their eyes were prevented from recognizing Him.	42
NASB	Luke	24	17	And He said to them, &ldquo;What are these words that you are exchanging with one another as you are walking?&rdquo; And they stood still, looking sad.	42
NASB	Luke	24	18	One of them, named Cleopas, answered and said to Him, &ldquo;Are You the only one visiting Jerusalem and unaware of the things which have happened here in these days?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	24	19	And He said to them, &ldquo;What things?&rdquo; And they said to Him, &ldquo;The things about Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word in the sight of God and all the people,	42
NASB	Luke	24	2	And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb,	42
NASB	Luke	24	20	And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to the sentence of death, and crucified Him.	42
NASB	Luke	24	21	&ldquo;But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, it is the third day since these things happened.	42
NASB	Luke	24	22	&ldquo;But also some women among us amazed us. When they were at the tomb early in the morning,	42
NASB	Luke	24	23	And did not find His body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive.	42
NASB	Luke	24	24	&ldquo;Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just exactly as the women also had said; but Him they did not see.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	24	25	And He said to them, &ldquo;O foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!	42
NASB	Luke	24	26	&ldquo;Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	24	27	Then beginning with Moses and with all the prophets, He explained to them the things concerning Himself in all the Scriptures.	42
NASB	Luke	24	28	And they approached the village where they were going, and He acted as though He were going farther.	42
NASB	Luke	24	29	But they urged Him, saying, &ldquo;Stay with us, for it is getting toward evening, and the day is now nearly over.&rdquo; So He went in to stay with them.	42
NASB	Luke	24	3	But when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.	42
NASB	Luke	24	30	When He had reclined at the table with them, He took the bread and blessed it, and breaking it, He began giving it to them.	42
NASB	Luke	24	31	Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Him; and He vanished from their sight.	42
NASB	Luke	24	32	They said to one another, &ldquo;Were not our hearts burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was explaining the Scriptures to us?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	24	33	And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found gathered together the eleven and those who were with them,	42
NASB	Luke	24	34	Saying, &ldquo;The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	24	35	They began to relate their experiences on the road and how He was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.	42
NASB	Luke	24	36	While they were telling these things, He Himself stood in their midst and said to them, &ldquo;Peace be to you.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	24	37	But they were startled and frightened and thought that they were seeing a spirit.	42
NASB	Luke	24	38	And He said to them, &ldquo;Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?	42
NASB	Luke	24	39	&ldquo;See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; touch Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	24	4	While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men suddenly stood near them in dazzling clothing;	42
NASB	Luke	24	40	And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet.	42
NASB	Luke	24	41	While they still could not believe it because of their joy and amazement, He said to them, &ldquo;Have you anything here to eat?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	24	42	They gave Him a piece of a broiled fish;	42
NASB	Luke	24	43	And He took it and ate it before them.	42
NASB	Luke	24	44	Now He said to them, &ldquo;These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	24	45	Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,	42
NASB	Luke	24	46	And He said to them, &ldquo;Thus it is written, that the Christ would suffer and rise again from the dead the third day,	42
NASB	Luke	24	47	And that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.	42
NASB	Luke	24	48	&ldquo;You are witnesses of these things.	42
NASB	Luke	24	49	&ldquo;And behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you; but you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	24	5	And as the women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, &ldquo;Why do you seek the living One among the dead?	42
NASB	Luke	24	50	And He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them.	42
NASB	Luke	24	51	While He was blessing them, He parted from them and was carried up into heaven.	42
NASB	Luke	24	52	And they, after worshiping Him, returned to Jerusalem with great joy,	42
NASB	Luke	24	53	And were continually in the temple praising God.	42
NASB	Luke	24	6	&ldquo;He is not here, but He has risen. Remember how He spoke to you while He was still in Galilee,	42
NASB	Luke	24	7	Saying that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	24	8	And they remembered His words,	42
NASB	Luke	24	9	And returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.	42
NASB	Luke	3	1	Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene,	42
NASB	Luke	3	10	And the crowds were questioning him, saying, &ldquo;Then what shall we do?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	3	11	And he would answer and say to them, &ldquo;The man who has two tunics is to share with him who has none; and he who has food is to do likewise.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	3	12	And some tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, &ldquo;Teacher, what shall we do?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	3	13	And he said to them, &ldquo;Collect no more than what you have been ordered to.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	3	14	Some soldiers were questioning him, saying, &ldquo;And what about us, what shall we do?&rdquo; And he said to them, &ldquo;Do not take money from anyone by force, or accuse anyone falsely, and be content with your wages.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	3	15	Now while the people were in a state of expectation and all were wondering in their hearts about John, as to whether he was the Christ,	42
NASB	Luke	3	16	John answered and said to them all, &ldquo;As for me, I baptize you with water; but One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to untie the thong of His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.	42
NASB	Luke	3	17	&ldquo;His winnowing fork is in His hand to thoroughly clear His threshing floor, and to gather the wheat into His barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	3	18	So with many other exhortations he preached the gospel to the people.	42
NASB	Luke	3	19	But when Herod the tetrarch was reprimanded by him because of Herodias, his brother&rsquo;s wife, and because of all the wicked things which Herod had done,	42
NASB	Luke	3	2	In the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness.	42
NASB	Luke	3	20	Herod also added this to them all: he locked John up in prison.	42
NASB	Luke	3	21	Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus was also baptized, and while He was praying, heaven was opened,	42
NASB	Luke	3	22	And the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in bodily form like a dove, and a voice came out of heaven, &ldquo;You are My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	3	23	When He began His ministry, Jesus Himself was about thirty years of age, being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph, the son of Eli,	42
NASB	Luke	3	24	The son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,	42
NASB	Luke	3	25	The son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Hesli, the son of Naggai,	42
NASB	Luke	3	26	The son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda,	42
NASB	Luke	3	27	The son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,	42
NASB	Luke	3	28	The son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,	42
NASB	Luke	3	29	The son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,	42
NASB	Luke	3	3	And he came into all the district around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins;	42
NASB	Luke	3	30	The son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,	42
NASB	Luke	3	31	The son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,	42
NASB	Luke	3	32	The son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,	42
NASB	Luke	3	33	The son of Amminadab, the son of Admin, the son of Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,	42
NASB	Luke	3	34	The son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,	42
NASB	Luke	3	35	The son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Heber, the son of Shelah,	42
NASB	Luke	3	36	The son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,	42
NASB	Luke	3	37	The son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan,	42
NASB	Luke	3	38	The son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.	42
NASB	Luke	3	4	As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, &ldquo;THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, &lsquo;MAKE READY THE WAY OF THE LORD, MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT.	42
NASB	Luke	3	5	&lsquo;EVERY RAVINE WILL BE FILLED, AND EVERY MOUNTAIN AND HILL WILL BE BROUGHT LOW; THE CROOKED WILL BECOME STRAIGHT, AND THE ROUGH ROADS SMOOTH;	42
NASB	Luke	3	6	AND ALL FLESH WILL SEE THE SALVATION OF GOD.&rsquo;&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	3	7	So he began saying to the crowds who were going out to be baptized by him, &ldquo;You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?	42
NASB	Luke	3	8	&ldquo;Therefore bear fruits in keeping with repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, &lsquo;We have Abraham for our father,&rsquo; for I say to you that from these stones God is able to raise up children to Abraham.	42
NASB	Luke	3	9	&ldquo;Indeed the axe is already laid at the root of the trees; so every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	4	1	Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led around by the Spirit in the wilderness	42
NASB	Luke	4	10	For it is written, &lsquo;HE WILL COMMAND HIS ANGELS CONCERNING YOU TO GUARD YOU,&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	4	11	And, &lsquo;ON their HANDS THEY WILL BEAR YOU UP, SO THAT YOU WILL NOT STRIKE YOUR FOOT AGAINST A STONE.&rsquo;&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	4	12	And Jesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;It is said, &lsquo;YOU SHALL NOT PUT THE LORD YOUR GOD TO THE TEST.&rsquo;&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	4	13	When the devil had finished every temptation, he left Him until an opportune time.	42
NASB	Luke	4	14	And Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about Him spread through all the surrounding district.	42
NASB	Luke	4	15	And He began teaching in their synagogues and was praised by all.	42
NASB	Luke	4	16	And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up; and as was His custom, He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath, and stood up to read.	42
NASB	Luke	4	17	And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him. And He opened the book and found the place where it was written,	42
NASB	Luke	4	18	&ldquo;THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME, BECAUSE HE ANOINTED ME TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THE POOR. HE HAS SENT ME TO PROCLAIM RELEASE TO THE CAPTIVES, AND RECOVERY OF SIGHT TO THE BLIND, TO SET FREE THOSE WHO ARE OPPRESSED,	42
NASB	Luke	4	19	TO PROCLAIM THE FAVORABLE YEAR OF THE LORD.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	4	2	For forty days, being tempted by the devil. And He ate nothing during those days, and when they had ended, He became hungry.	42
NASB	Luke	4	20	And He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on Him.	42
NASB	Luke	4	21	And He began to say to them, &ldquo;Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	4	22	And all were speaking well of Him, and wondering at the gracious words which were falling from His lips; and they were saying, &ldquo;Is this not Joseph&rsquo;s son?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	4	23	And He said to them, &ldquo;No doubt you will quote this proverb to Me, &lsquo;Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we heard was done at Capernaum, do here in your hometown as well.&rsquo;&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	4	24	And He said, &ldquo;Truly I say to you, no prophet is welcome in his hometown.	42
NASB	Luke	4	25	&ldquo;But I say to you in truth, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land;	42
NASB	Luke	4	26	And yet Elijah was sent to none of them, but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.	42
NASB	Luke	4	27	&ldquo;And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	4	28	And all the people in the synagogue were filled with rage as they heard these things;	42
NASB	Luke	4	29	And they got up and drove Him out of the city, and led Him to the brow of the hill on which their city had been built, in order to throw Him down the cliff.	42
NASB	Luke	4	3	And the devil said to Him, &ldquo;If You are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	4	30	But passing through their midst, He went His way.	42
NASB	Luke	4	31	And He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and He was teaching them on the Sabbath;	42
NASB	Luke	4	32	And they were amazed at His teaching, for His message was with authority.	42
NASB	Luke	4	33	In the synagogue there was a man possessed by the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,	42
NASB	Luke	4	34	&ldquo;Let us alone! What business do we have with each other, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are&mdash;the Holy One of God!&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	4	35	But Jesus rebuked him, saying, &ldquo;Be quiet and come out of him!&rdquo; And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst of the people, he came out of him without doing him any harm.	42
NASB	Luke	4	36	And amazement came upon them all, and they began talking with one another saying, &ldquo;What is this message? For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits and they come out.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	4	37	And the report about Him was spreading into every locality in the surrounding district.	42
NASB	Luke	4	38	Then He got up and left the synagogue, and entered Simon&rsquo;s home. Now Simon&rsquo;s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Him to help her.	42
NASB	Luke	4	39	And standing over her, He rebuked the fever, and it left her; and she immediately got up and waited on them.	42
NASB	Luke	4	4	And Jesus answered him, &ldquo;It is written, &lsquo;MAN SHALL NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE.&rsquo;&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	4	40	While the sun was setting, all those who had any who were sick with various diseases brought them to Him; and laying His hands on each one of them, He was healing them.	42
NASB	Luke	4	41	Demons also were coming out of many, shouting, &ldquo;You are the Son of God!&rdquo; But rebuking them, He would not allow them to speak, because they knew Him to be the Christ.	42
NASB	Luke	4	42	When day came, Jesus left and went to a secluded place; and the crowds were searching for Him, and came to Him and tried to keep Him from going away from them.	42
NASB	Luke	4	43	But He said to them, &ldquo;I must preach the kingdom of God to the other cities also, for I was sent for this purpose.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	4	44	So He kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea.	42
NASB	Luke	4	5	And he led Him up and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.	42
NASB	Luke	4	6	And the devil said to Him, &ldquo;I will give You all this domain and its glory; for it has been handed over to me, and I give it to whomever I wish.	42
NASB	Luke	4	7	&ldquo;Therefore if You worship before me, it shall all be Yours.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	4	8	Jesus answered him, &ldquo;It is written, &lsquo;YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD AND SERVE HIM ONLY.&rsquo;&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	4	9	And he led Him to Jerusalem and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, &ldquo;If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here;	42
NASB	Luke	5	1	Now it happened that while the crowd was pressing around Him and listening to the word of God, He was standing by the lake of Gennesaret;	42
NASB	Luke	5	10	And so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, &ldquo;Do not fear, from now on you will be catching men.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	5	11	When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed Him.	42
NASB	Luke	5	12	While He was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man covered with leprosy; and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and implored Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	5	13	And He stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, &ldquo;I am willing; be cleansed.&rdquo; And immediately the leprosy left him.	42
NASB	Luke	5	14	And He ordered him to tell no one, &ldquo;But go and show yourself to the priest and make an offering for your cleansing, just as Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	5	15	But the news about Him was spreading even farther, and large crowds were gathering to hear Him and to be healed of their sicknesses.	42
NASB	Luke	5	16	But Jesus Himself would often slip away to the wilderness and pray.	42
NASB	Luke	5	17	One day He was teaching; and there were some Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting there, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was present for Him to perform healing.	42
NASB	Luke	5	18	And some men were carrying on a bed a man who was paralyzed; and they were trying to bring him in and to set him down in front of Him.	42
NASB	Luke	5	19	But not finding any way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down through the tiles with his stretcher, into the middle of the crowd, in front of Jesus.	42
NASB	Luke	5	2	And He saw two boats lying at the edge of the lake; but the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets.	42
NASB	Luke	5	20	Seeing their faith, He said, &ldquo;Friend, your sins are forgiven you.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	5	21	The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, &ldquo;Who is this man who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	5	22	But Jesus, aware of their reasonings, answered and said to them, &ldquo;Why are you reasoning in your hearts?	42
NASB	Luke	5	23	&ldquo;Which is easier, to say, &lsquo;Your sins have been forgiven you,&rsquo; or to say, &lsquo;Get up and walk&rsquo;?	42
NASB	Luke	5	24	&ldquo;But, so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,&rdquo;&mdash;He said to the paralytic&mdash;&ldquo;I say to you, get up, and pick up your stretcher and go home.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	5	25	Immediately he got up before them, and picked up what he had been lying on, and went home glorifying God.	42
NASB	Luke	5	26	They were all struck with astonishment and began glorifying God; and they were filled with fear, saying, &ldquo;We have seen remarkable things today.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	5	27	After that He went out and noticed a tax collector named Levi sitting in the tax booth, and He said to him, &ldquo;Follow Me.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	5	28	And he left everything behind, and got up and began to follow Him.	42
NASB	Luke	5	29	And Levi gave a big reception for Him in his house; and there was a great crowd of tax collectors and other people who were reclining at the table with them.	42
NASB	Luke	5	3	And He got into one of the boats, which was Simon&rsquo;s, and asked him to put out a little way from the land. And He sat down and began teaching the people from the boat.	42
NASB	Luke	5	30	The Pharisees and their scribes began grumbling at His disciples, saying, &ldquo;Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	5	31	And Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;It is not those who are well who need a physician, but those who are sick.	42
NASB	Luke	5	32	&ldquo;I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	5	33	And they said to Him, &ldquo;The disciples of John often fast and offer prayers, the disciples of the Pharisees also do the same, but Yours eat and drink.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	5	34	And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;You cannot make the attendants of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them, can you?	42
NASB	Luke	5	35	&ldquo;But the days will come; and when the bridegroom is taken away from them, then they will fast in those days.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	5	36	And He was also telling them a parable: &ldquo;No one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and puts it on an old garment; otherwise he will both tear the new, and the piece from the new will not match the old.	42
NASB	Luke	5	37	&ldquo;And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled out, and the skins will be ruined.	42
NASB	Luke	5	38	&ldquo;But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.	42
NASB	Luke	5	39	&ldquo;And no one, after drinking old wine wishes for new; for he says, &lsquo;The old is good enough.&rsquo;&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	5	4	When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, &ldquo;Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	5	5	Simon answered and said, &ldquo;Master, we worked hard all night and caught nothing, but I will do as You say and let down the nets.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	5	6	When they had done this, they enclosed a great quantity of fish, and their nets began to break;	42
NASB	Luke	5	7	So they signaled to their partners in the other boat for them to come and help them. And they came and filled both of the boats, so that they began to sink.	42
NASB	Luke	5	8	But when Simon Peter saw that, he fell down at Jesus&rsquo; feet, saying, &ldquo;Go away from me Lord, for I am a sinful man!&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	5	9	For amazement had seized him and all his companions because of the catch of fish which they had taken;	42
NASB	Luke	6	1	Now it happened that He was passing through some grainfields on a Sabbath; and His disciples were picking the heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands, and eating the grain.	42
NASB	Luke	6	10	After looking around at them all, He said to him, &ldquo;Stretch out your hand!&rdquo; And he did so; and his hand was restored.	42
NASB	Luke	6	11	But they themselves were filled with rage, and discussed together what they might do to Jesus.	42
NASB	Luke	6	12	It was at this time that He went off to the mountain to pray, and He spent the whole night in prayer to God.	42
NASB	Luke	6	13	And when day came, He called His disciples to Him and chose twelve of them, whom He also named as apostles:	42
NASB	Luke	6	14	Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James and John; and Philip and Bartholomew;	42
NASB	Luke	6	15	And Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot;	42
NASB	Luke	6	16	Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.	42
NASB	Luke	6	17	Jesus came down with them and stood on a level place; and there was a large crowd of His disciples, and a great throng of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon,	42
NASB	Luke	6	18	Who had come to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases; and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were being cured.	42
NASB	Luke	6	19	And all the people were trying to touch Him, for power was coming from Him and healing them all.	42
NASB	Luke	6	2	But some of the Pharisees said, &ldquo;Why do you do what is not lawful on the Sabbath?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	6	20	And turning His gaze toward His disciples, He began to say, &ldquo;Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.	42
NASB	Luke	6	21	&ldquo;Blessed are you who hunger now, for you shall be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh.	42
NASB	Luke	6	22	&ldquo;Blessed are you when men hate you, and ostracize you, and insult you, and scorn your name as evil, for the sake of the Son of Man.	42
NASB	Luke	6	23	&ldquo;Be glad in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven. For in the same way their fathers used to treat the prophets.	42
NASB	Luke	6	24	&ldquo;But woe to you who are rich, for you are receiving your comfort in full.	42
NASB	Luke	6	25	&ldquo;Woe to you who are well-fed now, for you shall be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep.	42
NASB	Luke	6	26	&ldquo;Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for their fathers used to treat the false prophets in the same way.	42
NASB	Luke	6	27	&ldquo;But I say to you who hear, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,	42
NASB	Luke	6	28	Bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.	42
NASB	Luke	6	29	&ldquo;Whoever hits you on the cheek, offer him the other also; and whoever takes away your coat, do not withhold your shirt from him either.	42
NASB	Luke	6	3	And Jesus answering them said, &ldquo;Have you not even read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him,	42
NASB	Luke	6	30	&ldquo;Give to everyone who asks of you, and whoever takes away what is yours, do not demand it back.	42
NASB	Luke	6	31	&ldquo;Treat others the same way you want them to treat you.	42
NASB	Luke	6	32	&ldquo;If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.	42
NASB	Luke	6	33	&ldquo;If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.	42
NASB	Luke	6	34	&ldquo;If you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners in order to receive back the same amount.	42
NASB	Luke	6	35	&ldquo;But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High; for He Himself is kind to ungrateful and evil men.	42
NASB	Luke	6	36	&ldquo;Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.	42
NASB	Luke	6	37	&ldquo;Do not judge, and you will not be judged; and do not condemn, and you will not be condemned; pardon, and you will be pardoned.	42
NASB	Luke	6	38	&ldquo;Give, and it will be given to you. They will pour into your lap a good measure&mdash;pressed down, shaken together, and running over. For by your standard of measure it will be measured to you in return.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	6	39	And He also spoke a parable to them: &ldquo;A blind man cannot guide a blind man, can he? Will they not both fall into a pit?	42
NASB	Luke	6	4	How he entered the house of God, and took and ate the consecrated bread which is not lawful for any to eat except the priests alone, and gave it to his companions?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	6	40	&ldquo;A pupil is not above his teacher; but everyone, after he has been fully trained, will be like his teacher.	42
NASB	Luke	6	41	&ldquo;Why do you look at the speck that is in your brother&rsquo;s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?	42
NASB	Luke	6	42	&ldquo;Or how can you say to your brother, &lsquo;Brother, let me take out the speck that is in your eye,&rsquo; when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother&rsquo;s eye.	42
NASB	Luke	6	43	&ldquo;For there is no good tree which produces bad fruit, nor, on the other hand, a bad tree which produces good fruit.	42
NASB	Luke	6	44	&ldquo;For each tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they pick grapes from a briar bush.	42
NASB	Luke	6	45	&ldquo;The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good; and the evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth what is evil; for his mouth speaks from that which fills his heart.	42
NASB	Luke	6	46	&ldquo;Why do you call Me, &lsquo;Lord, Lord,&rsquo; and do not do what I say?	42
NASB	Luke	6	47	&ldquo;Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and acts on them, I will show you whom he is like:	42
NASB	Luke	6	48	He is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock; and when a flood occurred, the torrent burst against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built.	42
NASB	Luke	6	49	&ldquo;But the one who has heard and has not acted accordingly, is like a man who built a house on the ground without any foundation; and the torrent burst against it and immediately it collapsed, and the ruin of that house was great.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	6	5	And He was saying to them, &ldquo;The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	6	6	On another Sabbath He entered the synagogue and was teaching; and there was a man there whose right hand was withered.	42
NASB	Luke	6	7	The scribes and the Pharisees were watching Him closely to see if He healed on the Sabbath, so that they might find reason to accuse Him.	42
NASB	Luke	6	8	But He knew what they were thinking, and He said to the man with the withered hand, &ldquo;Get up and come forward!&rdquo; And he got up and came forward.	42
NASB	Luke	6	9	And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;I ask you, is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath, to save a life or to destroy it?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	7	1	When He had completed all His discourse in the hearing of the people, He went to Capernaum.	42
NASB	Luke	7	10	When those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave in good health.	42
NASB	Luke	7	11	Soon afterwards He went to a city called Nain; and His disciples were going along with Him, accompanied by a large crowd.	42
NASB	Luke	7	12	Now as He approached the gate of the city, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a sizeable crowd from the city was with her.	42
NASB	Luke	7	13	When the Lord saw her, He felt compassion for her, and said to her, &ldquo;Do not weep.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	7	14	And He came up and touched the coffin; and the bearers came to a halt. And He said, &ldquo;Young man, I say to you, arise!&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	7	15	The dead man sat up and began to speak. And Jesus gave him back to his mother.	42
NASB	Luke	7	16	Fear gripped them all, and they began glorifying God, saying, &ldquo;A great prophet has arisen among us!&rdquo; and, &ldquo;God has visited His people!&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	7	17	This report concerning Him went out all over Judea and in all the surrounding district.	42
NASB	Luke	7	18	The disciples of John reported to him about all these things.	42
NASB	Luke	7	19	Summoning two of his disciples, John sent them to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Are You the Expected One, or do we look for someone else?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	7	2	And a centurion&rsquo;s slave, who was highly regarded by him, was sick and about to die.	42
NASB	Luke	7	20	When the men came to Him, they said, &ldquo;John the Baptist has sent us to You, to ask, &lsquo;Are You the Expected One, or do we look for someone else?&rsquo;&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	7	21	At that very time He cured many people of diseases and afflictions and evil spirits; and He gave sight to many who were blind.	42
NASB	Luke	7	22	And He answered and said to them, &ldquo;Go and report to John what you have seen and heard: the BLIND RECEIVE SIGHT, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the POOR HAVE THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO THEM.	42
NASB	Luke	7	23	&ldquo;Blessed is he who does not take offense at Me.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	7	24	When the messengers of John had left, He began to speak to the crowds about John, &ldquo;What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?	42
NASB	Luke	7	25	&ldquo;But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Those who are splendidly clothed and live in luxury are found in royal palaces!	42
NASB	Luke	7	26	&ldquo;But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and one who is more than a prophet.	42
NASB	Luke	7	27	&ldquo;This is the one about whom it is written, &lsquo;BEHOLD, I SEND MY MESSENGER AHEAD OF YOU, WHO WILL PREPARE YOUR WAY BEFORE YOU.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	7	28	&ldquo;I say to you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	7	29	When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they acknowledged God&rsquo;s justice, having been baptized with the baptism of John.	42
NASB	Luke	7	3	When he heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders asking Him to come and save the life of his slave.	42
NASB	Luke	7	30	But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected God&rsquo;s purpose for themselves, not having been baptized by John.	42
NASB	Luke	7	31	&ldquo;To what then shall I compare the men of this generation, and what are they like?	42
NASB	Luke	7	32	&ldquo;They are like children who sit in the market place and call to one another, and they say, &lsquo;We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	7	33	&ldquo;For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, &lsquo;He has a demon!&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	7	34	&ldquo;The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, &lsquo;Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!&rsquo;	42
NASB	Luke	7	35	&ldquo;Yet wisdom is vindicated by all her children.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	7	36	Now one of the Pharisees was requesting Him to dine with him, and He entered the Pharisee&rsquo;s house and reclined at the table.	42
NASB	Luke	7	37	And there was a woman in the city who was a sinner; and when she learned that He was reclining at the table in the Pharisee&rsquo;s house, she brought an alabaster vial of perfume,	42
NASB	Luke	7	38	And standing behind Him at His feet, weeping, she began to wet His feet with her tears, and kept wiping them with the hair of her head, and kissing His feet and anointing them with the perfume.	42
NASB	Luke	7	39	Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he said to himself, &ldquo;If this man were a prophet He would know who and what sort of person this woman is who is touching Him, that she is a sinner.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	7	4	When they came to Jesus, they earnestly implored Him, saying, &ldquo;He is worthy for You to grant this to him;	42
NASB	Luke	7	40	And Jesus answered him, &ldquo;Simon, I have something to say to you.&rdquo; And he replied, &ldquo;Say it, Teacher.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	7	41	&ldquo;A moneylender had two debtors: one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.	42
NASB	Luke	7	42	&ldquo;When they were unable to repay, he graciously forgave them both. So which of them will love him more?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	7	43	Simon answered and said, &ldquo;I suppose the one whom he forgave more.&rdquo; And He said to him, &ldquo;You have judged correctly.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	7	44	Turning toward the woman, He said to Simon, &ldquo;Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.	42
NASB	Luke	7	45	&ldquo;You gave Me no kiss; but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss My feet.	42
NASB	Luke	7	46	&ldquo;You did not anoint My head with oil, but she anointed My feet with perfume.	42
NASB	Luke	7	47	&ldquo;For this reason I say to you, her sins, which are many, have been forgiven, for she loved much; but he who is forgiven little, loves little.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	7	48	Then He said to her, &ldquo;Your sins have been forgiven.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	7	49	Those who were reclining at the table with Him began to say to themselves, &ldquo;Who is this man who even forgives sins?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	7	5	For he loves our nation and it was he who built us our synagogue.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	7	50	And He said to the woman, &ldquo;Your faith has saved you; go in peace.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	7	6	Now Jesus started on His way with them; and when He was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to Him, &ldquo;Lord, do not trouble Yourself further, for I am not worthy for You to come under my roof;	42
NASB	Luke	7	7	For this reason I did not even consider myself worthy to come to You, but just say the word, and my servant will be healed.	42
NASB	Luke	7	8	&ldquo;For I also am a man placed under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to this one, &lsquo;Go!&rsquo; and he goes, and to another, &lsquo;Come!&rsquo; and he comes, and to my slave, &lsquo;Do this!&rsquo; and he does it.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	7	9	Now when Jesus heard this, He marveled at him, and turned and said to the crowd that was following Him, &ldquo;I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	8	1	Soon afterwards, He began going around from one city and village to another, proclaiming and preaching the kingdom of God. The twelve were with Him,	42
NASB	Luke	8	10	And He said, &ldquo;To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest it is in parables, so that SEEING THEY MAY NOT SEE, AND HEARING THEY MAY NOT UNDERSTAND.	42
NASB	Luke	8	11	&ldquo;Now the parable is this: the seed is the word of God.	42
NASB	Luke	8	12	&ldquo;Those beside the road are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they will not believe and be saved.	42
NASB	Luke	8	13	&ldquo;Those on the rocky soil are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no firm root; they believe for a while, and in time of temptation fall away.	42
NASB	Luke	8	14	&ldquo;The seed which fell among the thorns, these are the ones who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with worries and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to maturity.	42
NASB	Luke	8	15	&ldquo;But the seed in the good soil, these are the ones who have heard the word in an honest and good heart, and hold it fast, and bear fruit with perseverance.	42
NASB	Luke	8	16	&ldquo;Now no one after lighting a lamp covers it over with a container, or puts it under a bed; but he puts it on a lampstand, so that those who come in may see the light.	42
NASB	Luke	8	17	&ldquo;For nothing is hidden that will not become evident, nor anything secret that will not be known and come to light.	42
NASB	Luke	8	18	&ldquo;So take care how you listen; for whoever has, to him more shall be given; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	8	19	And His mother and brothers came to Him, and they were unable to get to Him because of the crowd.	42
NASB	Luke	8	2	And also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and sicknesses: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,	42
NASB	Luke	8	20	And it was reported to Him, &ldquo;Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, wishing to see You.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	8	21	But He answered and said to them, &ldquo;My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	8	22	Now on one of those days Jesus and His disciples got into a boat, and He said to them, &ldquo;Let us go over to the other side of the lake.&rdquo; So they launched out.	42
NASB	Luke	8	23	But as they were sailing along He fell asleep; and a fierce gale of wind descended on the lake, and they began to be swamped and to be in danger.	42
NASB	Luke	8	24	They came to Jesus and woke Him up, saying, &ldquo;Master, Master, we are perishing!&rdquo; And He got up and rebuked the wind and the surging waves, and they stopped, and it became calm.	42
NASB	Luke	8	25	And He said to them, &ldquo;Where is your faith?&rdquo; They were fearful and amazed, saying to one another, &ldquo;Who then is this, that He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey Him?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	8	26	Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.	42
NASB	Luke	8	27	And when He came out onto the land, He was met by a man from the city who was possessed with demons; and who had not put on any clothing for a long time, and was not living in a house, but in the tombs.	42
NASB	Luke	8	28	Seeing Jesus, he cried out and fell before Him, and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;What business do we have with each other, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	8	29	For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had seized him many times; and he was bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard, and yet he would break his bonds and be driven by the demon into the desert.	42
NASB	Luke	8	3	And Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod&rsquo;s steward, and Susanna, and many others who were contributing to their support out of their private means.	42
NASB	Luke	8	30	And Jesus asked him, &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Legion&rdquo;; for many demons had entered him.	42
NASB	Luke	8	31	They were imploring Him not to command them to go away into the abyss.	42
NASB	Luke	8	32	Now there was a herd of many swine feeding there on the mountain; and the demons implored Him to permit them to enter the swine. And He gave them permission.	42
NASB	Luke	8	33	And the demons came out of the man and entered the swine; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.	42
NASB	Luke	8	34	When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they ran away and reported it in the city and out in the country.	42
NASB	Luke	8	35	The people went out to see what had happened; and they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting down at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they became frightened.	42
NASB	Luke	8	36	Those who had seen it reported to them how the man who was demon-possessed had been made well.	42
NASB	Luke	8	37	And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes and the surrounding district asked Him to leave them, for they were gripped with great fear; and He got into a boat and returned.	42
NASB	Luke	8	38	But the man from whom the demons had gone out was begging Him that he might accompany Him; but He sent him away, saying,	42
NASB	Luke	8	39	&ldquo;Return to your house and describe what great things God has done for you.&rdquo; So he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.	42
NASB	Luke	8	4	When a large crowd was coming together, and those from the various cities were journeying to Him, He spoke by way of a parable:	42
NASB	Luke	8	40	And as Jesus returned, the people welcomed Him, for they had all been waiting for Him.	42
NASB	Luke	8	41	And there came a man named Jairus, and he was an official of the synagogue; and he fell at Jesus&rsquo; feet, and began to implore Him to come to his house;	42
NASB	Luke	8	42	For he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. But as He went, the crowds were pressing against Him.	42
NASB	Luke	8	43	And a woman who had a hemorrhage for twelve years, and could not be healed by anyone,	42
NASB	Luke	8	44	Came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His cloak, and immediately her hemorrhage stopped.	42
NASB	Luke	8	45	And Jesus said, &ldquo;Who is the one who touched Me?&rdquo; And while they were all denying it, Peter said, &ldquo;Master, the people are crowding and pressing in on You.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	8	46	But Jesus said, &ldquo;Someone did touch Me, for I was aware that power had gone out of Me.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	8	47	When the woman saw that she had not escaped notice, she came trembling and fell down before Him, and declared in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched Him, and how she had been immediately healed.	42
NASB	Luke	8	48	And He said to her, &ldquo;Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	8	49	While He was still speaking, someone came from the house of the synagogue official, saying, &ldquo;Your daughter has died; do not trouble the Teacher anymore.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	8	5	&ldquo;The sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell beside the road, and it was trampled under foot and the birds of the air ate it up.	42
NASB	Luke	8	50	But when Jesus heard this, He answered him, &ldquo;Do not be afraid any longer; only believe, and she will be made well.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	8	51	When He came to the house, He did not allow anyone to enter with Him, except Peter and John and James, and the girl&rsquo;s father and mother.	42
NASB	Luke	8	52	Now they were all weeping and lamenting for her; but He said, &ldquo;Stop weeping, for she has not died, but is asleep.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	8	53	And they began laughing at Him, knowing that she had died.	42
NASB	Luke	8	54	He, however, took her by the hand and called, saying, &ldquo;Child, arise!&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	8	55	And her spirit returned, and she got up immediately; and He gave orders for something to be given her to eat.	42
NASB	Luke	8	56	Her parents were amazed; but He instructed them to tell no one what had happened.	42
NASB	Luke	8	6	&ldquo;Other seed fell on rocky soil, and as soon as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture.	42
NASB	Luke	8	7	&ldquo;Other seed fell among the thorns; and the thorns grew up with it and choked it out.	42
NASB	Luke	8	8	&ldquo;Other seed fell into the good soil, and grew up, and produced a crop a hundred times as great.&rdquo; As He said these things, He would call out, &ldquo;He who has ears to hear, let him hear.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	8	9	His disciples began questioning Him as to what this parable meant.	42
NASB	Luke	9	1	And He called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to heal diseases.	42
NASB	Luke	9	10	When the apostles returned, they gave an account to Him of all that they had done. Taking them with Him, He withdrew by Himself to a city called Bethsaida.	42
NASB	Luke	9	11	But the crowds were aware of this and followed Him; and welcoming them, He began speaking to them about the kingdom of God and curing those who had need of healing.	42
NASB	Luke	9	12	Now the day was ending, and the twelve came and said to Him, &ldquo;Send the crowd away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside and find lodging and get something to eat; for here we are in a desolate place.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	9	13	But He said to them, &ldquo;You give them something to eat!&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless perhaps we go and buy food for all these people.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	9	14	(For there were about five thousand men.) And He said to His disciples, &ldquo;Have them sit down to eat in groups of about fifty each.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	9	15	They did so, and had them all sit down.	42
NASB	Luke	9	16	Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed them, and broke them, and kept giving them to the disciples to set before the people.	42
NASB	Luke	9	17	And they all ate and were satisfied; and the broken pieces which they had left over were picked up, twelve baskets full.	42
NASB	Luke	9	18	And it happened that while He was praying alone, the disciples were with Him, and He questioned them, saying, &ldquo;Who do the people say that I am?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	9	19	They answered and said, &ldquo;John the Baptist, and others say Elijah; but others, that one of the prophets of old has risen again.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	9	2	And He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to perform healing.	42
NASB	Luke	9	20	And He said to them, &ldquo;But who do you say that I am?&rdquo; And Peter answered and said, &ldquo;The Christ of God.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	9	21	But He warned them and instructed them not to tell this to anyone,	42
NASB	Luke	9	22	Saying, &ldquo;The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed and be raised up on the third day.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	9	23	And He was saying to them all, &ldquo;If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross daily and follow Me.	42
NASB	Luke	9	24	&ldquo;For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake, he is the one who will save it.	42
NASB	Luke	9	25	&ldquo;For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits himself?	42
NASB	Luke	9	26	&ldquo;For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory, and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.	42
NASB	Luke	9	27	&ldquo;But I say to you truthfully, there are some of those standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	9	28	Some eight days after these sayings, He took along Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray.	42
NASB	Luke	9	29	And while He was praying, the appearance of His face became different, and His clothing became white and gleaming.	42
NASB	Luke	9	3	And He said to them, &ldquo;Take nothing for your journey, neither a staff, nor a bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not even have two tunics apiece.	42
NASB	Luke	9	30	And behold, two men were talking with Him; and they were Moses and Elijah,	42
NASB	Luke	9	31	Who, appearing in glory, were speaking of His departure which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.	42
NASB	Luke	9	32	Now Peter and his companions had been overcome with sleep; but when they were fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men standing with Him.	42
NASB	Luke	9	33	And as these were leaving Him, Peter said to Jesus, &ldquo;Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles: one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah&rdquo;&mdash;not realizing what he was saying.	42
NASB	Luke	9	34	While he was saying this, a cloud formed and began to overshadow them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.	42
NASB	Luke	9	35	Then a voice came out of the cloud, saying, &ldquo;This is My Son, My Chosen One; listen to Him!&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	9	36	And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent, and reported to no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.	42
NASB	Luke	9	37	On the next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met Him.	42
NASB	Luke	9	38	And a man from the crowd shouted, saying, &ldquo;Teacher, I beg You to look at my son, for he is my only boy,	42
NASB	Luke	9	39	And a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly screams, and it throws him into a convulsion with foaming at the mouth; and only with difficulty does it leave him, mauling him as it leaves.	42
NASB	Luke	9	4	&ldquo;Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that city.	42
NASB	Luke	9	40	&ldquo;I begged Your disciples to cast it out, and they could not.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	9	41	And Jesus answered and said, &ldquo;You unbelieving and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	9	42	While he was still approaching, the demon slammed him to the ground and threw him into a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy and gave him back to his father.	42
NASB	Luke	9	43	And they were all amazed at the greatness of God. But while everyone was marveling at all that He was doing, He said to His disciples,	42
NASB	Luke	9	44	&ldquo;Let these words sink into your ears; for the Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	9	45	But they did not understand this statement, and it was concealed from them so that they would not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask Him about this statement.	42
NASB	Luke	9	46	An argument started among them as to which of them might be the greatest.	42
NASB	Luke	9	47	But Jesus, knowing what they were thinking in their heart, took a child and stood him by His side,	42
NASB	Luke	9	48	And said to them, &ldquo;Whoever receives this child in My name receives Me, and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me; for the one who is least among all of you, this is the one who is great.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	9	49	John answered and said, &ldquo;Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name; and we tried to prevent him because he does not follow along with us.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	9	5	&ldquo;And as for those who do not receive you, as you go out from that city, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	9	50	But Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Do not hinder him; for he who is not against you is for you.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	9	51	When the days were approaching for His ascension, He was determined to go to Jerusalem;	42
NASB	Luke	9	52	And He sent messengers on ahead of Him, and they went and entered a village of the Samaritans to make arrangements for Him.	42
NASB	Luke	9	53	But they did not receive Him, because He was traveling toward Jerusalem.	42
NASB	Luke	9	54	When His disciples James and John saw this, they said, &ldquo;Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	9	55	But He turned and rebuked them, [and said, &ldquo;You do not know what kind of spirit you are of;	42
NASB	Luke	9	56	For the Son of Man did not come to destroy men&rsquo;s lives, but to save them.&rdquo;] And they went on to another village.	42
NASB	Luke	9	57	As they were going along the road, someone said to Him, &ldquo;I will follow You wherever You go.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	9	58	And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	9	59	And He said to another, &ldquo;Follow Me.&rdquo; But he said, &ldquo;Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	9	6	Departing, they began going throughout the villages, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.	42
NASB	Luke	9	60	But He said to him, &ldquo;Allow the dead to bury their own dead; but as for you, go and proclaim everywhere the kingdom of God.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	9	61	Another also said, &ldquo;I will follow You, Lord; but first permit me to say good-bye to those at home.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	9	62	But Jesus said to him, &ldquo;No one, after putting his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.&rdquo;	42
NASB	Luke	9	7	Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was happening; and he was greatly perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,	42
NASB	Luke	9	8	And by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the prophets of old had risen again.	42
NASB	Luke	9	9	Herod said, &ldquo;I myself had John beheaded; but who is this man about whom I hear such things?&rdquo; And he kept trying to see Him.	42
NASB	Mark	1	1	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.	41
NASB	Mark	1	10	Immediately coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens opening, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him;	41
NASB	Mark	1	11	And a voice came out of the heavens: &ldquo;You are My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	1	12	Immediately the Spirit impelled Him to go out into the wilderness.	41
NASB	Mark	1	13	And He was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by Satan; and He was with the wild beasts, and the angels were ministering to Him.	41
NASB	Mark	1	14	Now after John had been taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,	41
NASB	Mark	1	15	And saying, &ldquo;The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	1	16	As He was going along by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net in the sea; for they were fishermen.	41
NASB	Mark	1	17	And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Follow Me, and I will make you become fishers of men.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	1	18	Immediately they left their nets and followed Him.	41
NASB	Mark	1	19	Going on a little farther, He saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets.	41
NASB	Mark	1	2	As it is written in Isaiah the prophet: &ldquo;BEHOLD, I SEND MY MESSENGER AHEAD OF YOU, WHO WILL PREPARE YOUR WAY;	41
NASB	Mark	1	20	Immediately He called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went away to follow Him.	41
NASB	Mark	1	21	They went into Capernaum; and immediately on the Sabbath He entered the synagogue and began to teach.	41
NASB	Mark	1	22	They were amazed at His teaching; for He was teaching them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.	41
NASB	Mark	1	23	Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,	41
NASB	Mark	1	24	Saying, &ldquo;What business do we have with each other, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are&mdash;the Holy One of God!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	1	25	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, &ldquo;Be quiet, and come out of him!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	1	26	Throwing him into convulsions, the unclean spirit cried out with a loud voice and came out of him.	41
NASB	Mark	1	27	They were all amazed, so that they debated among themselves, saying, &ldquo;What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	1	28	Immediately the news about Him spread everywhere into all the surrounding district of Galilee.	41
NASB	Mark	1	29	And immediately after they came out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.	41
NASB	Mark	1	3	THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, &lsquo;MAKE READY THE WAY OF THE LORD, MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT.&rsquo;&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	1	30	Now Simon&rsquo;s mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever; and immediately they spoke to Jesus about her.	41
NASB	Mark	1	31	And He came to her and raised her up, taking her by the hand, and the fever left her, and she waited on them.	41
NASB	Mark	1	32	When evening came, after the sun had set, they began bringing to Him all who were ill and those who were demon-possessed.	41
NASB	Mark	1	33	And the whole city had gathered at the door.	41
NASB	Mark	1	34	And He healed many who were ill with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and He was not permitting the demons to speak, because they knew who He was.	41
NASB	Mark	1	35	In the early morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house, and went away to a secluded place, and was praying there.	41
NASB	Mark	1	36	Simon and his companions searched for Him;	41
NASB	Mark	1	37	They found Him, and said to Him, &ldquo;Everyone is looking for You.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	1	38	He said to them, &ldquo;Let us go somewhere else to the towns nearby, so that I may preach there also; for that is what I came for.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	1	39	And He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out the demons.	41
NASB	Mark	1	4	John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.	41
NASB	Mark	1	40	And a leper came to Jesus, beseeching Him and falling on his knees before Him, and saying, &ldquo;If You are willing, You can make me clean.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	1	41	Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out His hand and touched him, and said to him, &ldquo;I am willing; be cleansed.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	1	42	Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed.	41
NASB	Mark	1	43	And He sternly warned him and immediately sent him away,	41
NASB	Mark	1	44	And He said to him, &ldquo;See that you say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	1	45	But he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the news around, to such an extent that Jesus could no longer publicly enter a city, but stayed out in unpopulated areas; and they were coming to Him from everywhere.	41
NASB	Mark	1	5	And all the country of Judea was going out to him, and all the people of Jerusalem; and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.	41
NASB	Mark	1	6	John was clothed with camel&rsquo;s hair and wore a leather belt around his waist, and his diet was locusts and wild honey.	41
NASB	Mark	1	7	And he was preaching, and saying, &ldquo;After me One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to stoop down and untie the thong of His sandals.	41
NASB	Mark	1	8	&ldquo;I baptized you with water; but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	1	9	In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.	41
NASB	Mark	10	1	Getting up, He went from there to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan; crowds gathered around Him again, and, according to His custom, He once more began to teach them.	41
NASB	Mark	10	10	In the house the disciples began questioning Him about this again.	41
NASB	Mark	10	11	And He said to them, &ldquo;Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her;	41
NASB	Mark	10	12	And if she herself divorces her husband and marries another man, she is committing adultery.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	13	And they were bringing children to Him so that He might touch them; but the disciples rebuked them.	41
NASB	Mark	10	14	But when Jesus saw this, He was indignant and said to them, &ldquo;Permit the children to come to Me; do not hinder them; for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.	41
NASB	Mark	10	15	&ldquo;Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	16	And He took them in His arms and began blessing them, laying His hands on them.	41
NASB	Mark	10	17	As He was setting out on a journey, a man ran up to Him and knelt before Him, and asked Him, &ldquo;Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	18	And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Why do you call Me good? No one is good except God alone.	41
NASB	Mark	10	19	&ldquo;You know the commandments, &lsquo;DO NOT MURDER, DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY, DO NOT STEAL, DO NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS, Do not defraud, HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER.&rsquo;&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	2	Some Pharisees came up to Jesus, testing Him, and began to question Him whether it was lawful for a man to divorce a wife.	41
NASB	Mark	10	20	And he said to Him, &ldquo;Teacher, I have kept all these things from my youth up.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	21	Looking at him, Jesus felt a love for him and said to him, &ldquo;One thing you lack: go and sell all you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	22	But at these words he was saddened, and he went away grieving, for he was one who owned much property.	41
NASB	Mark	10	23	And Jesus, looking around, said to His disciples, &ldquo;How hard it will be for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	24	The disciples were amazed at His words. But Jesus answered again and said to them, &ldquo;Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!	41
NASB	Mark	10	25	&ldquo;It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	26	They were even more astonished and said to Him, &ldquo;Then who can be saved?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	27	Looking at them, Jesus said, &ldquo;With people it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	28	Peter began to say to Him, &ldquo;Behold, we have left everything and followed You.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	29	Jesus said, &ldquo;Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or farms, for My sake and for the gospel&rsquo;s sake,	41
NASB	Mark	10	3	And He answered and said to them, &ldquo;What did Moses command you?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	30	But that he will receive a hundred times as much now in the present age, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and farms, along with persecutions; and in the age to come, eternal life.	41
NASB	Mark	10	31	&ldquo;But many who are first will be last, and the last, first.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	32	They were on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking on ahead of them; and they were amazed, and those who followed were fearful. And again He took the twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to Him,	41
NASB	Mark	10	33	Saying,  &ldquo;Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death and will hand Him over to the Gentiles.	41
NASB	Mark	10	34	&ldquo;They will mock Him and spit on Him, and scourge Him and kill Him, and three days later He will rise again.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	35	James and John, the two sons of Zebedee, came up to Jesus, saying, &ldquo;Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	36	And He said to them, &ldquo;What do you want Me to do for you?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	37	They said to Him, &ldquo;Grant that we may sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your glory.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	38	But Jesus said to them, &ldquo;You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	39	They said to Him, &ldquo;We are able.&rdquo; And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;The cup that I drink you shall drink; and you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized.	41
NASB	Mark	10	4	They said, &ldquo;Moses permitted a man TO WRITE A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE AND SEND her AWAY.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	40	&ldquo;But to sit on My right or on My left, this is not Mine to give; but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	41	Hearing this, the ten began to feel indignant with James and John.	41
NASB	Mark	10	42	Calling them to Himself, Jesus said to them, &ldquo;You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great men exercise authority over them.	41
NASB	Mark	10	43	&ldquo;But it is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant;	41
NASB	Mark	10	44	And whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all.	41
NASB	Mark	10	45	&ldquo;For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	46	Then they came to Jericho. And as He was leaving Jericho with His disciples and a large crowd, a blind beggar named Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the road.	41
NASB	Mark	10	47	When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, &ldquo;Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	48	Many were sternly telling him to be quiet, but he kept crying out all the more, &ldquo;Son of David, have mercy on me!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	49	And Jesus stopped and said, &ldquo;Call him here.&rdquo; So they called the blind man, saying to him, &ldquo;Take courage, stand up! He is calling for you.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	5	But Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment.	41
NASB	Mark	10	50	Throwing aside his cloak, he jumped up and came to Jesus.	41
NASB	Mark	10	51	And answering him, Jesus said, &ldquo;What do you want Me to do for you?&rdquo; And the blind man said to Him, &ldquo;Rabboni, I want to regain my sight!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	10	52	And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Go; your faith has made you well.&rdquo; Immediately he regained his sight and began following Him on the road.	41
NASB	Mark	10	6	&ldquo;But from the beginning of creation, God MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE.	41
NASB	Mark	10	7	&ldquo;FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER,	41
NASB	Mark	10	8	AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH; so they are no longer two, but one flesh.	41
NASB	Mark	10	9	&ldquo;What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	11	1	As they approached Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, He sent two of His disciples,	41
NASB	Mark	11	10	Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David; Hosanna in the highest!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	11	11	Jesus entered Jerusalem and came into the temple; and after looking around at everything, He left for Bethany with the twelve, since it was already late.	41
NASB	Mark	11	12	On the next day, when they had left Bethany, He became hungry.	41
NASB	Mark	11	13	Seeing at a distance a fig tree in leaf, He went to see if perhaps He would find anything on it; and when He came to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.	41
NASB	Mark	11	14	He said to it, &ldquo;May no one ever eat fruit from you again!&rdquo; And His disciples were listening.	41
NASB	Mark	11	15	Then they came to Jerusalem. And He entered the temple and began to drive out those who were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves;	41
NASB	Mark	11	16	And He would not permit anyone to carry merchandise through the temple.	41
NASB	Mark	11	17	And He began to teach and say to them, &ldquo;Is it not written, &lsquo;MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER FOR ALL THE NATIONS&rsquo;? But you have made it a ROBBERs&rsquo; DEN.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	11	18	The chief priests and the scribes heard this, and began seeking how to destroy Him; for they were afraid of Him, for the whole crowd was astonished at His teaching.	41
NASB	Mark	11	19	When evening came, they would go out of the city.	41
NASB	Mark	11	2	And said to them, &ldquo;Go into the village opposite you, and immediately as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, on which no one yet has ever sat; untie it and bring it here.	41
NASB	Mark	11	20	As they were passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots up.	41
NASB	Mark	11	21	Being reminded, Peter said to Him, &ldquo;Rabbi, look, the fig tree which You cursed has withered.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	11	22	And Jesus answered saying to them, &ldquo;Have faith in God.	41
NASB	Mark	11	23	&ldquo;Truly I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, &lsquo;Be taken up and cast into the sea,&rsquo; and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is going to happen, it will be granted him.	41
NASB	Mark	11	24	&ldquo;Therefore I say to you, all things for which you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and they will be granted you.	41
NASB	Mark	11	25	&ldquo;Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you your transgressions.	41
NASB	Mark	11	26	[&ldquo;But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your transgressions.&rdquo;]	41
NASB	Mark	11	27	They came again to Jerusalem. And as He was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to Him,	41
NASB	Mark	11	28	And began saying to Him, &ldquo;By what authority are You doing these things, or who gave You this authority to do these things?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	11	29	And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;I will ask you one question, and you answer Me, and then I will tell you by what authority I do these things.	41
NASB	Mark	11	3	&ldquo;If anyone says to you, &lsquo;Why are you doing this?&rsquo; you say, &lsquo;The Lord has need of it&rsquo;; and immediately he will send it back here.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	11	30	&ldquo;Was the baptism of John from heaven, or from men? Answer Me.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	11	31	They began reasoning among themselves, saying, &ldquo;If we say, &lsquo;From heaven,&rsquo; He will say, &lsquo;Then why did you not believe him?&rsquo;	41
NASB	Mark	11	32	&ldquo;But shall we say, &lsquo;From men&rsquo;?&rdquo;&mdash;they were afraid of the people, for everyone considered John to have been a real prophet.	41
NASB	Mark	11	33	Answering Jesus, they said, &ldquo;We do not know.&rdquo; And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Nor will I tell you by what authority I do these things.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	11	4	They went away and found a colt tied at the door, outside in the street; and they untied it.	41
NASB	Mark	11	5	Some of the bystanders were saying to them, &ldquo;What are you doing, untying the colt?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	11	6	They spoke to them just as Jesus had told them, and they gave them permission.	41
NASB	Mark	11	7	They brought the colt to Jesus and put their coats on it; and He sat on it.	41
NASB	Mark	11	8	And many spread their coats in the road, and others spread leafy branches which they had cut from the fields.	41
NASB	Mark	11	9	Those who went in front and those who followed were shouting: &ldquo;Hosanna! BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD;	41
NASB	Mark	12	1	And He began to speak to them in parables: &ldquo;A man PLANTED A VINEYARD AND PUT A WALL AROUND IT, AND DUG A VAT UNDER THE WINE PRESS AND BUILT A TOWER, and rented it out to vine-growers and went on a journey.	41
NASB	Mark	12	10	&ldquo;Have you not even read this Scripture: &lsquo;THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone;	41
NASB	Mark	12	11	THIS CAME ABOUT FROM THE LORD, AND IT IS MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES&rsquo;?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	12	12	And they were seeking to seize Him, and yet they feared the people, for they understood that He spoke the parable against them. And so they left Him and went away.	41
NASB	Mark	12	13	Then they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Him in order to trap Him in a statement.	41
NASB	Mark	12	14	They came and said to Him, &ldquo;Teacher, we know that You are truthful and defer to no one; for You are not partial to any, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?	41
NASB	Mark	12	15	&ldquo;Shall we pay or shall we not pay?&rdquo; But He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, &ldquo;Why are you testing Me? Bring Me a denarius to look at.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	12	16	They brought one. And He said to them, &ldquo;Whose likeness and inscription is this?&rdquo; And they said to Him, &ldquo;Caesar&rsquo;s.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	12	17	And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar&rsquo;s, and to God the things that are God&rsquo;s.&rdquo; And they were amazed at Him.	41
NASB	Mark	12	18	Some Sadducees (who say that there is no resurrection) came to Jesus, and began questioning Him, saying,	41
NASB	Mark	12	19	&ldquo;Teacher, Moses wrote for us that IF A MAN&rsquo;s BROTHER DIES and leaves behind a wife AND LEAVES NO CHILD, HIS BROTHER SHOULD MARRY THE WIFE AND RAISE UP CHILDREN TO HIS BROTHER.	41
NASB	Mark	12	2	&ldquo;At the harvest time he sent a slave to the vine-growers, in order to receive some of the produce of the vineyard from the vine-growers.	41
NASB	Mark	12	20	&ldquo;There were seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and died leaving no children.	41
NASB	Mark	12	21	&ldquo;The second one married her, and died leaving behind no children; and the third likewise;	41
NASB	Mark	12	22	And so all seven left no children. Last of all the woman died also.	41
NASB	Mark	12	23	&ldquo;In the resurrection, when they rise again, which one&rsquo;s wife will she be? For all seven had married her.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	12	24	Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Is this not the reason you are mistaken, that you do not understand the Scriptures or the power of God?	41
NASB	Mark	12	25	&ldquo;For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.	41
NASB	Mark	12	26	&ldquo;But regarding the fact that the dead rise again, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the burning bush, how God spoke to him, saying, &lsquo;I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD OF ISAAC, and the God of Jacob&rsquo;?	41
NASB	Mark	12	27	&ldquo;He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; you are greatly mistaken.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	12	28	One of the scribes came and heard them arguing, and recognizing that He had answered them well, asked Him, &ldquo;What commandment is the foremost of all?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	12	29	Jesus answered, &ldquo;The foremost is, &lsquo;HEAR, O ISRAEL! THE LORD OUR GOD IS ONE LORD;	41
NASB	Mark	12	3	&ldquo;They took him, and beat him and sent him away empty-handed.	41
NASB	Mark	12	30	AND YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND, AND WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH.&rsquo;	41
NASB	Mark	12	31	&ldquo;The second is this, &lsquo;YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.&rsquo; There is no other commandment greater than these.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	12	32	The scribe said to Him, &ldquo;Right, Teacher; You have truly stated that HE IS ONE, AND THERE IS NO ONE ELSE BESIDES HIM;	41
NASB	Mark	12	33	AND TO LOVE HIM WITH ALL THE HEART AND WITH ALL THE UNDERSTANDING AND WITH ALL THE STRENGTH, AND TO LOVE ONE&rsquo;s NEIGHBOR AS HIMSELF, is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	12	34	When Jesus saw that he had answered intelligently, He said to him, &ldquo;You are not far from the kingdom of God.&rdquo; After that, no one would venture to ask Him any more questions.	41
NASB	Mark	12	35	And Jesus began to say, as He taught in the temple, &ldquo;How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?	41
NASB	Mark	12	36	&ldquo;David himself said in the Holy Spirit, &lsquo;THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD, &ldquo;SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I PUT YOUR ENEMIES BENEATH YOUR FEET.&rsquo;&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	12	37	&ldquo;David himself calls Him &lsquo;Lord&rsquo;; so in what sense is He his son?&rdquo; And the large crowd enjoyed listening to Him.	41
NASB	Mark	12	38	In His teaching He was saying: &ldquo;Beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes, and like respectful greetings in the market places,	41
NASB	Mark	12	39	And chief seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets,	41
NASB	Mark	12	4	&ldquo;Again he sent them another slave, and they wounded him in the head, and treated him shamefully.	41
NASB	Mark	12	40	Who devour widows&rsquo; houses, and for appearance&rsquo;s sake offer long prayers; these will receive greater condemnation.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	12	41	And He sat down opposite the treasury, and began observing how the people were putting money into the treasury; and many rich people were putting in large sums.	41
NASB	Mark	12	42	A poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which amount to a cent.	41
NASB	Mark	12	43	Calling His disciples to Him, He said to them, &ldquo;Truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all the contributors to the treasury;	41
NASB	Mark	12	44	For they all put in out of their surplus, but she, out of her poverty, put in all she owned, all she had to live on.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	12	5	&ldquo;And he sent another, and that one they killed; and so with many others, beating some and killing others.	41
NASB	Mark	12	6	&ldquo;He had one more to send, a beloved son; he sent him last of all to them, saying, &lsquo;They will respect my son.&rsquo;	41
NASB	Mark	12	7	&ldquo;But those vine-growers said to one another, &lsquo;This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours!&rsquo;	41
NASB	Mark	12	8	&ldquo;They took him, and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard.	41
NASB	Mark	12	9	&ldquo;What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the vine-growers, and will give the vineyard to others.	41
NASB	Mark	13	1	As He was going out of the temple, one of His disciples said to Him, &ldquo;Teacher, behold what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	13	10	&ldquo;The gospel must first be preached to all the nations.	41
NASB	Mark	13	11	&ldquo;When they arrest you and hand you over, do not worry beforehand about what you are to say, but say whatever is given you in that hour; for it is not you who speak, but it is the Holy Spirit.	41
NASB	Mark	13	12	&ldquo;Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.	41
NASB	Mark	13	13	&ldquo;You will be hated by all because of My name, but the one who endures to the end, he will be saved.	41
NASB	Mark	13	14	&ldquo;But when you see the ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION standing where it should not be (let the reader understand), then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains.	41
NASB	Mark	13	15	&ldquo;The one who is on the housetop must not go down, or go in to get anything out of his house;	41
NASB	Mark	13	16	And the one who is in the field must not turn back to get his coat.	41
NASB	Mark	13	17	&ldquo;But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days!	41
NASB	Mark	13	18	&ldquo;But pray that it may not happen in the winter.	41
NASB	Mark	13	19	&ldquo;For those days will be a time of tribulation such as has not occurred since the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will.	41
NASB	Mark	13	2	And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left upon another which will not be torn down.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	13	20	&ldquo;Unless the Lord had shortened those days, no life would have been saved; but for the sake of the elect, whom He chose, He shortened the days.	41
NASB	Mark	13	21	&ldquo;And then if anyone says to you, &lsquo;Behold, here is the Christ&rsquo;; or, &lsquo;Behold, He is there&rsquo;; do not believe him;	41
NASB	Mark	13	22	For false Christs and false prophets will arise, and will show signs and wonders, in order to lead astray, if possible, the elect.	41
NASB	Mark	13	23	&ldquo;But take heed; behold, I have told you everything in advance.	41
NASB	Mark	13	24	&ldquo;But in those days, after that tribulation, THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT,	41
NASB	Mark	13	25	AND THE STARS WILL BE FALLING from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.	41
NASB	Mark	13	26	&ldquo;Then they will see THE SON OF MAN COMING IN CLOUDS with great power and glory.	41
NASB	Mark	13	27	&ldquo;And then He will send forth the angels, and will gather together His elect from the four winds, from the farthest end of the earth to the farthest end of heaven.	41
NASB	Mark	13	28	&ldquo;Now learn the parable from the fig tree: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.	41
NASB	Mark	13	29	&ldquo;Even so, you too, when you see these things happening, recognize that He is near, right at the door.	41
NASB	Mark	13	3	As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew were questioning Him privately,	41
NASB	Mark	13	30	&ldquo;Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.	41
NASB	Mark	13	31	&ldquo;Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.	41
NASB	Mark	13	32	&ldquo;But of that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.	41
NASB	Mark	13	33	&ldquo;Take heed, keep on the alert; for you do not know when the appointed time will come.	41
NASB	Mark	13	34	&ldquo;It is like a man away on a journey, who upon leaving his house and putting his slaves in charge, assigning to each one his task, also commanded the doorkeeper to stay on the alert.	41
NASB	Mark	13	35	&ldquo;Therefore, be on the alert&mdash;for you do not know when the master of the house is coming, whether in the evening, at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning&mdash;	41
NASB	Mark	13	36	In case he should come suddenly and find you asleep.	41
NASB	Mark	13	37	&ldquo;What I say to you I say to all, &lsquo;Be on the alert!&rsquo;&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	13	4	&ldquo;Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are going to be fulfilled?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	13	5	And Jesus began to say to them, &ldquo;See to it that no one misleads you.	41
NASB	Mark	13	6	&ldquo;Many will come in My name, saying, &lsquo;I am He!&rsquo; and will mislead many.	41
NASB	Mark	13	7	&ldquo;When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be frightened; those things must take place; but that is not yet the end.	41
NASB	Mark	13	8	&ldquo;For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will also be famines. These things are merely the beginning of birth pangs.	41
NASB	Mark	13	9	&ldquo;But be on your guard; for they will deliver you to the courts, and you will be flogged in the synagogues, and you will stand before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them.	41
NASB	Mark	14	1	Now the Passover and Unleavened Bread were two days away; and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to seize Him by stealth and kill Him;	41
NASB	Mark	14	10	Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went off to the chief priests in order to betray Him to them.	41
NASB	Mark	14	11	They were glad when they heard this, and promised to give him money. And he began seeking how to betray Him at an opportune time.	41
NASB	Mark	14	12	On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb was being sacrificed, His disciples said to Him, &ldquo;Where do You want us to go and prepare for You to eat the Passover?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	13	And He sent two of His disciples and said to them, &ldquo;Go into the city, and a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him;	41
NASB	Mark	14	14	And wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house, &lsquo;The Teacher says, &ldquo;Where is My guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?&rsquo;&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	15	&ldquo;And he himself will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; prepare for us there.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	16	The disciples went out and came to the city, and found it just as He had told them; and they prepared the Passover.	41
NASB	Mark	14	17	When it was evening He came with the twelve.	41
NASB	Mark	14	18	As they were reclining at the table and eating, Jesus said, &ldquo;Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me&mdash;one who is eating with Me.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	19	They began to be grieved and to say to Him one by one, &ldquo;Surely not I?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	2	For they were saying, &ldquo;Not during the festival, otherwise there might be a riot of the people.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	20	And He said to them, &ldquo;It is one of the twelve, one who dips with Me in the bowl.	41
NASB	Mark	14	21	&ldquo;For the Son of Man is to go just as it is written of Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	22	While they were eating, He took some bread, and after a blessing He broke it, and gave it to them, and said, &ldquo;Take it; this is My body.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	23	And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He gave it to them, and they all drank from it.	41
NASB	Mark	14	24	And He said to them, &ldquo;This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.	41
NASB	Mark	14	25	&ldquo;Truly I say to you, I will never again drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	26	After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.	41
NASB	Mark	14	27	And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;You will all fall away, because it is written, &lsquo;I WILL STRIKE DOWN THE SHEPHERD, AND THE SHEEP SHALL BE SCATTERED.&rsquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	28	&ldquo;But after I have been raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	29	But Peter said to Him, &ldquo;Even though all may fall away, yet I will not.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	3	While He was in Bethany at the home of Simon the leper, and reclining at the table, there came a woman with an alabaster vial of very costly perfume of pure nard; and she broke the vial and poured it over His head.	41
NASB	Mark	14	30	And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Truly I say to you, that this very night, before a rooster crows twice, you yourself will deny Me three times.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	31	But Peter kept saying insistently, &ldquo;Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You!&rdquo; And they all were saying the same thing also.	41
NASB	Mark	14	32	They came to a place named Gethsemane; and He said to His disciples, &ldquo;Sit here until I have prayed.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	33	And He took with Him Peter and James and John, and began to be very distressed and troubled.	41
NASB	Mark	14	34	And He said to them, &ldquo;My soul is deeply grieved to the point of death; remain here and keep watch.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	35	And He went a little beyond them, and fell to the ground and began to pray that if it were possible, the hour might pass Him by.	41
NASB	Mark	14	36	And He was saying, &ldquo;Abba! Father! All things are possible for You; remove this cup from Me; yet not what I will, but what You will.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	37	And He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, &ldquo;Simon, are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?	41
NASB	Mark	14	38	&ldquo;Keep watching and praying that you may not come into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	39	Again He went away and prayed, saying the same words.	41
NASB	Mark	14	4	But some were indignantly remarking to one another, &ldquo;Why has this perfume been wasted?	41
NASB	Mark	14	40	And again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what to answer Him.	41
NASB	Mark	14	41	And He came the third time, and said to them, &ldquo;Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough; the hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.	41
NASB	Mark	14	42	&ldquo;Get up, let us be going; behold, the one who betrays Me is at hand!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	43	Immediately while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came up accompanied by a crowd with swords and clubs, who were from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.	41
NASB	Mark	14	44	Now he who was betraying Him had given them a signal, saying, &ldquo;Whomever I kiss, He is the one; seize Him and lead Him away under guard.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	45	After coming, Judas immediately went to Him, saying, &ldquo;Rabbi!&rdquo; and kissed Him.	41
NASB	Mark	14	46	They laid hands on Him and seized Him.	41
NASB	Mark	14	47	But one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear.	41
NASB	Mark	14	48	And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me, as you would against a robber?	41
NASB	Mark	14	49	&ldquo;Every day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize Me; but this has taken place to fulfill the Scriptures.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	5	&ldquo;For this perfume might have been sold for over three hundred denarii, and the money given to the poor.&rdquo; And they were scolding her.	41
NASB	Mark	14	50	And they all left Him and fled.	41
NASB	Mark	14	51	A young man was following Him, wearing nothing but a linen sheet over his naked body; and they seized him.	41
NASB	Mark	14	52	But he pulled free of the linen sheet and escaped naked.	41
NASB	Mark	14	53	They led Jesus away to the high priest; and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes gathered together.	41
NASB	Mark	14	54	Peter had followed Him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the officers and warming himself at the fire.	41
NASB	Mark	14	55	Now the chief priests and the whole Council kept trying to obtain testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, and they were not finding any.	41
NASB	Mark	14	56	For many were giving false testimony against Him, but their testimony was not consistent.	41
NASB	Mark	14	57	Some stood up and began to give false testimony against Him, saying,	41
NASB	Mark	14	58	&ldquo;We heard Him say, &lsquo;I will destroy this temple made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.&rsquo;&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	59	Not even in this respect was their testimony consistent.	41
NASB	Mark	14	6	But Jesus said, &ldquo;Let her alone; why do you bother her? She has done a good deed to Me.	41
NASB	Mark	14	60	The high priest stood up and came forward and questioned Jesus, saying, &ldquo;Do You not answer? What is it that these men are testifying against You?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	61	But He kept silent and did not answer. Again the high priest was questioning Him, and saying to Him, &ldquo;Are You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	62	And Jesus said, &ldquo;I am; and you shall see THE SON OF MAN SITTING AT THE RIGHT HAND OF POWER, and COMING WITH THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	63	Tearing his clothes, the high priest said, &ldquo;What further need do we have of witnesses?	41
NASB	Mark	14	64	&ldquo;You have heard the blasphemy; how does it seem to you?&rdquo; And they all condemned Him to be deserving of death.	41
NASB	Mark	14	65	Some began to spit at Him, and to blindfold Him, and to beat Him with their fists, and to say to Him, &ldquo;Prophesy!&rdquo; And the officers received Him with slaps in the face.	41
NASB	Mark	14	66	As Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant-girls of the high priest came,	41
NASB	Mark	14	67	And seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, &ldquo;You also were with Jesus the Nazarene.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	68	But he denied it, saying, &ldquo;I neither know nor understand what you are talking about.&rdquo; And he went out onto the porch.	41
NASB	Mark	14	69	The servant-girl saw him, and began once more to say to the bystanders, &ldquo;This is one of them!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	7	&ldquo;For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you wish you can do good to them; but you do not always have Me.	41
NASB	Mark	14	70	But again he denied it. And after a little while the bystanders were again saying to Peter, &ldquo;Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean too.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	71	But he began to curse and swear, &ldquo;I do not know this man you are talking about!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	14	72	Immediately a rooster crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had made the remark to him, &ldquo;Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.&rdquo; And he began to weep.	41
NASB	Mark	14	8	&ldquo;She has done what she could; she has anointed My body beforehand for the burial.	41
NASB	Mark	14	9	&ldquo;Truly I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of in memory of her.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	15	1	Early in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes and the whole Council, immediately held a consultation; and binding Jesus, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate.	41
NASB	Mark	15	10	For he was aware that the chief priests had handed Him over because of envy.	41
NASB	Mark	15	11	But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to ask him to release Barabbas for them instead.	41
NASB	Mark	15	12	Answering again, Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Then what shall I do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	15	13	They shouted back, &ldquo;Crucify Him!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	15	14	But Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Why, what evil has He done?&rdquo; But they shouted all the more, &ldquo;Crucify Him!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	15	15	Wishing to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas for them, and after having Jesus scourged, he handed Him over to be crucified.	41
NASB	Mark	15	16	The soldiers took Him away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium), and they called together the whole Roman cohort.	41
NASB	Mark	15	17	They dressed Him up in purple, and after twisting a crown of thorns, they put it on Him;	41
NASB	Mark	15	18	And they began to acclaim Him, &ldquo;Hail, King of the Jews!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	15	19	They kept beating His head with a reed, and spitting on Him, and kneeling and bowing before Him.	41
NASB	Mark	15	2	Pilate questioned Him, &ldquo;Are You the King of the Jews?&rdquo; And He answered him, &ldquo;It is as you say.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	15	20	After they had mocked Him, they took the purple robe off Him and put His own garments on Him. And they led Him out to crucify Him.	41
NASB	Mark	15	21	They pressed into service a passer-by coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene (the father of Alexander and Rufus), to bear His cross.	41
NASB	Mark	15	22	Then they brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull.	41
NASB	Mark	15	23	They tried to give Him wine mixed with myrrh; but He did not take it.	41
NASB	Mark	15	24	And they crucified Him, and divided up His garments among themselves, casting lots for them to decide what each man should take.	41
NASB	Mark	15	25	It was the third hour when they crucified Him.	41
NASB	Mark	15	26	The inscription of the charge against Him read, &ldquo;THE KING OF THE JEWS.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	15	27	They crucified two robbers with Him, one on His right and one on His left.	41
NASB	Mark	15	28	[And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, &ldquo;And He was numbered with transgressors.&rdquo;]	41
NASB	Mark	15	29	Those passing by were hurling abuse at Him, wagging their heads, and saying, &ldquo;Ha! You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,	41
NASB	Mark	15	3	The chief priests began to accuse Him harshly.	41
NASB	Mark	15	30	Save Yourself, and come down from the cross!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	15	31	In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes, were mocking Him among themselves and saying, &ldquo;He saved others; He cannot save Himself.	41
NASB	Mark	15	32	&ldquo;Let this Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, so that we may see and believe!&rdquo; Those who were crucified with Him were also insulting Him.	41
NASB	Mark	15	33	When the sixth hour came, darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour.	41
NASB	Mark	15	34	At the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, &ldquo;ELOI, ELOI, LAMA SABACHTHANI?&rdquo; which is translated, &ldquo;MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	15	35	When some of the bystanders heard it, they began saying, &ldquo;Behold, He is calling for Elijah.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	15	36	Someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink, saying, &ldquo;Let us see whether Elijah will come to take Him down.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	15	37	And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed His last.	41
NASB	Mark	15	38	And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.	41
NASB	Mark	15	39	When the centurion, who was standing right in front of Him, saw the way He breathed His last, he said, &ldquo;Truly this man was the Son of God!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	15	4	Then Pilate questioned Him again, saying, &ldquo;Do You not answer? See how many charges they bring against You!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	15	40	There were also some women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the Less and Joses, and Salome.	41
NASB	Mark	15	41	When He was in Galilee, they used to follow Him and minister to Him; and there were many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem.	41
NASB	Mark	15	42	When evening had already come, because it was the preparation day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,	41
NASB	Mark	15	43	Joseph of Arimathea came, a prominent member of the Council, who himself was waiting for the kingdom of God; and he gathered up courage and went in before Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.	41
NASB	Mark	15	44	Pilate wondered if He was dead by this time, and summoning the centurion, he questioned him as to whether He was already dead.	41
NASB	Mark	15	45	And ascertaining this from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.	41
NASB	Mark	15	46	Joseph bought a linen cloth, took Him down, wrapped Him in the linen cloth and laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.	41
NASB	Mark	15	47	Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were looking on to see where He was laid.	41
NASB	Mark	15	5	But Jesus made no further answer; so Pilate was amazed.	41
NASB	Mark	15	6	Now at the feast he used to release for them any one prisoner whom they requested.	41
NASB	Mark	15	7	The man named Barabbas had been imprisoned with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the insurrection.	41
NASB	Mark	15	8	The crowd went up and began asking him to do as he had been accustomed to do for them.	41
NASB	Mark	15	9	Pilate answered them, saying, &ldquo;Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	16	1	When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, so that they might come and anoint Him.	41
NASB	Mark	16	10	She went and reported to those who had been with Him, while they were mourning and weeping.	41
NASB	Mark	16	11	When they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they refused to believe it.	41
NASB	Mark	16	12	After that, He appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking along on their way to the country.	41
NASB	Mark	16	13	They went away and reported it to the others, but they did not believe them either.	41
NASB	Mark	16	14	Afterward He appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining at the table; and He reproached them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen Him after He had risen.	41
NASB	Mark	16	15	And He said to them, &ldquo;Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.	41
NASB	Mark	16	16	&ldquo;He who has believed and has been baptized shall be saved; but he who has disbelieved shall be condemned.	41
NASB	Mark	16	17	&ldquo;These signs will accompany those who have believed: in My name they will cast out demons, they will speak with new tongues;	41
NASB	Mark	16	18	They will pick up serpents, and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	16	19	So then, when the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.	41
NASB	Mark	16	2	Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen.	41
NASB	Mark	16	20	And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them, and confirmed the word by the signs that followed.] [And they promptly reported all these instructions to Peter and his companions. And after that, Jesus Himself sent out through them from east to west the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation.]	41
NASB	Mark	16	3	They were saying to one another, &ldquo;Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	16	4	Looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away, although it was extremely large.	41
NASB	Mark	16	5	Entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting at the right, wearing a white robe; and they were amazed.	41
NASB	Mark	16	6	And he said to them, &ldquo;Do not be amazed; you are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen; He is not here; behold, here is the place where they laid Him.	41
NASB	Mark	16	7	&ldquo;But go, tell His disciples and Peter, &lsquo;He is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see Him, just as He told you.&rsquo;&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	16	8	They went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had gripped them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.	41
NASB	Mark	16	9	[Now after He had risen early on the first day of the week, He first appeared to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven demons.	41
NASB	Mark	2	1	When He had come back to Capernaum several days afterward, it was heard that He was at home.	41
NASB	Mark	2	10	&ldquo;But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins&rdquo;&mdash;He said to the paralytic,	41
NASB	Mark	2	11	&ldquo;I say to you, get up, pick up your pallet and go home.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	2	12	And he got up and immediately picked up the pallet and went out in the sight of everyone, so that they were all amazed and were glorifying God, saying, &ldquo;We have never seen anything like this.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	2	13	And He went out again by the seashore; and all the people were coming to Him, and He was teaching them.	41
NASB	Mark	2	14	As He passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting in the tax booth, and He said to him, &ldquo;Follow Me!&rdquo; And he got up and followed Him.	41
NASB	Mark	2	15	And it happened that He was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners were dining with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many of them, and they were following Him.	41
NASB	Mark	2	16	When the scribes of the Pharisees saw that He was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they said to His disciples, &ldquo;Why is He eating and drinking with tax collectors and sinners?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	2	17	And hearing this, Jesus said to them, &ldquo;It is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick; I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	2	18	John&rsquo;s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting; and they came and said to Him, &ldquo;Why do John&rsquo;s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	2	19	And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;While the bridegroom is with them, the attendants of the bridegroom cannot fast, can they? So long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.	41
NASB	Mark	2	2	And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room, not even near the door; and He was speaking the word to them.	41
NASB	Mark	2	20	&ldquo;But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.	41
NASB	Mark	2	21	&ldquo;No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; otherwise the patch pulls away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear results.	41
NASB	Mark	2	22	&ldquo;No one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost and the skins as well; but one puts new wine into fresh wineskins.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	2	23	And it happened that He was passing through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples began to make their way along while picking the heads of grain.	41
NASB	Mark	2	24	The Pharisees were saying to Him, &ldquo;Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	2	25	And He said to them, &ldquo;Have you never read what David did when he was in need and he and his companions became hungry;	41
NASB	Mark	2	26	How he entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the consecrated bread, which is not lawful for anyone to eat except the priests, and he also gave it to those who were with him?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	2	27	Jesus said to them, &ldquo;The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.	41
NASB	Mark	2	28	&ldquo;So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	2	3	And they came, bringing to Him a paralytic, carried by four men.	41
NASB	Mark	2	4	Being unable to get to Him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above Him; and when they had dug an opening, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was lying.	41
NASB	Mark	2	5	And Jesus seeing their faith said to the paralytic, &ldquo;Son, your sins are forgiven.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	2	6	But some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,	41
NASB	Mark	2	7	&ldquo;Why does this man speak that way? He is blaspheming; who can forgive sins but God alone?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	2	8	Immediately Jesus, aware in His spirit that they were reasoning that way within themselves, said to them, &ldquo;Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts?	41
NASB	Mark	2	9	&ldquo;Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, &lsquo;Your sins are forgiven&rsquo;; or to say, &lsquo;Get up, and pick up your pallet and walk&rsquo;?	41
NASB	Mark	3	1	He entered again into a synagogue; and a man was there whose hand was withered.	41
NASB	Mark	3	10	For He had healed many, with the result that all those who had afflictions pressed around Him in order to touch Him.	41
NASB	Mark	3	11	Whenever the unclean spirits saw Him, they would fall down before Him and shout, &ldquo;You are the Son of God!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	3	12	And He earnestly warned them not to tell who He was.	41
NASB	Mark	3	13	And He went up on the mountain and summoned those whom He Himself wanted, and they came to Him.	41
NASB	Mark	3	14	And He appointed twelve, so that they would be with Him and that He could send them out to preach,	41
NASB	Mark	3	15	And to have authority to cast out the demons.	41
NASB	Mark	3	16	And He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom He gave the name Peter),	41
NASB	Mark	3	17	And James, the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James (to them He gave the name Boanerges, which means, &ldquo;Sons of Thunder&rdquo;);	41
NASB	Mark	3	18	And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot;	41
NASB	Mark	3	19	And Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Him.	41
NASB	Mark	3	2	They were watching Him to see if He would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse Him.	41
NASB	Mark	3	20	And He came home, and the crowd gathered again, to such an extent that they could not even eat a meal.	41
NASB	Mark	3	21	When His own people heard of this, they went out to take custody of Him; for they were saying, &ldquo;He has lost His senses.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	3	22	The scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, &ldquo;He is possessed by Beelzebul,&rdquo; and &ldquo;He casts out the demons by the ruler of the demons.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	3	23	And He called them to Himself and began speaking to them in parables, &ldquo;How can Satan cast out Satan?	41
NASB	Mark	3	24	&ldquo;If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.	41
NASB	Mark	3	25	&ldquo;If a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.	41
NASB	Mark	3	26	&ldquo;If Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but he is finished!	41
NASB	Mark	3	27	&ldquo;But no one can enter the strong man&rsquo;s house and plunder his property unless he first binds the strong man, and then he will plunder his house.	41
NASB	Mark	3	28	&ldquo;Truly I say to you, all sins shall be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter;	41
NASB	Mark	3	29	But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin&rdquo;&mdash;	41
NASB	Mark	3	3	He said to the man with the withered hand, &ldquo;Get up and come forward!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	3	30	Because they were saying, &ldquo;He has an unclean spirit.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	3	31	Then His mother and His brothers arrived, and standing outside they sent word to Him and called Him.	41
NASB	Mark	3	32	A crowd was sitting around Him, and they said to Him, &ldquo;Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are outside looking for You.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	3	33	Answering them, He said, &ldquo;Who are My mother and My brothers?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	3	34	Looking about at those who were sitting around Him, He said, &ldquo;Behold My mother and My brothers!	41
NASB	Mark	3	35	&ldquo;For whoever does the will of God, he is My brother and sister and mother.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	3	4	And He said to them, &ldquo;Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath, to save a life or to kill?&rdquo; But they kept silent.	41
NASB	Mark	3	5	After looking around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, He said to the man, &ldquo;Stretch out your hand.&rdquo; And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored.	41
NASB	Mark	3	6	The Pharisees went out and immediately began conspiring with the Herodians against Him, as to how they might destroy Him.	41
NASB	Mark	3	7	Jesus withdrew to the sea with His disciples; and a great multitude from Galilee followed; and also from Judea,	41
NASB	Mark	3	8	And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and beyond the Jordan, and the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon, a great number of people heard of all that He was doing and came to Him.	41
NASB	Mark	3	9	And He told His disciples that a boat should stand ready for Him because of the crowd, so that they would not crowd Him;	41
NASB	Mark	4	1	He began to teach again by the sea. And such a very large crowd gathered to Him that He got into a boat in the sea and sat down; and the whole crowd was by the sea on the land.	41
NASB	Mark	4	10	As soon as He was alone, His followers, along with the twelve, began asking Him about the parables.	41
NASB	Mark	4	11	And He was saying to them, &ldquo;To you has been given the mystery of the kingdom of God, but those who are outside get everything in parables,	41
NASB	Mark	4	12	So that WHILE SEEING, THEY MAY SEE AND NOT PERCEIVE, AND WHILE HEARING, THEY MAY HEAR AND NOT UNDERSTAND, OTHERWISE THEY MIGHT RETURN AND BE FORGIVEN.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	4	13	And He said to them, &ldquo;Do you not understand this parable? How will you understand all the parables?	41
NASB	Mark	4	14	&ldquo;The sower sows the word.	41
NASB	Mark	4	15	&ldquo;These are the ones who are beside the road where the word is sown; and when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown in them.	41
NASB	Mark	4	16	&ldquo;In a similar way these are the ones on whom seed was sown on the rocky places, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy;	41
NASB	Mark	4	17	And they have no firm root in themselves, but are only temporary; then, when affliction or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they fall away.	41
NASB	Mark	4	18	&ldquo;And others are the ones on whom seed was sown among the thorns; these are the ones who have heard the word,	41
NASB	Mark	4	19	But the worries of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.	41
NASB	Mark	4	2	And He was teaching them many things in parables, and was saying to them in His teaching,	41
NASB	Mark	4	20	&ldquo;And those are the ones on whom seed was sown on the good soil; and they hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	4	21	And He was saying to them, &ldquo;A lamp is not brought to be put under a basket, is it, or under a bed? Is it not brought to be put on the lampstand?	41
NASB	Mark	4	22	&ldquo;For nothing is hidden, except to be revealed; nor has anything been secret, but that it would come to light.	41
NASB	Mark	4	23	&ldquo;If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	4	24	And He was saying to them, &ldquo;Take care what you listen to. By your standard of measure it will be measured to you; and more will be given you besides.	41
NASB	Mark	4	25	&ldquo;For whoever has, to him more shall be given; and whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	4	26	And He was saying, &ldquo;The kingdom of God is like a man who casts seed upon the soil;	41
NASB	Mark	4	27	And he goes to bed at night and gets up by day, and the seed sprouts and grows&mdash;how, he himself does not know.	41
NASB	Mark	4	28	&ldquo;The soil produces crops by itself; first the blade, then the head, then the mature grain in the head.	41
NASB	Mark	4	29	&ldquo;But when the crop permits, he immediately puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	4	3	&ldquo;Listen to this! Behold, the sower went out to sow;	41
NASB	Mark	4	30	And He said, &ldquo;How shall we picture the kingdom of God, or by what parable shall we present it?	41
NASB	Mark	4	31	&ldquo;It is like a mustard seed, which, when sown upon the soil, though it is smaller than all the seeds that are upon the soil,	41
NASB	Mark	4	32	Yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and forms large branches; so that THE BIRDS OF THE AIR can NEST UNDER ITS SHADE.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	4	33	With many such parables He was speaking the word to them, so far as they were able to hear it;	41
NASB	Mark	4	34	And He did not speak to them without a parable; but He was explaining everything privately to His own disciples.	41
NASB	Mark	4	35	On that day, when evening came, He said to them, &ldquo;Let us go over to the other side.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	4	36	Leaving the crowd, they took Him along with them in the boat, just as He was; and other boats were with Him.	41
NASB	Mark	4	37	And there arose a fierce gale of wind, and the waves were breaking over the boat so much that the boat was already filling up.	41
NASB	Mark	4	38	Jesus Himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke Him and said to Him, &ldquo;Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	4	39	And He got up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, &ldquo;Hush, be still.&rdquo; And the wind died down and it became perfectly calm.	41
NASB	Mark	4	4	As he was sowing, some seed fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate it up.	41
NASB	Mark	4	40	And He said to them, &ldquo;Why are you afraid? Do you still have no faith?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	4	41	They became very much afraid and said to one another, &ldquo;Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	4	5	&ldquo;Other seed fell on the rocky ground where it did not have much soil; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of soil.	41
NASB	Mark	4	6	&ldquo;And after the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.	41
NASB	Mark	4	7	&ldquo;Other seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked it, and it yielded no crop.	41
NASB	Mark	4	8	&ldquo;Other seeds fell into the good soil, and as they grew up and increased, they yielded a crop and produced thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	4	9	And He was saying, &ldquo;He who has ears to hear, let him hear.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	5	1	They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes.	41
NASB	Mark	5	10	And he began to implore Him earnestly not to send them out of the country.	41
NASB	Mark	5	11	Now there was a large herd of swine feeding nearby on the mountain.	41
NASB	Mark	5	12	The demons implored Him, saying, &ldquo;Send us into the swine so that we may enter them.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	5	13	Jesus gave them permission. And coming out, the unclean spirits entered the swine; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, about two thousand of them; and they were drowned in the sea.	41
NASB	Mark	5	14	Their herdsmen ran away and reported it in the city and in the country. And the people came to see what it was that had happened.	41
NASB	Mark	5	15	They came to Jesus and observed the man who had been demon-possessed sitting down, clothed and in his right mind, the very man who had had the &ldquo;legion&rdquo;; and they became frightened.	41
NASB	Mark	5	16	Those who had seen it described to them how it had happened to the demon-possessed man, and all about the swine.	41
NASB	Mark	5	17	And they began to implore Him to leave their region.	41
NASB	Mark	5	18	As He was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed was imploring Him that he might accompany Him.	41
NASB	Mark	5	19	And He did not let him, but He said to him, &ldquo;Go home to your people and report to them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He had mercy on you.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	5	2	When He got out of the boat, immediately a man from the tombs with an unclean spirit met Him,	41
NASB	Mark	5	20	And he went away and began to proclaim in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed.	41
NASB	Mark	5	21	When Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around Him; and so He stayed by the seashore.	41
NASB	Mark	5	22	One of the synagogue officials named Jairus came up, and on seeing Him, fell at His feet	41
NASB	Mark	5	23	And implored Him earnestly, saying, &ldquo;My little daughter is at the point of death; please come and lay Your hands on her, so that she will get well and live.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	5	24	And He went off with him; and a large crowd was following Him and pressing in on Him.	41
NASB	Mark	5	25	A woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years,	41
NASB	Mark	5	26	And had endured much at the hands of many physicians, and had spent all that she had and was not helped at all, but rather had grown worse&mdash;	41
NASB	Mark	5	27	After hearing about Jesus, she came up in the crowd behind Him and touched His cloak.	41
NASB	Mark	5	28	For she thought, &ldquo;If I just touch His garments, I will get well.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	5	29	Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.	41
NASB	Mark	5	3	And he had his dwelling among the tombs. And no one was able to bind him anymore, even with a chain;	41
NASB	Mark	5	30	Immediately Jesus, perceiving in Himself that the power proceeding from Him had gone forth, turned around in the crowd and said, &ldquo;Who touched My garments?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	5	31	And His disciples said to Him, &ldquo;You see the crowd pressing in on You, and You say, &lsquo;Who touched Me?&rsquo;&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	5	32	And He looked around to see the woman who had done this.	41
NASB	Mark	5	33	But the woman fearing and trembling, aware of what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth.	41
NASB	Mark	5	34	And He said to her, &ldquo;Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace and be healed of your affliction.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	5	35	While He was still speaking, they came from the house of the synagogue official, saying, &ldquo;Your daughter has died; why trouble the Teacher anymore?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	5	36	But Jesus, overhearing what was being spoken, said to the synagogue official, &ldquo;Do not be afraid any longer, only believe.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	5	37	And He allowed no one to accompany Him, except Peter and James and John the brother of James.	41
NASB	Mark	5	38	They came to the house of the synagogue official; and He saw a commotion, and people loudly weeping and wailing.	41
NASB	Mark	5	39	And entering in, He said to them, &ldquo;Why make a commotion and weep? The child has not died, but is asleep.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	5	4	Because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him and the shackles broken in pieces, and no one was strong enough to subdue him.	41
NASB	Mark	5	40	They began laughing at Him. But putting them all out, He took along the child&rsquo;s father and mother and His own companions, and entered the room where the child was.	41
NASB	Mark	5	41	Taking the child by the hand, He said to her, &ldquo;Talitha kum!&rdquo; (which translated means, &ldquo;Little girl, I say to you, get up!&rdquo;).	41
NASB	Mark	5	42	Immediately the girl got up and began to walk, for she was twelve years old. And immediately they were completely astounded.	41
NASB	Mark	5	43	And He gave them strict orders that no one should know about this, and He said that something should be given her to eat.	41
NASB	Mark	5	5	Constantly, night and day, he was screaming among the tombs and in the mountains, and gashing himself with stones.	41
NASB	Mark	5	6	Seeing Jesus from a distance, he ran up and bowed down before Him;	41
NASB	Mark	5	7	And shouting with a loud voice, he said, &ldquo;What business do we have with each other, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore You by God, do not torment me!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	5	8	For He had been saying to him, &ldquo;Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	5	9	And He was asking him, &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; And he said to Him, &ldquo;My name is Legion; for we are many.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	6	1	Jesus went out from there and came into His hometown; and His disciples followed Him.	41
NASB	Mark	6	10	And He said to them, &ldquo;Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave town.	41
NASB	Mark	6	11	&ldquo;Any place that does not receive you or listen to you, as you go out from there, shake the dust off the soles of your feet for a testimony against them.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	6	12	They went out and preached that men should repent.	41
NASB	Mark	6	13	And they were casting out many demons and were anointing with oil many sick people and healing them.	41
NASB	Mark	6	14	And King Herod heard of it, for His name had become well known; and people were saying, &ldquo;John the Baptist has risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are at work in Him.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	6	15	But others were saying, &ldquo;He is Elijah.&rdquo; And others were saying, &ldquo;He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	6	16	But when Herod heard of it, he kept saying, &ldquo;John, whom I beheaded, has risen!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	6	17	For Herod himself had sent and had John arrested and bound in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, because he had married her.	41
NASB	Mark	6	18	For John had been saying to Herod, &ldquo;It is not lawful for you to have your brother&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	6	19	Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death and could not do so;	41
NASB	Mark	6	2	When the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue; and the many listeners were astonished, saying, &ldquo;Where did this man get these things, and what is this wisdom given to Him, and such miracles as these performed by His hands?	41
NASB	Mark	6	20	For Herod was afraid of John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. And when he heard him, he was very perplexed; but he used to enjoy listening to him.	41
NASB	Mark	6	21	A strategic day came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his lords and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee;	41
NASB	Mark	6	22	And when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests; and the king said to the girl, &ldquo;Ask me for whatever you want and I will give it to you.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	6	23	And he swore to her, &ldquo;Whatever you ask of me, I will give it to you; up to half of my kingdom.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	6	24	And she went out and said to her mother, &ldquo;What shall I ask for?&rdquo; And she said, &ldquo;The head of John the Baptist.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	6	25	Immediately she came in a hurry to the king and asked, saying, &ldquo;I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	6	26	And although the king was very sorry, yet because of his oaths and because of his dinner guests, he was unwilling to refuse her.	41
NASB	Mark	6	27	Immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded him to bring back his head. And he went and had him beheaded in the prison,	41
NASB	Mark	6	28	And brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother.	41
NASB	Mark	6	29	When his disciples heard about this, they came and took away his body and laid it in a tomb.	41
NASB	Mark	6	3	&ldquo;Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? Are not His sisters here with us?&rdquo; And they took offense at Him.	41
NASB	Mark	6	30	The apostles gathered together with Jesus; and they reported to Him all that they had done and taught.	41
NASB	Mark	6	31	And He said to them, &ldquo;Come away by yourselves to a secluded place and rest a while.&rdquo; (For there were many people coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat.)	41
NASB	Mark	6	32	They went away in the boat to a secluded place by themselves.	41
NASB	Mark	6	33	The people saw them going, and many recognized them and ran there together on foot from all the cities, and got there ahead of them.	41
NASB	Mark	6	34	When Jesus went ashore, He saw a large crowd, and He felt compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and He began to teach them many things.	41
NASB	Mark	6	35	When it was already quite late, His disciples came to Him and said, &ldquo;This place is desolate and it is already quite late;	41
NASB	Mark	6	36	Send them away so that they may go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	6	37	But He answered them, &ldquo;You give them something to eat!&rdquo; And they said to Him, &ldquo;Shall we go and spend two hundred denarii on bread and give them something to eat?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	6	38	And He said to them, &ldquo;How many loaves do you have? Go look!&rdquo; And when they found out, they said, &ldquo;Five, and two fish.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	6	39	And He commanded them all to sit down by groups on the green grass.	41
NASB	Mark	6	4	Jesus said to them, &ldquo;A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and among his own relatives and in his own household.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	6	40	They sat down in groups of hundreds and of fifties.	41
NASB	Mark	6	41	And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up toward heaven, He blessed the food and broke the loaves and He kept giving them to the disciples to set before them; and He divided up the two fish among them all.	41
NASB	Mark	6	42	They all ate and were satisfied,	41
NASB	Mark	6	43	And they picked up twelve full baskets of the broken pieces, and also of the fish.	41
NASB	Mark	6	44	There were five thousand men who ate the loaves.	41
NASB	Mark	6	45	Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side to Bethsaida, while He Himself was sending the crowd away.	41
NASB	Mark	6	46	After bidding them farewell, He left for the mountain to pray.	41
NASB	Mark	6	47	When it was evening, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and He was alone on the land.	41
NASB	Mark	6	48	Seeing them straining at the oars, for the wind was against them, at about the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea; and He intended to pass by them.	41
NASB	Mark	6	49	But when they saw Him walking on the sea, they supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;	41
NASB	Mark	6	5	And He could do no miracle there except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them.	41
NASB	Mark	6	50	For they all saw Him and were terrified. But immediately He spoke with them and said to them, &ldquo;Take courage; it is I, do not be afraid.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	6	51	Then He got into the boat with them, and the wind stopped; and they were utterly astonished,	41
NASB	Mark	6	52	For they had not gained any insight from the incident of the loaves, but their heart was hardened.	41
NASB	Mark	6	53	When they had crossed over they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.	41
NASB	Mark	6	54	When they got out of the boat, immediately the people recognized Him,	41
NASB	Mark	6	55	And ran about that whole country and began to carry here and there on their pallets those who were sick, to the place they heard He was.	41
NASB	Mark	6	56	Wherever He entered villages, or cities, or countryside, they were laying the sick in the market places, and imploring Him that they might just touch the fringe of His cloak; and as many as touched it were being cured.	41
NASB	Mark	6	6	And He wondered at their unbelief. And He was going around the villages teaching.	41
NASB	Mark	6	7	And He summoned the twelve and began to send them out in pairs, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits;	41
NASB	Mark	6	8	And He instructed them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a mere staff&mdash;no bread, no bag, no money in their belt&mdash;	41
NASB	Mark	6	9	But to wear sandals; and He added, &ldquo;Do not put on two tunics.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	7	1	The Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered around Him when they had come from Jerusalem,	41
NASB	Mark	7	10	&ldquo;For Moses said, &lsquo;HONOR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER&rsquo;; and, &lsquo;HE WHO SPEAKS EVIL OF FATHER OR MOTHER, IS TO BE PUT TO DEATH&rsquo;;	41
NASB	Mark	7	11	But you say, &lsquo;If a man says to his father or his mother, whatever I have that would help you is Corban (that is to say, given to God),&rsquo;	41
NASB	Mark	7	12	You no longer permit him to do anything for his father or his mother;	41
NASB	Mark	7	13	Thus invalidating the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down; and you do many things such as that.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	7	14	After He called the crowd to Him again, He began saying to them, &ldquo;Listen to Me, all of you, and understand:	41
NASB	Mark	7	15	There is nothing outside the man which can defile him if it goes into him; but the things which proceed out of the man are what defile the man.	41
NASB	Mark	7	16	[&ldquo;If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.&rdquo;]	41
NASB	Mark	7	17	When he had left the crowd and entered the house, His disciples questioned Him about the parable.	41
NASB	Mark	7	18	And He said to them, &ldquo;Are you so lacking in understanding also? Do you not understand that whatever goes into the man from outside cannot defile him,	41
NASB	Mark	7	19	Because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, and is eliminated?&rdquo; (Thus He declared all foods clean.)	41
NASB	Mark	7	2	And had seen that some of His disciples were eating their bread with impure hands, that is, unwashed.	41
NASB	Mark	7	20	And He was saying, &ldquo;That which proceeds out of the man, that is what defiles the man.	41
NASB	Mark	7	21	&ldquo;For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed the evil thoughts, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,	41
NASB	Mark	7	22	Deeds of coveting and wickedness, as well as deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride and foolishness.	41
NASB	Mark	7	23	&ldquo;All these evil things proceed from within and defile the man.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	7	24	Jesus got up and went away from there to the region of Tyre. And when He had entered a house, He wanted no one to know of it; yet He could not escape notice.	41
NASB	Mark	7	25	But after hearing of Him, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately came and fell at His feet.	41
NASB	Mark	7	26	Now the woman was a Gentile, of the Syrophoenician race. And she kept asking Him to cast the demon out of her daughter.	41
NASB	Mark	7	27	And He was saying to her, &ldquo;Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not good to take the children&rsquo;s bread and throw it to the dogs.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	7	28	But she answered and said to Him, &ldquo;Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table feed on the children&rsquo;s crumbs.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	7	29	And He said to her, &ldquo;Because of this answer go; the demon has gone out of your daughter.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	7	3	(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they carefully wash their hands, thus observing the traditions of the elders;	41
NASB	Mark	7	30	And going back to her home, she found the child lying on the bed, the demon having left.	41
NASB	Mark	7	31	Again He went out from the region of Tyre, and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, within the region of Decapolis.	41
NASB	Mark	7	32	They brought to Him one who was deaf and spoke with difficulty, and they implored Him to lay His hand on him.	41
NASB	Mark	7	33	Jesus took him aside from the crowd, by himself, and put His fingers into his ears, and after spitting, He touched his tongue with the saliva;	41
NASB	Mark	7	34	And looking up to heaven with a deep sigh, He said to him, &ldquo;Ephphatha!&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;Be opened!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	7	35	And his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was removed, and he began speaking plainly.	41
NASB	Mark	7	36	And He gave them orders not to tell anyone; but the more He ordered them, the more widely they continued to proclaim it.	41
NASB	Mark	7	37	They were utterly astonished, saying, &ldquo;He has done all things well; He makes even the deaf to hear and the mute to speak.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	7	4	And when they come from the market place, they do not eat unless they cleanse themselves; and there are many other things which they have received in order to observe, such as the washing of cups and pitchers and copper pots.)	41
NASB	Mark	7	5	The Pharisees and the scribes asked Him, &ldquo;Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with impure hands?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	7	6	And He said to them, &ldquo;Rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: &lsquo;THIS PEOPLE HONORS ME WITH THEIR LIPS, BUT THEIR HEART IS FAR AWAY FROM ME.	41
NASB	Mark	7	7	&lsquo;BUT IN VAIN DO THEY WORSHIP ME, TEACHING AS DOCTRINES THE PRECEPTS OF MEN.&rsquo;	41
NASB	Mark	7	8	&ldquo;Neglecting the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	7	9	He was also saying to them, &ldquo;You are experts at setting aside the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition.	41
NASB	Mark	8	1	In those days, when there was again a large crowd and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples and said to them,	41
NASB	Mark	8	10	And immediately He entered the boat with His disciples and came to the district of Dalmanutha.	41
NASB	Mark	8	11	The Pharisees came out and began to argue with Him, seeking from Him a sign from heaven, to test Him.	41
NASB	Mark	8	12	Sighing deeply in His spirit, He said, &ldquo;Why does this generation seek for a sign? Truly I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	8	13	Leaving them, He again embarked and went away to the other side.	41
NASB	Mark	8	14	And they had forgotten to take bread, and did not have more than one loaf in the boat with them.	41
NASB	Mark	8	15	And He was giving orders to them, saying, &ldquo;Watch out! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	8	16	They began to discuss with one another the fact that they had no bread.	41
NASB	Mark	8	17	And Jesus, aware of this, said to them, &ldquo;Why do you discuss the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet see or understand? Do you have a hardened heart?	41
NASB	Mark	8	18	&ldquo;HAVING EYES, DO YOU NOT SEE? AND HAVING EARS, DO YOU NOT HEAR? And do you not remember,	41
NASB	Mark	8	19	When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces you picked up?&rdquo; They said to Him, &ldquo;Twelve.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	8	2	&ldquo;I feel compassion for the people because they have remained with Me now three days and have nothing to eat.	41
NASB	Mark	8	20	&ldquo;When I broke the seven for the four thousand, how many large baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up?&rdquo; And they said to Him, &ldquo;Seven.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	8	21	And He was saying to them, &ldquo;Do you not yet understand?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	8	22	And they came to Bethsaida. And they brought a blind man to Jesus and implored Him to touch him.	41
NASB	Mark	8	23	Taking the blind man by the hand, He brought him out of the village; and after spitting on his eyes and laying His hands on him, He asked him, &ldquo;Do you see anything?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	8	24	And he looked up and said, &ldquo;I see men, for I see them like trees, walking around.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	8	25	Then again He laid His hands on his eyes; and he looked intently and was restored, and began to see everything clearly.	41
NASB	Mark	8	26	And He sent him to his home, saying, &ldquo;Do not even enter the village.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	8	27	Jesus went out, along with His disciples, to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way He questioned His disciples, saying to them, &ldquo;Who do people say that I am?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	8	28	They told Him, saying, &ldquo;John the Baptist; and others say Elijah; but others, one of the prophets.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	8	29	And He continued by questioning them, &ldquo;But who do you say that I am?&rdquo; Peter answered and said to Him, &ldquo;You are the Christ.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	8	3	&ldquo;If I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come from a great distance.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	8	30	And He warned them to tell no one about Him.	41
NASB	Mark	8	31	And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.	41
NASB	Mark	8	32	And He was stating the matter plainly. And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him.	41
NASB	Mark	8	33	But turning around and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter and said, &ldquo;Get behind Me, Satan; for you are not setting your mind on God&rsquo;s interests, but man&rsquo;s.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	8	34	And He summoned the crowd with His disciples, and said to them, &ldquo;If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me.	41
NASB	Mark	8	35	&ldquo;For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospel&rsquo;s will save it.	41
NASB	Mark	8	36	&ldquo;For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul?	41
NASB	Mark	8	37	&ldquo;For what will a man give in exchange for his soul?	41
NASB	Mark	8	38	&ldquo;For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	8	4	And His disciples answered Him, &ldquo;Where will anyone be able to find enough bread here in this desolate place to satisfy these people?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	8	5	And He was asking them, &ldquo;How many loaves do you have?&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;Seven.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	8	6	And He directed the people to sit down on the ground; and taking the seven loaves, He gave thanks and broke them, and started giving them to His disciples to serve to them, and they served them to the people.	41
NASB	Mark	8	7	They also had a few small fish; and after He had blessed them, He ordered these to be served as well.	41
NASB	Mark	8	8	And they ate and were satisfied; and they picked up seven large baskets full of what was left over of the broken pieces.	41
NASB	Mark	8	9	About four thousand were there; and He sent them away.	41
NASB	Mark	9	1	And Jesus was saying to them, &ldquo;Truly I say to you, there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God after it has come with power.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	9	10	They seized upon that statement, discussing with one another what rising from the dead meant.	41
NASB	Mark	9	11	They asked Him, saying, &ldquo;Why is it that the scribes say that Elijah must come first?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	9	12	And He said to them, &ldquo;Elijah does first come and restore all things. And yet how is it written of the Son of Man that He will suffer many things and be treated with contempt?	41
NASB	Mark	9	13	&ldquo;But I say to you that Elijah has indeed come, and they did to him whatever they wished, just as it is written of him.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	9	14	When they came back to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them, and some scribes arguing with them.	41
NASB	Mark	9	15	Immediately, when the entire crowd saw Him, they were amazed and began running up to greet Him.	41
NASB	Mark	9	16	And He asked them, &ldquo;What are you discussing with them?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	9	17	And one of the crowd answered Him, &ldquo;Teacher, I brought You my son, possessed with a spirit which makes him mute;	41
NASB	Mark	9	18	And whenever it seizes him, it slams him to the ground and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth and stiffens out. I told Your disciples to cast it out, and they could not do it.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	9	19	And He answered them and said, &ldquo;O unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him to Me!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	9	2	Six days later, Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John, and brought them up on a high mountain by themselves. And He was transfigured before them;	41
NASB	Mark	9	20	They brought the boy to Him. When he saw Him, immediately the spirit threw him into a convulsion, and falling to the ground, he began rolling around and foaming at the mouth.	41
NASB	Mark	9	21	And He asked his father, &ldquo;How long has this been happening to him?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;From childhood.	41
NASB	Mark	9	22	&ldquo;It has often thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, take pity on us and help us!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	9	23	And Jesus said to him, &ldquo; &lsquo;If You can?&rsquo; All things are possible to him who believes.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	9	24	Immediately the boy&rsquo;s father cried out and said, &ldquo;I do believe; help my unbelief.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	9	25	When Jesus saw that a crowd was rapidly gathering, He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, &ldquo;You deaf and mute spirit, I command you, come out of him and do not enter him again.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	9	26	After crying out and throwing him into terrible convulsions, it came out; and the boy became so much like a corpse that most of them said, &ldquo;He is dead!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	9	27	But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him; and he got up.	41
NASB	Mark	9	28	When He came into the house, His disciples began questioning Him privately, &ldquo;Why could we not drive it out?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	9	29	And He said to them, &ldquo;This kind cannot come out by anything but prayer.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	9	3	And His garments became radiant and exceedingly white, as no launderer on earth can whiten them.	41
NASB	Mark	9	30	From there they went out and began to go through Galilee, and He did not want anyone to know about it.	41
NASB	Mark	9	31	For He was teaching His disciples and telling them, &ldquo;The Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill Him; and when He has been killed, He will rise three days later.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	9	32	But they did not understand this statement, and they were afraid to ask Him.	41
NASB	Mark	9	33	They came to Capernaum; and when He was in the house, He began to question them, &ldquo;What were you discussing on the way?&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	9	34	But they kept silent, for on the way they had discussed with one another which of them was the greatest.	41
NASB	Mark	9	35	Sitting down, He called the twelve and said to them, &ldquo;If anyone wants to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	9	36	Taking a child, He set him before them, and taking him in His arms, He said to them,	41
NASB	Mark	9	37	&ldquo;Whoever receives one child like this in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me does not receive Me, but Him who sent Me.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	9	38	John said to Him, &ldquo;Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we tried to prevent him because he was not following us.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	9	39	But Jesus said, &ldquo;Do not hinder him, for there is no one who will perform a miracle in My name, and be able soon afterward to speak evil of Me.	41
NASB	Mark	9	4	Elijah appeared to them along with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus.	41
NASB	Mark	9	40	&ldquo;For he who is not against us is for us.	41
NASB	Mark	9	41	&ldquo;For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because of your name as followers of Christ, truly I say to you, he will not lose his reward.	41
NASB	Mark	9	42	&ldquo;Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe to stumble, it would be better for him if, with a heavy millstone hung around his neck, he had been cast into the sea.	41
NASB	Mark	9	43	&ldquo;If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life crippled, than, having your two hands, to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire,	41
NASB	Mark	9	44	[where THEIR WORM DOES NOT DIE, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED.]	41
NASB	Mark	9	45	&ldquo;If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame, than, having your two feet, to be cast into hell,	41
NASB	Mark	9	46	[where THEIR WORM DOES NOT DIE, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED.]	41
NASB	Mark	9	47	&ldquo;If your eye causes you to stumble, throw it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, than, having two eyes, to be cast into hell,	41
NASB	Mark	9	48	Where THEIR WORM DOES NOT DIE, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED.	41
NASB	Mark	9	49	&ldquo;For everyone will be salted with fire.	41
NASB	Mark	9	5	Peter said to Jesus, &ldquo;Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	9	50	&ldquo;Salt is good; but if the salt becomes unsalty, with what will you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	9	6	For he did not know what to answer; for they became terrified.	41
NASB	Mark	9	7	Then a cloud formed, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, &ldquo;This is My beloved Son, listen to Him!&rdquo;	41
NASB	Mark	9	8	All at once they looked around and saw no one with them anymore, except Jesus alone.	41
NASB	Mark	9	9	As they were coming down from the mountain, He gave them orders not to relate to anyone what they had seen, until the Son of Man rose from the dead.	41
NASB	Matthew	1	1	The record of the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham:	40
NASB	Matthew	1	10	Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, and Amon the father of Josiah.	40
NASB	Matthew	1	11	Josiah became the father of Jeconiah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.	40
NASB	Matthew	1	12	After the deportation to Babylon: Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel.	40
NASB	Matthew	1	13	Zerubbabel was the father of Abihud, Abihud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor.	40
NASB	Matthew	1	14	Azor was the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud.	40
NASB	Matthew	1	15	Eliud was the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob.	40
NASB	Matthew	1	16	Jacob was the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born, who is called the Messiah.	40
NASB	Matthew	1	17	So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the deportation to Babylon to the Messiah, fourteen generations.	40
NASB	Matthew	1	18	Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: when His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.	40
NASB	Matthew	1	19	And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man and not wanting to disgrace her, planned to send her away secretly.	40
NASB	Matthew	1	2	Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers.	40
NASB	Matthew	1	20	But when he had considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, &ldquo;Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife; for the Child who has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.	40
NASB	Matthew	1	21	&ldquo;She will bear a Son; and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	1	22	Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet:	40
NASB	Matthew	1	23	&ldquo;BEHOLD, THE VIRGIN SHALL BE WITH CHILD AND SHALL BEAR A SON, AND THEY SHALL CALL HIS NAME IMMANUEL,&rdquo; which translated means, &ldquo;GOD WITH US.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	1	24	And Joseph awoke from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took Mary as his wife,	40
NASB	Matthew	1	25	But kept her a virgin until she gave birth to a Son; and he called His name Jesus.	40
NASB	Matthew	1	3	Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez was the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram.	40
NASB	Matthew	1	4	Ram was the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon.	40
NASB	Matthew	1	5	Salmon was the father of Boaz by Rahab, Boaz was the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse.	40
NASB	Matthew	1	6	Jesse was the father of David the king. David was the father of Solomon by Bathsheba who had been the wife of Uriah.	40
NASB	Matthew	1	7	Solomon was the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asa.	40
NASB	Matthew	1	8	Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah.	40
NASB	Matthew	1	9	Uzziah was the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	1	Jesus summoned His twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	10	Or a bag for your journey, or even two coats, or sandals, or a staff; for the worker is worthy of his support.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	11	&ldquo;And whatever city or village you enter, inquire who is worthy in it, and stay at his house until you leave that city.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	12	&ldquo;As you enter the house, give it your greeting.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	13	&ldquo;If the house is worthy, give it your blessing of peace. But if it is not worthy, take back your blessing of peace.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	14	&ldquo;Whoever does not receive you, nor heed your words, as you go out of that house or that city, shake the dust off your feet.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	15	&ldquo;Truly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	16	&ldquo;Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; so be shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	17	&ldquo;But beware of men, for they will hand you over to the courts and scourge you in their synagogues;	40
NASB	Matthew	10	18	And you will even be brought before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	19	&ldquo;But when they hand you over, do not worry about how or what you are to say; for it will be given you in that hour what you are to say.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	2	Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;	40
NASB	Matthew	10	20	&ldquo;For it is not you who speak, but it is the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	21	&ldquo;Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	22	&ldquo;You will be hated by all because of My name, but it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	23	&ldquo;But whenever they persecute you in one city, flee to the next; for truly I say to you, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	24	&ldquo;A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his master.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	25	&ldquo;It is enough for the disciple that he become like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have called the head of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign the members of his household!	40
NASB	Matthew	10	26	&ldquo;Therefore do not fear them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	27	&ldquo;What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in your ear, proclaim upon the housetops.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	28	&ldquo;Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	29	&ldquo;Are not two sparrows sold for a cent? And yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	3	Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;	40
NASB	Matthew	10	30	&ldquo;But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	31	&ldquo;So do not fear; you are more valuable than many sparrows.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	32	&ldquo;Therefore everyone who confesses Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father who is in heaven.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	33	&ldquo;But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	34	&ldquo;Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	35	&ldquo;For I came to SET A MAN AGAINST HIS FATHER, AND A DAUGHTER AGAINST HER MOTHER, AND A DAUGHTER-IN-LAW AGAINST HER MOTHER-IN-LAW;	40
NASB	Matthew	10	36	And A MAN&rsquo;s ENEMIES WILL BE THE MEMBERS OF HIS HOUSEHOLD.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	37	&ldquo;He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	38	&ldquo;And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	39	&ldquo;He who has found his life will lose it, and he who has lost his life for My sake will find it.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	4	Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	40	&ldquo;He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	41	&ldquo;He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet&rsquo;s reward; and he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man&rsquo;s reward.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	42	&ldquo;And whoever in the name of a disciple gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water to drink, truly I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	10	5	These twelve Jesus sent out after instructing them: &ldquo;Do not go in the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter any city of the Samaritans;	40
NASB	Matthew	10	6	But rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	7	&ldquo;And as you go, preach, saying, &lsquo;The kingdom of heaven is at hand.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	10	8	&ldquo;Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. Freely you received, freely give.	40
NASB	Matthew	10	9	&ldquo;Do not acquire gold, or silver, or copper for your money belts,	40
NASB	Matthew	11	1	When Jesus had finished giving instructions to His twelve disciples, He departed from there to teach and preach in their cities.	40
NASB	Matthew	11	10	&ldquo;This is the one about whom it is written, &lsquo;BEHOLD, I SEND MY MESSENGER AHEAD OF YOU, WHO WILL PREPARE YOUR WAY BEFORE YOU.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	11	11	&ldquo;Truly I say to you, among those born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptist! Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.	40
NASB	Matthew	11	12	&ldquo;From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and violent men take it by force.	40
NASB	Matthew	11	13	&ldquo;For all the prophets and the Law prophesied until John.	40
NASB	Matthew	11	14	&ldquo;And if you are willing to accept it, John himself is Elijah who was to come.	40
NASB	Matthew	11	15	&ldquo;He who has ears to hear, let him hear.	40
NASB	Matthew	11	16	&ldquo;But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the market places, who call out to the other children,	40
NASB	Matthew	11	17	And say, &lsquo;We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	11	18	&ldquo;For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, &lsquo;He has a demon!&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	11	19	&ldquo;The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, &lsquo;Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!&rsquo; Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	11	2	Now when John, while imprisoned, heard of the works of Christ, he sent word by his disciples	40
NASB	Matthew	11	20	Then He began to denounce the cities in which most of His miracles were done, because they did not repent.	40
NASB	Matthew	11	21	&ldquo;Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles had occurred in Tyre and Sidon which occurred in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.	40
NASB	Matthew	11	22	&ldquo;Nevertheless I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.	40
NASB	Matthew	11	23	&ldquo;And you, Capernaum, will not be exalted to heaven, will you? You will descend to Hades; for if the miracles had occurred in Sodom which occurred in you, it would have remained to this day.	40
NASB	Matthew	11	24	&ldquo;Nevertheless I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for you.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	11	25	At that time Jesus said, &ldquo;I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants.	40
NASB	Matthew	11	26	&ldquo;Yes, Father, for this way was well-pleasing in Your sight.	40
NASB	Matthew	11	27	&ldquo;All things have been handed over to Me by My Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father; nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	11	28	&ldquo;Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.	40
NASB	Matthew	11	29	&ldquo;Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and YOU WILL FIND REST FOR YOUR SOULS.	40
NASB	Matthew	11	3	And said to Him, &ldquo;Are You the Expected One, or shall we look for someone else?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	11	30	&ldquo;For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	11	4	Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Go and report to John what you hear and see:	40
NASB	Matthew	11	5	The BLIND RECEIVE SIGHT and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the POOR HAVE THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO THEM.	40
NASB	Matthew	11	6	&ldquo;And blessed is he who does not take offense at Me.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	11	7	As these men were going away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John, &ldquo;What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?	40
NASB	Matthew	11	8	&ldquo;But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Those who wear soft clothing are in kings&rsquo; palaces!	40
NASB	Matthew	11	9	&ldquo;But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and one who is more than a prophet.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	1	At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples became hungry and began to pick the heads of grain and eat.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	10	And a man was there whose hand was withered. And they questioned Jesus, asking, &ldquo;Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?&rdquo;&mdash;so that they might accuse Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	11	And He said to them, &ldquo;What man is there among you who has a sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will he not take hold of it and lift it out?	40
NASB	Matthew	12	12	&ldquo;How much more valuable then is a man than a sheep! So then, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	12	13	Then He said to the man, &ldquo;Stretch out your hand!&rdquo; He stretched it out, and it was restored to normal, like the other.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	14	But the Pharisees went out and conspired against Him, as to how they might destroy Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	15	But Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there. Many followed Him, and He healed them all,	40
NASB	Matthew	12	16	And warned them not to tell who He was.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	17	This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet:	40
NASB	Matthew	12	18	&ldquo;BEHOLD, MY SERVANT WHOM I HAVE CHOSEN; MY BELOVED IN WHOM MY SOUL is WELL-PLEASED; I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT UPON HIM, AND HE SHALL PROCLAIM JUSTICE TO THE GENTILES.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	19	&ldquo;HE WILL NOT QUARREL, NOR CRY OUT; NOR WILL ANYONE HEAR HIS VOICE IN THE STREETS.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	2	But when the Pharisees saw this, they said to Him, &ldquo;Look, Your disciples do what is not lawful to do on a Sabbath.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	12	20	&ldquo;A BATTERED REED HE WILL NOT BREAK OFF, AND A SMOLDERING WICK HE WILL NOT PUT OUT, UNTIL HE LEADS JUSTICE TO VICTORY.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	21	&ldquo;AND IN HIS NAME THE GENTILES WILL HOPE.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	12	22	Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to Jesus, and He healed him, so that the mute man spoke and saw.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	23	All the crowds were amazed, and were saying, &ldquo;This man cannot be the Son of David, can he?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	12	24	But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, &ldquo;This man casts out demons only by Beelzebul the ruler of the demons.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	12	25	And knowing their thoughts Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Any kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and any city or house divided against itself will not stand.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	26	&ldquo;If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?	40
NASB	Matthew	12	27	&ldquo;If I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? For this reason they will be your judges.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	28	&ldquo;But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	29	&ldquo;Or how can anyone enter the strong man&rsquo;s house and carry off his property, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	3	But He said to them, &ldquo;Have you not read what David did when he became hungry, he and his companions,	40
NASB	Matthew	12	30	&ldquo;He who is not with Me is against Me; and he who does not gather with Me scatters.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	31	&ldquo;Therefore I say to you, any sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	32	&ldquo;Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	33	&ldquo;Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad; for the tree is known by its fruit.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	34	&ldquo;You brood of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak what is good? For the mouth speaks out of that which fills the heart.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	35	&ldquo;The good man brings out of his good treasure what is good; and the evil man brings out of his evil treasure what is evil.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	36	&ldquo;But I tell you that every careless word that people speak, they shall give an accounting for it in the day of judgment.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	37	&ldquo;For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	12	38	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him, &ldquo;Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	12	39	But He answered and said to them, &ldquo;An evil and adulterous generation craves for a sign; and yet no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet;	40
NASB	Matthew	12	4	How he entered the house of God, and they ate the consecrated bread, which was not lawful for him to eat nor for those with him, but for the priests alone?	40
NASB	Matthew	12	40	For just as JONAH WAS THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS IN THE BELLY OF THE SEA MONSTER, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	41	&ldquo;The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment, and will condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	42	&ldquo;The Queen of the South will rise up with this generation at the judgment and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	43	&ldquo;Now when the unclean spirit goes out of a man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and does not find it.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	44	&ldquo;Then it says, &lsquo;I will return to my house from which I came&rsquo;; and when it comes, it finds it unoccupied, swept, and put in order.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	45	&ldquo;Then it goes and takes along with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. That is the way it will also be with this evil generation.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	12	46	While He was still speaking to the crowds, behold, His mother and brothers were standing outside, seeking to speak to Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	47	Someone said to Him, &ldquo;Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside seeking to speak to You.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	12	48	But Jesus answered the one who was telling Him and said, &ldquo;Who is My mother and who are My brothers?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	12	49	And stretching out His hand toward His disciples, He said, &ldquo;Behold My mother and My brothers!	40
NASB	Matthew	12	5	&ldquo;Or have you not read in the Law, that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple break the Sabbath and are innocent?	40
NASB	Matthew	12	50	&ldquo;For whoever does the will of My Father who is in heaven, he is My brother and sister and mother.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	12	6	&ldquo;But I say to you that something greater than the temple is here.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	7	&ldquo;But if you had known what this means, &lsquo;I DESIRE COMPASSION, AND NOT A SACRIFICE,&rsquo; you would not have condemned the innocent.	40
NASB	Matthew	12	8	&ldquo;For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	12	9	Departing from there, He went into their synagogue.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	1	That day Jesus went out of the house and was sitting by the sea.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	10	And the disciples came and said to Him, &ldquo;Why do You speak to them in parables?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	13	11	Jesus answered them, &ldquo;To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been granted.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	12	&ldquo;For whoever has, to him more shall be given, and he will have an abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	13	&ldquo;Therefore I speak to them in parables; because while seeing they do not see, and while hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	14	&ldquo;In their case the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says, &lsquo;YOU WILL KEEP ON HEARING, BUT WILL NOT UNDERSTAND; YOU WILL KEEP ON SEEING, BUT WILL NOT PERCEIVE;	40
NASB	Matthew	13	15	FOR THE HEART OF THIS PEOPLE HAS BECOME DULL, WITH THEIR EARS THEY SCARCELY HEAR, AND THEY HAVE CLOSED THEIR EYES, OTHERWISE THEY WOULD SEE WITH THEIR EYES, HEAR WITH THEIR EARS, AND UNDERSTAND WITH THEIR HEART AND RETURN, AND I WOULD HEAL THEM.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	13	16	&ldquo;But blessed are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	17	&ldquo;For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	18	&ldquo;Hear then the parable of the sower.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	19	&ldquo;When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is the one on whom seed was sown beside the road.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	2	And large crowds gathered to Him, so He got into a boat and sat down, and the whole crowd was standing on the beach.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	20	&ldquo;The one on whom seed was sown on the rocky places, this is the man who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy;	40
NASB	Matthew	13	21	Yet he has no firm root in himself, but is only temporary, and when affliction or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he falls away.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	22	&ldquo;And the one on whom seed was sown among the thorns, this is the man who hears the word, and the worry of the world and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	23	&ldquo;And the one on whom seed was sown on the good soil, this is the man who hears the word and understands it; who indeed bears fruit and brings forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	13	24	Jesus presented another parable to them, saying, &ldquo;The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	25	&ldquo;But while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	26	&ldquo;But when the wheat sprouted and bore grain, then the tares became evident also.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	27	&ldquo;The slaves of the landowner came and said to him, &lsquo;Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	13	28	&ldquo;And he said to them, &lsquo;An enemy has done this!&rsquo; The slaves said to him, &lsquo;Do you want us, then, to go and gather them up?&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	13	29	&ldquo;But he said, &lsquo;No; for while you are gathering up the tares, you may uproot the wheat with them.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	3	And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying, &ldquo;Behold, the sower went out to sow;	40
NASB	Matthew	13	30	&lsquo;Allow both to grow together until the harvest; and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, &ldquo;First gather up the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them up; but gather the wheat into my barn.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	13	31	He presented another parable to them, saying, &ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field;	40
NASB	Matthew	13	32	And this is smaller than all other seeds, but when it is full grown, it is larger than the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that THE BIRDS OF THE AIR come and NEST IN ITS BRANCHES.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	13	33	He spoke another parable to them, &ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three pecks of flour until it was all leavened.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	13	34	All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and He did not speak to them without a parable.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	35	This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet: &ldquo;I WILL OPEN MY MOUTH IN PARABLES; I WILL UTTER THINGS HIDDEN SINCE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	13	36	Then He left the crowds and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him and said, &ldquo;Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	13	37	And He said, &ldquo;The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,	40
NASB	Matthew	13	38	And the field is the world; and as for the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil one;	40
NASB	Matthew	13	39	And the enemy who sowed them is the devil, and the harvest is the end of the age; and the reapers are angels.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	4	And as he sowed, some seeds fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate them up.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	40	&ldquo;So just as the tares are gathered up and burned with fire, so shall it be at the end of the age.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	41	&ldquo;The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all stumbling blocks, and those who commit lawlessness,	40
NASB	Matthew	13	42	And will throw them into the furnace of fire; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	43	&ldquo;Then THE RIGHTEOUS WILL SHINE FORTH AS THE SUN in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	44	&ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid again; and from joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	45	&ldquo;Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls,	40
NASB	Matthew	13	46	And upon finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	47	&ldquo;Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet cast into the sea, and gathering fish of every kind;	40
NASB	Matthew	13	48	And when it was filled, they drew it up on the beach; and they sat down and gathered the good fish into containers, but the bad they threw away.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	49	&ldquo;So it will be at the end of the age; the angels will come forth and take out the wicked from among the righteous,	40
NASB	Matthew	13	5	&ldquo;Others fell on the rocky places, where they did not have much soil; and immediately they sprang up, because they had no depth of soil.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	50	And will throw them into the furnace of fire; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	51	&ldquo;Have you understood all these things?&rdquo; They said to Him, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	13	52	And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a head of a household, who brings out of his treasure things new and old.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	13	53	When Jesus had finished these parables, He departed from there.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	54	He came to His hometown and began teaching them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, &ldquo;Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?	40
NASB	Matthew	13	55	&ldquo;Is not this the carpenter&rsquo;s son? Is not His mother called Mary, and His brothers, James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?	40
NASB	Matthew	13	56	&ldquo;And His sisters, are they not all with us? Where then did this man get all these things?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	13	57	And they took offense at Him. But Jesus said to them, &ldquo;A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	13	58	And He did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	6	&ldquo;But when the sun had risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	7	&ldquo;Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them out.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	8	&ldquo;And others fell on the good soil and yielded a crop, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.	40
NASB	Matthew	13	9	&ldquo;He who has ears, let him hear.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	14	1	At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the news about Jesus,	40
NASB	Matthew	14	10	He sent and had John beheaded in the prison.	40
NASB	Matthew	14	11	And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.	40
NASB	Matthew	14	12	His disciples came and took away the body and buried it; and they went and reported to Jesus.	40
NASB	Matthew	14	13	Now when Jesus heard about John, He withdrew from there in a boat to a secluded place by Himself; and when the people heard of this, they followed Him on foot from the cities.	40
NASB	Matthew	14	14	When He went ashore, He saw a large crowd, and felt compassion for them and healed their sick.	40
NASB	Matthew	14	15	When it was evening, the disciples came to Him and said, &ldquo;This place is desolate and the hour is already late; so send the crowds away, that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	14	16	But Jesus said to them, &ldquo;They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat!&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	14	17	They said to Him, &ldquo;We have here only five loaves and two fish.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	14	18	And He said, &ldquo;Bring them here to Me.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	14	19	Ordering the people to sit down on the grass, He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up toward heaven, He blessed the food, and breaking the loaves He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds,	40
NASB	Matthew	14	2	And said to his servants, &ldquo;This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	14	20	And they all ate and were satisfied. They picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, twelve full baskets.	40
NASB	Matthew	14	21	There were about five thousand men who ate, besides women and children.	40
NASB	Matthew	14	22	Immediately He made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side, while He sent the crowds away.	40
NASB	Matthew	14	23	After He had sent the crowds away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray; and when it was evening, He was there alone.	40
NASB	Matthew	14	24	But the boat was already a long distance from the land, battered by the waves; for the wind was contrary.	40
NASB	Matthew	14	25	And in the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea.	40
NASB	Matthew	14	26	When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, &ldquo;It is a ghost!&rdquo; And they cried out in fear.	40
NASB	Matthew	14	27	But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, &ldquo;Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	14	28	Peter said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	14	29	And He said, &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; And Peter got out of the boat, and walked on the water and came toward Jesus.	40
NASB	Matthew	14	3	For when Herod had John arrested, he bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.	40
NASB	Matthew	14	30	But seeing the wind, he became frightened, and beginning to sink, he cried out, &ldquo;Lord, save me!&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	14	31	Immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of him, and said to him, &ldquo;You of little faith, why did you doubt?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	14	32	When they got into the boat, the wind stopped.	40
NASB	Matthew	14	33	And those who were in the boat worshiped Him, saying, &ldquo;You are certainly God&rsquo;s Son!&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	14	34	When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.	40
NASB	Matthew	14	35	And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent word into all that surrounding district and brought to Him all who were sick;	40
NASB	Matthew	14	36	And they implored Him that they might just touch the fringe of His cloak; and as many as touched it were cured.	40
NASB	Matthew	14	4	For John had been saying to him, &ldquo;It is not lawful for you to have her.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	14	5	Although Herod wanted to put him to death, he feared the crowd, because they regarded John as a prophet.	40
NASB	Matthew	14	6	But when Herod&rsquo;s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod,	40
NASB	Matthew	14	7	So much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.	40
NASB	Matthew	14	8	Having been prompted by her mother, she said, &ldquo;Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	14	9	Although he was grieved, the king commanded it to be given because of his oaths, and because of his dinner guests.	40
NASB	Matthew	15	1	Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said,	40
NASB	Matthew	15	10	After Jesus called the crowd to Him, He said to them, &ldquo;Hear and understand.	40
NASB	Matthew	15	11	&ldquo;It is not what enters into the mouth that defiles the man, but what proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	15	12	Then the disciples came and said to Him, &ldquo;Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this statement?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	15	13	But He answered and said, &ldquo;Every plant which My heavenly Father did not plant shall be uprooted.	40
NASB	Matthew	15	14	&ldquo;Let them alone; they are blind guides of the blind. And if a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	15	15	Peter said to Him, &ldquo;Explain the parable to us.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	15	16	Jesus said, &ldquo;Are you still lacking in understanding also?	40
NASB	Matthew	15	17	&ldquo;Do you not understand that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach, and is eliminated?	40
NASB	Matthew	15	18	&ldquo;But the things that proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and those defile the man.	40
NASB	Matthew	15	19	&ldquo;For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, slanders.	40
NASB	Matthew	15	2	&ldquo;Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	15	20	&ldquo;These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	15	21	Jesus went away from there, and withdrew into the district of Tyre and Sidon.	40
NASB	Matthew	15	22	And a Canaanite woman from that region came out and began to cry out, saying, &ldquo;Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is cruelly demon-possessed.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	15	23	But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and implored Him, saying, &ldquo;Send her away, because she keeps shouting at us.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	15	24	But He answered and said, &ldquo;I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	15	25	But she came and began to bow down before Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, help me!&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	15	26	And He answered and said, &ldquo;It is not good to take the children&rsquo;s bread and throw it to the dogs.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	15	27	But she said, &ldquo;Yes, Lord; but even the dogs feed on the crumbs which fall from their masters&rsquo; table.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	15	28	Then Jesus said to her, &ldquo;O woman, your faith is great; it shall be done for you as you wish.&rdquo; And her daughter was healed at once.	40
NASB	Matthew	15	29	Departing from there, Jesus went along by the Sea of Galilee, and having gone up on the mountain, He was sitting there.	40
NASB	Matthew	15	3	And He answered and said to them, &ldquo;Why do you yourselves transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?	40
NASB	Matthew	15	30	And large crowds came to Him, bringing with them those who were lame, crippled, blind, mute, and many others, and they laid them down at His feet; and He healed them.	40
NASB	Matthew	15	31	So the crowd marveled as they saw the mute speaking, the crippled restored, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.	40
NASB	Matthew	15	32	And Jesus called His disciples to Him, and said, &ldquo;I feel compassion for the people, because they have remained with Me now three days and have nothing to eat; and I do not want to send them away hungry, for they might faint on the way.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	15	33	The disciples said to Him, &ldquo;Where would we get so many loaves in this desolate place to satisfy such a large crowd?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	15	34	And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;How many loaves do you have?&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;Seven, and a few small fish.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	15	35	And He directed the people to sit down on the ground;	40
NASB	Matthew	15	36	And He took the seven loaves and the fish; and giving thanks, He broke them and started giving them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.	40
NASB	Matthew	15	37	And they all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, seven large baskets full.	40
NASB	Matthew	15	38	And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.	40
NASB	Matthew	15	39	And sending away the crowds, Jesus got into the boat and came to the region of Magadan.	40
NASB	Matthew	15	4	&ldquo;For God said, &lsquo;HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER,&rsquo; and, &lsquo;HE WHO SPEAKS EVIL OF FATHER OR MOTHER IS TO BE PUT TO DEATH.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	15	5	&ldquo;But you say, &lsquo;Whoever says to his father or mother, &ldquo;Whatever I have that would help you has been given to God,&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	15	6	He is not to honor his father or his mother.&rsquo; And by this you invalidated the word of God for the sake of your tradition.	40
NASB	Matthew	15	7	&ldquo;You hypocrites, rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you:	40
NASB	Matthew	15	8	&lsquo;THIS PEOPLE HONORS ME WITH THEIR LIPS, BUT THEIR HEART IS FAR AWAY FROM ME.	40
NASB	Matthew	15	9	&lsquo;BUT IN VAIN DO THEY WORSHIP ME, TEACHING AS DOCTRINES THE PRECEPTS OF MEN.&rsquo;&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	16	1	The Pharisees and Sadducees came up, and testing Jesus, they asked Him to show them a sign from heaven.	40
NASB	Matthew	16	10	&ldquo;Or the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many large baskets full you picked up?	40
NASB	Matthew	16	11	&ldquo;How is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	16	12	Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.	40
NASB	Matthew	16	13	Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, He was asking His disciples, &ldquo;Who do people say that the Son of Man is?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	16	14	And they said, &ldquo;Some say John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but still others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	16	15	He said to them, &ldquo;But who do you say that I am?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	16	16	Simon Peter answered, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	16	17	And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in heaven.	40
NASB	Matthew	16	18	&ldquo;I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.	40
NASB	Matthew	16	19	&ldquo;I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	16	2	But He replied to them, &ldquo;When it is evening, you say, &lsquo;It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	16	20	Then He warned the disciples that they should tell no one that He was the Christ.	40
NASB	Matthew	16	21	From that time Jesus began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised up on the third day.	40
NASB	Matthew	16	22	Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, &ldquo;God forbid it, Lord! This shall never happen to You.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	16	23	But He turned and said to Peter, &ldquo;Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me; for you are not setting your mind on God&rsquo;s interests, but man&rsquo;s.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	16	24	Then Jesus said to His disciples, &ldquo;If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me.	40
NASB	Matthew	16	25	&ldquo;For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.	40
NASB	Matthew	16	26	&ldquo;For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?	40
NASB	Matthew	16	27	&ldquo;For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and WILL THEN REPAY EVERY MAN ACCORDING TO HIS DEEDS.	40
NASB	Matthew	16	28	&ldquo;Truly I say to you, there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	16	3	&ldquo;And in the morning, &lsquo;There will be a storm today, for the sky is red and threatening.&rsquo; Do you know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but cannot discern the signs of the times?	40
NASB	Matthew	16	4	&ldquo;An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and a sign will not be given it, except the sign of Jonah.&rdquo; And He left them and went away.	40
NASB	Matthew	16	5	And the disciples came to the other side of the sea, but they had forgotten to bring any bread.	40
NASB	Matthew	16	6	And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Watch out and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	16	7	They began to discuss this among themselves, saying, &ldquo;He said that because we did not bring any bread.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	16	8	But Jesus, aware of this, said, &ldquo;You men of little faith, why do you discuss among yourselves that you have no bread?	40
NASB	Matthew	16	9	&ldquo;Do you not yet understand or remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets full you picked up?	40
NASB	Matthew	17	1	Six days later Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and led them up on a high mountain by themselves.	40
NASB	Matthew	17	10	And His disciples asked Him, &ldquo;Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	17	11	And He answered and said, &ldquo;Elijah is coming and will restore all things;	40
NASB	Matthew	17	12	But I say to you that Elijah already came, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they wished. So also the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	17	13	Then the disciples understood that He had spoken to them about John the Baptist.	40
NASB	Matthew	17	14	When they came to the crowd, a man came up to Jesus, falling on his knees before Him and saying,	40
NASB	Matthew	17	15	&ldquo;Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is a lunatic and is very ill; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water.	40
NASB	Matthew	17	16	&ldquo;I brought him to Your disciples, and they could not cure him.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	17	17	And Jesus answered and said, &ldquo;You unbelieving and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him here to Me.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	17	18	And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him, and the boy was cured at once.	40
NASB	Matthew	17	19	Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, &ldquo;Why could we not drive it out?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	17	2	And He was transfigured before them; and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as light.	40
NASB	Matthew	17	20	And He said to them, &ldquo;Because of the littleness of your faith; for truly I say to you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, &lsquo;Move from here to there,&rsquo; and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.	40
NASB	Matthew	17	21	[&ldquo;But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.&rdquo;]	40
NASB	Matthew	17	22	And while they were gathering together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, &ldquo;The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men;	40
NASB	Matthew	17	23	And they will kill Him, and He will be raised on the third day.&rdquo; And they were deeply grieved.	40
NASB	Matthew	17	24	When they came to Capernaum, those who collected the two-drachma tax came to Peter and said, &ldquo;Does your teacher not pay the two-drachma tax?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	17	25	He said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, &ldquo;What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect customs or poll-tax, from their sons or from strangers?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	17	26	When Peter said, &ldquo;From strangers,&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Then the sons are exempt.	40
NASB	Matthew	17	27	&ldquo;However, so that we do not offend them, go to the sea and throw in a hook, and take the first fish that comes up; and when you open its mouth, you will find a shekel. Take that and give it to them for you and Me.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	17	3	And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	17	4	Peter said to Jesus, &ldquo;Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You wish, I will make three tabernacles here, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	17	5	While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud said, &ldquo;This is My beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased; listen to Him!&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	17	6	When the disciples heard this, they fell face down to the ground and were terrified.	40
NASB	Matthew	17	7	And Jesus came to them and touched them and said, &ldquo;Get up, and do not be afraid.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	17	8	And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone.	40
NASB	Matthew	17	9	As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, &ldquo;Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	18	1	At that time the disciples came to Jesus and said, &ldquo;Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	18	10	&ldquo;See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in heaven continually see the face of My Father who is in heaven.	40
NASB	Matthew	18	11	[&ldquo;For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.]	40
NASB	Matthew	18	12	&ldquo;What do you think? If any man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and search for the one that is straying?	40
NASB	Matthew	18	13	&ldquo;If it turns out that he finds it, truly I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray.	40
NASB	Matthew	18	14	&ldquo;So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones perish.	40
NASB	Matthew	18	15	&ldquo;If your brother sins, go and show him his fault in private; if he listens to you, you have won your brother.	40
NASB	Matthew	18	16	&ldquo;But if he does not listen to you, take one or two more with you, so that BY THE MOUTH OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES EVERY FACT MAY BE CONFIRMED.	40
NASB	Matthew	18	17	&ldquo;If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.	40
NASB	Matthew	18	18	&ldquo;Truly I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven.	40
NASB	Matthew	18	19	&ldquo;Again I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about anything that they may ask, it shall be done for them by My Father who is in heaven.	40
NASB	Matthew	18	2	And He called a child to Himself and set him before them,	40
NASB	Matthew	18	20	&ldquo;For where two or three have gathered together in My name, I am there in their midst.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	18	21	Then Peter came and said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	18	22	Jesus said to him, &ldquo;I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven.	40
NASB	Matthew	18	23	&ldquo;For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves.	40
NASB	Matthew	18	24	&ldquo;When he had begun to settle them, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him.	40
NASB	Matthew	18	25	&ldquo;But since he did not have the means to repay, his lord commanded him to be sold, along with his wife and children and all that he had, and repayment to be made.	40
NASB	Matthew	18	26	&ldquo;So the slave fell to the ground and prostrated himself before him, saying, &lsquo;Have patience with me and I will repay you everything.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	18	27	&ldquo;And the lord of that slave felt compassion and released him and forgave him the debt.	40
NASB	Matthew	18	28	&ldquo;But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii; and he seized him and began to choke him, saying, &lsquo;Pay back what you owe.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	18	29	&ldquo;So his fellow slave fell to the ground and began to plead with him, saying, &lsquo;Have patience with me and I will repay you.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	18	3	And said, &ldquo;Truly I say to you, unless you are converted and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.	40
NASB	Matthew	18	30	&ldquo;But he was unwilling and went and threw him in prison until he should pay back what was owed.	40
NASB	Matthew	18	31	&ldquo;So when his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were deeply grieved and came and reported to their lord all that had happened.	40
NASB	Matthew	18	32	&ldquo;Then summoning him, his lord said to him, &lsquo;You wicked slave, I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.	40
NASB	Matthew	18	33	&lsquo;Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave, in the same way that I had mercy on you?&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	18	34	&ldquo;And his lord, moved with anger, handed him over to the torturers until he should repay all that was owed him.	40
NASB	Matthew	18	35	&ldquo;My heavenly Father will also do the same to you, if each of you does not forgive his brother from your heart.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	18	4	&ldquo;Whoever then humbles himself as this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.	40
NASB	Matthew	18	5	&ldquo;And whoever receives one such child in My name receives Me;	40
NASB	Matthew	18	6	But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck, and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.	40
NASB	Matthew	18	7	&ldquo;Woe to the world because of its stumbling blocks! For it is inevitable that stumbling blocks come; but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes!	40
NASB	Matthew	18	8	&ldquo;If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it from you; it is better for you to enter life crippled or lame, than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire.	40
NASB	Matthew	18	9	&ldquo;If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it from you. It is better for you to enter life with one eye, than to have two eyes and be cast into the fiery hell.	40
NASB	Matthew	19	1	When Jesus had finished these words, He departed from Galilee and came into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan;	40
NASB	Matthew	19	10	The disciples said to Him, &ldquo;If the relationship of the man with his wife is like this, it is better not to marry.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	19	11	But He said to them, &ldquo;Not all men can accept this statement, but only those to whom it has been given.	40
NASB	Matthew	19	12	&ldquo;For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother&rsquo;s womb; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are also eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to accept this, let him accept it.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	19	13	Then some children were brought to Him so that He might lay His hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them.	40
NASB	Matthew	19	14	But Jesus said, &ldquo;Let the children alone, and do not hinder them from coming to Me; for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	19	15	After laying His hands on them, He departed from there.	40
NASB	Matthew	19	16	And someone came to Him and said, &ldquo;Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may obtain eternal life?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	19	17	And He said to him, &ldquo;Why are you asking Me about what is good? There is only One who is good; but if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	19	18	Then he said to Him, &ldquo;Which ones?&rdquo; And Jesus said, &ldquo;YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT MURDER; YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY; YOU SHALL NOT STEAL; YOU SHALL NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS;	40
NASB	Matthew	19	19	HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER; and YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	19	2	And large crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.	40
NASB	Matthew	19	20	The young man said to Him, &ldquo;All these things I have kept; what am I still lacking?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	19	21	Jesus said to him, &ldquo;If you wish to be complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	19	22	But when the young man heard this statement, he went away grieving; for he was one who owned much property.	40
NASB	Matthew	19	23	And Jesus said to His disciples, &ldquo;Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.	40
NASB	Matthew	19	24	&ldquo;Again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	19	25	When the disciples heard this, they were very astonished and said, &ldquo;Then who can be saved?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	19	26	And looking at them Jesus said to them, &ldquo;With people this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	19	27	Then Peter said to Him, &ldquo;Behold, we have left everything and followed You; what then will there be for us?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	19	28	And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Truly I say to you, that you who have followed Me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on His glorious throne, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.	40
NASB	Matthew	19	29	&ldquo;And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or farms for My name&rsquo;s sake, will receive many times as much, and will inherit eternal life.	40
NASB	Matthew	19	3	Some Pharisees came to Jesus, testing Him and asking, &ldquo;Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	19	30	&ldquo;But many who are first will be last; and the last, first.	40
NASB	Matthew	19	4	And He answered and said, &ldquo;Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE,	40
NASB	Matthew	19	5	And said, &lsquo;FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH&rsquo;?	40
NASB	Matthew	19	6	&ldquo;So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	19	7	They said to Him, &ldquo;Why then did Moses command to GIVE HER A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE AND SEND her AWAY?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	19	8	He said to them, &ldquo;Because of your hardness of heart Moses permitted you to divorce your wives; but from the beginning it has not been this way.	40
NASB	Matthew	19	9	&ldquo;And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	2	1	Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying,	40
NASB	Matthew	2	10	When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.	40
NASB	Matthew	2	11	After coming into the house they saw the Child with Mary His mother; and they fell to the ground and worshiped Him. Then, opening their treasures, they presented to Him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.	40
NASB	Matthew	2	12	And having been warned by God in a dream not to return to Herod, the magi left for their own country by another way.	40
NASB	Matthew	2	13	Now when they had gone, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, &ldquo;Get up! Take the Child and His mother and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is going to search for the Child to destroy Him.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	2	14	So Joseph got up and took the Child and His mother while it was still night, and left for Egypt.	40
NASB	Matthew	2	15	He remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet: &ldquo;OUT OF EGYPT I CALLED MY SON.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	2	16	Then when Herod saw that he had been tricked by the magi, he became very enraged, and sent and slew all the male children who were in Bethlehem and all its vicinity, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the magi.	40
NASB	Matthew	2	17	Then what had been spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled:	40
NASB	Matthew	2	18	&ldquo;A VOICE WAS HEARD IN RAMAH, WEEPING AND GREAT MOURNING, RACHEL WEEPING FOR HER CHILDREN; AND SHE REFUSED TO BE COMFORTED, BECAUSE THEY WERE NO MORE.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	2	19	But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and said,	40
NASB	Matthew	2	2	&ldquo;Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	2	20	&ldquo;Get up, take the Child and His mother, and go into the land of Israel; for those who sought the Child&rsquo;s life are dead.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	2	21	So Joseph got up, took the Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel.	40
NASB	Matthew	2	22	But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Then after being warned by God in a dream, he left for the regions of Galilee,	40
NASB	Matthew	2	23	And came and lived in a city called Nazareth. This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophets: &ldquo;He shall be called a Nazarene.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	2	3	When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.	40
NASB	Matthew	2	4	Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born.	40
NASB	Matthew	2	5	They said to him, &ldquo;In Bethlehem of Judea; for this is what has been written by the prophet:	40
NASB	Matthew	2	6	&lsquo;AND YOU, BETHLEHEM, LAND OF JUDAH, ARE BY NO MEANS LEAST AMONG THE LEADERS OF JUDAH; FOR OUT OF YOU SHALL COME FORTH A RULER WHO WILL SHEPHERD MY PEOPLE ISRAEL.&rsquo;&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	2	7	Then Herod secretly called the magi and determined from them the exact time the star appeared.	40
NASB	Matthew	2	8	And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, &ldquo;Go and search carefully for the Child; and when you have found Him, report to me, so that I too may come and worship Him.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	2	9	After hearing the king, they went their way; and the star, which they had seen in the east, went on before them until it came and stood over the place where the Child was.	40
NASB	Matthew	20	1	&ldquo;For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.	40
NASB	Matthew	20	10	&ldquo;When those hired first came, they thought that they would receive more; but each of them also received a denarius.	40
NASB	Matthew	20	11	&ldquo;When they received it, they grumbled at the landowner,	40
NASB	Matthew	20	12	Saying, &lsquo;These last men have worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the scorching heat of the day.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	20	13	&ldquo;But he answered and said to one of them, &lsquo;Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for a denarius?	40
NASB	Matthew	20	14	&lsquo;Take what is yours and go, but I wish to give to this last man the same as to you.	40
NASB	Matthew	20	15	&lsquo;Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is my own? Or is your eye envious because I am generous?&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	20	16	&ldquo;So the last shall be first, and the first last.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	20	17	As Jesus was about to go up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside by themselves, and on the way He said to them,	40
NASB	Matthew	20	18	&ldquo;Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn Him to death,	40
NASB	Matthew	20	19	And will hand Him over to the Gentiles to mock and scourge and crucify Him, and on the third day He will be raised up.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	20	2	&ldquo;When he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard.	40
NASB	Matthew	20	20	Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons, bowing down and making a request of Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	20	21	And He said to her, &ldquo;What do you wish?&rdquo; She said to Him, &ldquo;Command that in Your kingdom these two sons of mine may sit one on Your right and one on Your left.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	20	22	But Jesus answered, &ldquo;You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?&rdquo; They said to Him, &ldquo;We are able.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	20	23	He said to them, &ldquo;My cup you shall drink; but to sit on My right and on My left, this is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	20	24	And hearing this, the ten became indignant with the two brothers.	40
NASB	Matthew	20	25	But Jesus called them to Himself and said, &ldquo;You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them.	40
NASB	Matthew	20	26	&ldquo;It is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant,	40
NASB	Matthew	20	27	And whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave;	40
NASB	Matthew	20	28	Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	20	29	As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	20	3	&ldquo;And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the market place;	40
NASB	Matthew	20	30	And two blind men sitting by the road, hearing that Jesus was passing by, cried out, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	20	31	The crowd sternly told them to be quiet, but they cried out all the more, &ldquo;Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	20	32	And Jesus stopped and called them, and said, &ldquo;What do you want Me to do for you?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	20	33	They said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, we want our eyes to be opened.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	20	34	Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes; and immediately they regained their sight and followed Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	20	4	And to those he said, &lsquo;You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.&rsquo; And so they went.	40
NASB	Matthew	20	5	&ldquo;Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did the same thing.	40
NASB	Matthew	20	6	&ldquo;And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing around; and he said to them, &lsquo;Why have you been standing here idle all day long?&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	20	7	&ldquo;They said to him, &lsquo;Because no one hired us.&rsquo; He said to them, &lsquo;You go into the vineyard too.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	20	8	&ldquo;When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, &lsquo;Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last group to the first.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	20	9	&ldquo;When those hired about the eleventh hour came, each one received a denarius.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	1	When they had approached Jerusalem and had come to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,	40
NASB	Matthew	21	10	When He had entered Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	21	11	And the crowds were saying, &ldquo;This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth in Galilee.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	21	12	And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all those who were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	13	And He said to them, &ldquo;It is written, &lsquo;MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER&rsquo;; but you are making it a ROBBERs&rsquo; DEN.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	21	14	And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	15	But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that He had done, and the children who were shouting in the temple, &ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David,&rdquo; they became indignant	40
NASB	Matthew	21	16	And said to Him, &ldquo;Do You hear what these children are saying?&rdquo; And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Yes; have you never read, &lsquo;OUT OF THE MOUTH OF INFANTS AND NURSING BABIES YOU HAVE PREPARED PRAISE FOR YOURSELF&rsquo;?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	21	17	And He left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	18	Now in the morning, when He was returning to the city, He became hungry.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	19	Seeing a lone fig tree by the road, He came to it and found nothing on it except leaves only; and He said to it, &ldquo;No longer shall there ever be any fruit from you.&rdquo; And at once the fig tree withered.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	2	Saying to them, &ldquo;Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to Me.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	20	Seeing this, the disciples were amazed and asked, &ldquo;How did the fig tree wither all at once?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	21	21	And Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, &lsquo;Be taken up and cast into the sea,&rsquo; it will happen.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	22	&ldquo;And all things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	21	23	When He entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him while He was teaching, and said, &ldquo;By what authority are You doing these things, and who gave You this authority?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	21	24	Jesus said to them, &ldquo;I will also ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	25	&ldquo;The baptism of John was from what source, from heaven or from men?&rdquo; And they began reasoning among themselves, saying, &ldquo;If we say, &lsquo;From heaven,&rsquo; He will say to us, &lsquo;Then why did you not believe him?&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	21	26	&ldquo;But if we say, &lsquo;From men,&rsquo; we fear the people; for they all regard John as a prophet.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	21	27	And answering Jesus, they said, &ldquo;We do not know.&rdquo; He also said to them, &ldquo;Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	28	&ldquo;But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, &lsquo;Son, go work today in the vineyard.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	21	29	&ldquo;And he answered, &lsquo;I will not&rsquo;; but afterward he regretted it and went.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	3	&ldquo;If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, &lsquo;The Lord has need of them,&rsquo; and immediately he will send them.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	21	30	&ldquo;The man came to the second and said the same thing; and he answered, &lsquo;I will, sir&rsquo;; but he did not go.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	31	&ldquo;Which of the two did the will of his father?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;The first.&rdquo; Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and prostitutes will get into the kingdom of God before you.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	32	&ldquo;For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him; but the tax collectors and prostitutes did believe him; and you, seeing this, did not even feel remorse afterward so as to believe him.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	33	&ldquo;Listen to another parable. There was a landowner who PLANTED A VINEYARD AND PUT A WALL AROUND IT AND DUG A WINE PRESS IN IT, AND BUILT A TOWER, and rented it out to vine-growers and went on a journey.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	34	&ldquo;When the harvest time approached, he sent his slaves to the vine-growers to receive his produce.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	35	&ldquo;The vine-growers took his slaves and beat one, and killed another, and stoned a third.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	36	&ldquo;Again he sent another group of slaves larger than the first; and they did the same thing to them.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	37	&ldquo;But afterward he sent his son to them, saying, &lsquo;They will respect my son.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	21	38	&ldquo;But when the vine-growers saw the son, they said among themselves, &lsquo;This is the heir; come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	21	39	&ldquo;They took him, and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	4	This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet:	40
NASB	Matthew	21	40	&ldquo;Therefore when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-growers?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	21	41	They said to Him, &ldquo;He will bring those wretches to a wretched end, and will rent out the vineyard to other vine-growers who will pay him the proceeds at the proper seasons.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	21	42	Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Did you never read in the Scriptures, &lsquo;THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone; THIS CAME ABOUT FROM THE LORD, AND IT IS MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES&rsquo;?	40
NASB	Matthew	21	43	&ldquo;Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people, producing the fruit of it.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	44	&ldquo;And he who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will scatter him like dust.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	21	45	When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they understood that He was speaking about them.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	46	When they sought to seize Him, they feared the people, because they considered Him to be a prophet.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	5	&ldquo;SAY TO THE DAUGHTER OF ZION, &lsquo;BEHOLD YOUR KING IS COMING TO YOU, GENTLE, AND MOUNTED ON A DONKEY, EVEN ON A COLT, THE FOAL OF A BEAST OF BURDEN.&rsquo;&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	21	6	The disciples went and did just as Jesus had instructed them,	40
NASB	Matthew	21	7	And brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their coats on them; and He sat on the coats.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	8	Most of the crowd spread their coats in the road, and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them in the road.	40
NASB	Matthew	21	9	The crowds going ahead of Him, and those who followed, were shouting, &ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David; BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD; Hosanna in the highest!&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	22	1	Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying,	40
NASB	Matthew	22	10	&ldquo;Those slaves went out into the streets and gathered together all they found, both evil and good; and the wedding hall was filled with dinner guests.	40
NASB	Matthew	22	11	&ldquo;But when the king came in to look over the dinner guests, he saw a man there who was not dressed in wedding clothes,	40
NASB	Matthew	22	12	And he said to him, &lsquo;Friend, how did you come in here without wedding clothes?&rsquo; And the man was speechless.	40
NASB	Matthew	22	13	&ldquo;Then the king said to the servants, &lsquo;Bind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	22	14	&ldquo;For many are called, but few are chosen.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	22	15	Then the Pharisees went and plotted together how they might trap Him in what He said.	40
NASB	Matthew	22	16	And they sent their disciples to Him, along with the Herodians, saying, &ldquo;Teacher, we know that You are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and defer to no one; for You are not partial to any.	40
NASB	Matthew	22	17	&ldquo;Tell us then, what do You think? Is it lawful to give a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	22	18	But Jesus perceived their malice, and said, &ldquo;Why are you testing Me, you hypocrites?	40
NASB	Matthew	22	19	&ldquo;Show Me the coin used for the poll-tax.&rdquo; And they brought Him a denarius.	40
NASB	Matthew	22	2	&ldquo;The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son.	40
NASB	Matthew	22	20	And He said to them, &ldquo;Whose likeness and inscription is this?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	22	21	They said to Him, &ldquo;Caesar&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Then He said to them, &ldquo;Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar&rsquo;s; and to God the things that are God&rsquo;s.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	22	22	And hearing this, they were amazed, and leaving Him, they went away.	40
NASB	Matthew	22	23	On that day some Sadducees (who say there is no resurrection) came to Jesus and questioned Him,	40
NASB	Matthew	22	24	Asking, &ldquo;Teacher, Moses said, &lsquo;IF A MAN DIES HAVING NO CHILDREN, HIS BROTHER AS NEXT OF KIN SHALL MARRY HIS WIFE, AND RAISE UP CHILDREN FOR HIS BROTHER.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	22	25	&ldquo;Now there were seven brothers with us; and the first married and died, and having no children left his wife to his brother;	40
NASB	Matthew	22	26	So also the second, and the third, down to the seventh.	40
NASB	Matthew	22	27	&ldquo;Last of all, the woman died.	40
NASB	Matthew	22	28	&ldquo;In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had married her.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	22	29	But Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;You are mistaken, not understanding the Scriptures nor the power of God.	40
NASB	Matthew	22	3	&ldquo;And he sent out his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding feast, and they were unwilling to come.	40
NASB	Matthew	22	30	&ldquo;For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.	40
NASB	Matthew	22	31	&ldquo;But regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God:	40
NASB	Matthew	22	32	&lsquo;I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB&rsquo;? He is not the God of the dead but of the living.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	22	33	When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at His teaching.	40
NASB	Matthew	22	34	But when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered themselves together.	40
NASB	Matthew	22	35	One of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him,	40
NASB	Matthew	22	36	&ldquo;Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	22	37	And He said to him, &ldquo; &lsquo;YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	22	38	&ldquo;This is the great and foremost commandment.	40
NASB	Matthew	22	39	&ldquo;The second is like it, &lsquo;YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	22	4	&ldquo;Again he sent out other slaves saying, &lsquo;Tell those who have been invited, &ldquo;Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fattened livestock are all butchered and everything is ready; come to the wedding feast.&rsquo;&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	22	40	&ldquo;On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	22	41	Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question:	40
NASB	Matthew	22	42	&ldquo;What do you think about the Christ, whose son is He?&rdquo; They said to Him, &ldquo;The son of David.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	22	43	He said to them, &ldquo;Then how does David in the Spirit call Him &lsquo;Lord,&rsquo; saying,	40
NASB	Matthew	22	44	&lsquo;THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD, &ldquo;SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I PUT YOUR ENEMIES BENEATH YOUR FEET&rsquo;&rdquo;?	40
NASB	Matthew	22	45	&ldquo;If David then calls Him &lsquo;Lord,&rsquo; how is He his son?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	22	46	No one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask Him another question.	40
NASB	Matthew	22	5	&ldquo;But they paid no attention and went their way, one to his own farm, another to his business,	40
NASB	Matthew	22	6	And the rest seized his slaves and mistreated them and killed them.	40
NASB	Matthew	22	7	&ldquo;But the king was enraged, and he sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and set their city on fire.	40
NASB	Matthew	22	8	&ldquo;Then he said to his slaves, &lsquo;The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.	40
NASB	Matthew	22	9	&lsquo;Go therefore to the main highways, and as many as you find there, invite to the wedding feast.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	23	1	Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples,	40
NASB	Matthew	23	10	&ldquo;Do not be called leaders; for One is your Leader, that is, Christ.	40
NASB	Matthew	23	11	&ldquo;But the greatest among you shall be your servant.	40
NASB	Matthew	23	12	&ldquo;Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled; and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.	40
NASB	Matthew	23	13	&ldquo;But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you shut off the kingdom of heaven from people; for you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.	40
NASB	Matthew	23	14	[&ldquo;Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you devour widows&rsquo; houses, and for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore you will receive greater condemnation.]	40
NASB	Matthew	23	15	&ldquo;Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you travel around on sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves.	40
NASB	Matthew	23	16	&ldquo;Woe to you, blind guides, who say, &lsquo;Whoever swears by the temple, that is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is obligated.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	23	17	&ldquo;You fools and blind men! Which is more important, the gold or the temple that sanctified the gold?	40
NASB	Matthew	23	18	&ldquo;And, &lsquo;Whoever swears by the altar, that is nothing, but whoever swears by the offering on it, he is obligated.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	23	19	&ldquo;You blind men, which is more important, the offering, or the altar that sanctifies the offering?	40
NASB	Matthew	23	2	Saying: &ldquo;The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses;	40
NASB	Matthew	23	20	&ldquo;Therefore, whoever swears by the altar, swears both by the altar and by everything on it.	40
NASB	Matthew	23	21	&ldquo;And whoever swears by the temple, swears both by the temple and by Him who dwells within it.	40
NASB	Matthew	23	22	&ldquo;And whoever swears by heaven, swears both by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.	40
NASB	Matthew	23	23	&ldquo;Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cummin, and have neglected the weightier provisions of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness; but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others.	40
NASB	Matthew	23	24	&ldquo;You blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!	40
NASB	Matthew	23	25	&ldquo;Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of robbery and self-indulgence.	40
NASB	Matthew	23	26	&ldquo;You blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and of the dish, so that the outside of it may become clean also.	40
NASB	Matthew	23	27	&ldquo;Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside they are full of dead men&rsquo;s bones and all uncleanness.	40
NASB	Matthew	23	28	&ldquo;So you, too, outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.	40
NASB	Matthew	23	29	&ldquo;Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous,	40
NASB	Matthew	23	3	Therefore all that they tell you, do and observe, but do not do according to their deeds; for they say things and do not do them.	40
NASB	Matthew	23	30	And say, &lsquo;If we had been living in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	23	31	&ldquo;So you testify against yourselves, that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets.	40
NASB	Matthew	23	32	&ldquo;Fill up, then, the measure of the guilt of your fathers.	40
NASB	Matthew	23	33	&ldquo;You serpents, you brood of vipers, how will you escape the sentence of hell?	40
NASB	Matthew	23	34	&ldquo;Therefore, behold, I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes; some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city,	40
NASB	Matthew	23	35	So that upon you may fall the guilt of all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.	40
NASB	Matthew	23	36	&ldquo;Truly I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.	40
NASB	Matthew	23	37	&ldquo;Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were unwilling.	40
NASB	Matthew	23	38	&ldquo;Behold, your house is being left to you desolate!	40
NASB	Matthew	23	39	&ldquo;For I say to you, from now on you will not see Me until you say, &lsquo;BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD!&rsquo;&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	23	4	&ldquo;They tie up heavy burdens and lay them on men&rsquo;s shoulders, but they themselves are unwilling to move them with so much as a finger.	40
NASB	Matthew	23	5	&ldquo;But they do all their deeds to be noticed by men; for they broaden their phylacteries and lengthen the tassels of their garments.	40
NASB	Matthew	23	6	&ldquo;They love the place of honor at banquets and the chief seats in the synagogues,	40
NASB	Matthew	23	7	And respectful greetings in the market places, and being called Rabbi by men.	40
NASB	Matthew	23	8	&ldquo;But do not be called Rabbi; for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.	40
NASB	Matthew	23	9	&ldquo;Do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	1	Jesus came out from the temple and was going away when His disciples came up to point out the temple buildings to Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	10	&ldquo;At that time many will fall away and will betray one another and hate one another.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	11	&ldquo;Many false prophets will arise and will mislead many.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	12	&ldquo;Because lawlessness is increased, most people&rsquo;s love will grow cold.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	13	&ldquo;But the one who endures to the end, he will be saved.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	14	&ldquo;This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	15	&ldquo;Therefore when you see the ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),	40
NASB	Matthew	24	16	Then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	17	&ldquo;Whoever is on the housetop must not go down to get the things out that are in his house.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	18	&ldquo;Whoever is in the field must not turn back to get his cloak.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	19	&ldquo;But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days!	40
NASB	Matthew	24	2	And He said to them, &ldquo;Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, not one stone here will be left upon another, which will not be torn down.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	24	20	&ldquo;But pray that your flight will not be in the winter, or on a Sabbath.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	21	&ldquo;For then there will be a great tribulation, such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	22	&ldquo;Unless those days had been cut short, no life would have been saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	23	&ldquo;Then if anyone says to you, &lsquo;Behold, here is the Christ,&rsquo; or &lsquo;There He is,&rsquo; do not believe him.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	24	&ldquo;For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	25	&ldquo;Behold, I have told you in advance.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	26	&ldquo;So if they say to you, &lsquo;Behold, He is in the wilderness,&rsquo; do not go out, or, &lsquo;Behold, He is in the inner rooms,&rsquo; do not believe them.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	27	&ldquo;For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes even to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	28	&ldquo;Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	29	&ldquo;But immediately after the tribulation of those days THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE STARS WILL FALL from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	3	As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, &ldquo;Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	24	30	&ldquo;And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the SON OF MAN COMING ON THE CLOUDS OF THE SKY with power and great glory.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	31	&ldquo;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	32	&ldquo;Now learn the parable from the fig tree: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near;	40
NASB	Matthew	24	33	So, you too, when you see all these things, recognize that He is near, right at the door.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	34	&ldquo;Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	35	&ldquo;Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	36	&ldquo;But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	37	&ldquo;For the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the days of Noah.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	38	&ldquo;For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark,	40
NASB	Matthew	24	39	And they did not understand until the flood came and took them all away; so will the coming of the Son of Man be.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	4	And Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;See to it that no one misleads you.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	40	&ldquo;Then there will be two men in the field; one will be taken and one will be left.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	41	&ldquo;Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one will be left.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	42	&ldquo;Therefore be on the alert, for you do not know which day your Lord is coming.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	43	&ldquo;But be sure of this, that if the head of the house had known at what time of the night the thief was coming, he would have been on the alert and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	44	&ldquo;For this reason you also must be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not think He will.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	45	&ldquo;Who then is the faithful and sensible slave whom his master put in charge of his household to give them their food at the proper time?	40
NASB	Matthew	24	46	&ldquo;Blessed is that slave whom his master finds so doing when he comes.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	47	&ldquo;Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	48	&ldquo;But if that evil slave says in his heart, &lsquo;My master is not coming for a long time,&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	24	49	And begins to beat his fellow slaves and eat and drink with drunkards;	40
NASB	Matthew	24	5	&ldquo;For many will come in My name, saying, &lsquo;I am the Christ,&rsquo; and will mislead many.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	50	The master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not know,	40
NASB	Matthew	24	51	And will cut him in pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	6	&ldquo;You will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not frightened, for those things must take place, but that is not yet the end.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	7	&ldquo;For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and in various places there will be famines and earthquakes.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	8	&ldquo;But all these things are merely the beginning of birth pangs.	40
NASB	Matthew	24	9	&ldquo;Then they will deliver you to tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name.	40
NASB	Matthew	25	1	&ldquo;Then the kingdom of heaven will be comparable to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.	40
NASB	Matthew	25	10	&ldquo;And while they were going away to make the purchase, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast; and the door was shut.	40
NASB	Matthew	25	11	&ldquo;Later the other virgins also came, saying, &lsquo;Lord, lord, open up for us.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	25	12	&ldquo;But he answered, &lsquo;Truly I say to you, I do not know you.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	25	13	&ldquo;Be on the alert then, for you do not know the day nor the hour.	40
NASB	Matthew	25	14	&ldquo;For it is just like a man about to go on a journey, who called his own slaves and entrusted his possessions to them.	40
NASB	Matthew	25	15	&ldquo;To one he gave five talents, to another, two, and to another, one, each according to his own ability; and he went on his journey.	40
NASB	Matthew	25	16	&ldquo;Immediately the one who had received the five talents went and traded with them, and gained five more talents.	40
NASB	Matthew	25	17	&ldquo;In the same manner the one who had received the two talents gained two more.	40
NASB	Matthew	25	18	&ldquo;But he who received the one talent went away, and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master&rsquo;s money.	40
NASB	Matthew	25	19	&ldquo;Now after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.	40
NASB	Matthew	25	2	&ldquo;Five of them were foolish, and five were prudent.	40
NASB	Matthew	25	20	&ldquo;The one who had received the five talents came up and brought five more talents, saying, &lsquo;Master, you entrusted five talents to me. See, I have gained five more talents.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	25	21	&ldquo;His master said to him, &lsquo;Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	25	22	&ldquo;Also the one who had received the two talents came up and said, &lsquo;Master, you entrusted two talents to me. See, I have gained two more talents.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	25	23	&ldquo;His master said to him, &lsquo;Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	25	24	&ldquo;And the one also who had received the one talent came up and said, &lsquo;Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you scattered no seed.	40
NASB	Matthew	25	25	&lsquo;And I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have what is yours.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	25	26	&ldquo;But his master answered and said to him, &lsquo;You wicked, lazy slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I scattered no seed.	40
NASB	Matthew	25	27	&lsquo;Then you ought to have put my money in the bank, and on my arrival I would have received my money back with interest.	40
NASB	Matthew	25	28	&lsquo;Therefore take away the talent from him, and give it to the one who has the ten talents.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	25	29	&ldquo;For to everyone who has, more shall be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away.	40
NASB	Matthew	25	3	&ldquo;For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them,	40
NASB	Matthew	25	30	&ldquo;Throw out the worthless slave into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.	40
NASB	Matthew	25	31	&ldquo;But when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne.	40
NASB	Matthew	25	32	&ldquo;All the nations will be gathered before Him; and He will separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats;	40
NASB	Matthew	25	33	And He will put the sheep on His right, and the goats on the left.	40
NASB	Matthew	25	34	&ldquo;Then the King will say to those on His right, &lsquo;Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.	40
NASB	Matthew	25	35	&lsquo;For I was hungry, and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me something to drink; I was a stranger, and you invited Me in;	40
NASB	Matthew	25	36	Naked, and you clothed Me; I was sick, and you visited Me; I was in prison, and you came to Me.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	25	37	&ldquo;Then the righteous will answer Him, &lsquo;Lord, when did we see You hungry, and feed You, or thirsty, and give You something to drink?	40
NASB	Matthew	25	38	&lsquo;And when did we see You a stranger, and invite You in, or naked, and clothe You?	40
NASB	Matthew	25	39	&lsquo;When did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	25	4	But the prudent took oil in flasks along with their lamps.	40
NASB	Matthew	25	40	&ldquo;The King will answer and say to them, &lsquo;Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of these brothers of Mine, even the least of them, you did it to Me.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	25	41	&ldquo;Then He will also say to those on His left, &lsquo;Depart from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels;	40
NASB	Matthew	25	42	For I was hungry, and you gave Me nothing to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me nothing to drink;	40
NASB	Matthew	25	43	I was a stranger, and you did not invite Me in; naked, and you did not clothe Me; sick, and in prison, and you did not visit Me.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	25	44	&ldquo;Then they themselves also will answer, &lsquo;Lord, when did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not take care of You?&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	25	45	&ldquo;Then He will answer them, &lsquo;Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	25	46	&ldquo;These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	25	5	&ldquo;Now while the bridegroom was delaying, they all got drowsy and began to sleep.	40
NASB	Matthew	25	6	&ldquo;But at midnight there was a shout, &lsquo;Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	25	7	&ldquo;Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps.	40
NASB	Matthew	25	8	&ldquo;The foolish said to the prudent, &lsquo;Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	25	9	&ldquo;But the prudent answered, &lsquo;No, there will not be enough for us and you too; go instead to the dealers and buy some for yourselves.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	1	When Jesus had finished all these words, He said to His disciples,	40
NASB	Matthew	26	10	But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, &ldquo;Why do you bother the woman? For she has done a good deed to Me.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	11	&ldquo;For you always have the poor with you; but you do not always have Me.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	12	&ldquo;For when she poured this perfume on My body, she did it to prepare Me for burial.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	13	&ldquo;Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of in memory of her.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	14	Then one of the twelve, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests	40
NASB	Matthew	26	15	And said, &ldquo;What are you willing to give me to betray Him to you?&rdquo; And they weighed out thirty pieces of silver to him.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	16	From then on he began looking for a good opportunity to betray Jesus.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	17	Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus and asked, &ldquo;Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	18	And He said, &ldquo;Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, &lsquo;The Teacher says, &ldquo;My time is near; I am to keep the Passover at your house with My disciples.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	19	The disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	2	&ldquo;You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man is to be handed over for crucifixion.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	20	Now when evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	21	As they were eating, He said, &ldquo;Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	22	Being deeply grieved, they each one began to say to Him, &ldquo;Surely not I, Lord?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	23	And He answered, &ldquo;He who dipped his hand with Me in the bowl is the one who will betray Me.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	24	&ldquo;The Son of Man is to go, just as it is written of Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	25	And Judas, who was betraying Him, said, &ldquo;Surely it is not I, Rabbi?&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;You have said it yourself.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	26	While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and after a blessing, He broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, &ldquo;Take, eat; this is My body.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	27	And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He gave it to them, saying, &ldquo;Drink from it, all of you;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	28	For this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	29	&ldquo;But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father&rsquo;s kingdom.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	3	Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest, named Caiaphas;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	30	After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	31	Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;You will all fall away because of Me this night, for it is written, &lsquo;I WILL STRIKE DOWN THE SHEPHERD, AND THE SHEEP OF THE FLOCK SHALL BE SCATTERED.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	32	&ldquo;But after I have been raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	33	But Peter said to Him, &ldquo;Even though all may fall away because of You, I will never fall away.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	34	Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Truly I say to you that this very night, before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	35	Peter said to Him, &ldquo;Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You.&rdquo; All the disciples said the same thing too.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	36	Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to His disciples, &ldquo;Sit here while I go over there and pray.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	37	And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be grieved and distressed.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	38	Then He said to them, &ldquo;My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death; remain here and keep watch with Me.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	39	And He went a little beyond them, and fell on His face and prayed, saying, &ldquo;My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	4	And they plotted together to seize Jesus by stealth and kill Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	40	And He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, &ldquo;So, you men could not keep watch with Me for one hour?	40
NASB	Matthew	26	41	&ldquo;Keep watching and praying that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	42	He went away again a second time and prayed, saying, &ldquo;My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, Your will be done.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	43	Again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	44	And He left them again, and went away and prayed a third time, saying the same thing once more.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	45	Then He came to the disciples and said to them, &ldquo;Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	46	&ldquo;Get up, let us be going; behold, the one who betrays Me is at hand!&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	47	While He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came up accompanied by a large crowd with swords and clubs, who came from the chief priests and elders of the people.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	48	Now he who was betraying Him gave them a sign, saying, &ldquo;Whomever I kiss, He is the one; seize Him.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	49	Immediately Judas went to Jesus and said, &ldquo;Hail, Rabbi!&rdquo; and kissed Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	5	But they were saying, &ldquo;Not during the festival, otherwise a riot might occur among the people.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	50	And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Friend, do what you have come for.&rdquo; Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	51	And behold, one of those who were with Jesus reached and drew out his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	52	Then Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Put your sword back into its place; for all those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	53	&ldquo;Or do you think that I cannot appeal to My Father, and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve legions of angels?	40
NASB	Matthew	26	54	&ldquo;How then will the Scriptures be fulfilled, which say that it must happen this way?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	55	At that time Jesus said to the crowds, &ldquo;Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as you would against a robber? Every day I used to sit in the temple teaching and you did not seize Me.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	56	&ldquo;But all this has taken place to fulfill the Scriptures of the prophets.&rdquo; Then all the disciples left Him and fled.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	57	Those who had seized Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	58	But Peter was following Him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and entered in, and sat down with the officers to see the outcome.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	59	Now the chief priests and the whole Council kept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put Him to death.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	6	Now when Jesus was in Bethany, at the home of Simon the leper,	40
NASB	Matthew	26	60	They did not find any, even though many false witnesses came forward. But later on two came forward,	40
NASB	Matthew	26	61	And said, &ldquo;This man stated, &lsquo;I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.&rsquo;&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	62	The high priest stood up and said to Him, &ldquo;Do You not answer? What is it that these men are testifying against You?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	63	But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest said to Him, &ldquo;I adjure You by the living God, that You tell us whether You are the Christ, the Son of God.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	64	Jesus said to him, &ldquo;You have said it yourself; nevertheless I tell you, hereafter you will see THE SON OF MAN SITTING AT THE RIGHT HAND OF POWER, and COMING ON THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	65	Then the high priest tore his robes and said, &ldquo;He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, you have now heard the blasphemy;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	66	What do you think?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;He deserves death!&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	67	Then they spat in His face and beat Him with their fists; and others slapped Him,	40
NASB	Matthew	26	68	And said, &ldquo;Prophesy to us, You Christ; who is the one who hit You?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	69	Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant-girl came to him and said, &ldquo;You too were with Jesus the Galilean.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	7	A woman came to Him with an alabaster vial of very costly perfume, and she poured it on His head as He reclined at the table.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	70	But he denied it before them all, saying, &ldquo;I do not know what you are talking about.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	71	When he had gone out to the gateway, another servant-girl saw him and said to those who were there, &ldquo;This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	72	And again he denied it with an oath, &ldquo;I do not know the man.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	73	A little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter, &ldquo;Surely you too are one of them; for even the way you talk gives you away.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	26	74	Then he began to curse and swear, &ldquo;I do not know the man!&rdquo; And immediately a rooster crowed.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	75	And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, &ldquo;Before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.&rdquo; And he went out and wept bitterly.	40
NASB	Matthew	26	8	But the disciples were indignant when they saw this, and said, &ldquo;Why this waste?	40
NASB	Matthew	26	9	&ldquo;For this perfume might have been sold for a high price and the money given to the poor.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	1	Now when morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people conferred together against Jesus to put Him to death;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	10	AND THEY GAVE THEM FOR THE POTTER&rsquo;s FIELD, AS THE LORD DIRECTED ME.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	11	Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned Him, saying, &ldquo;Are You the King of the Jews?&rdquo; And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;It is as you say.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	12	And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He did not answer.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	13	Then Pilate said to Him, &ldquo;Do You not hear how many things they testify against You?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	14	And He did not answer him with regard to even a single charge, so the governor was quite amazed.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	15	Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the people any one prisoner whom they wanted.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	16	At that time they were holding a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	17	So when the people gathered together, Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	18	For he knew that because of envy they had handed Him over.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	19	While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, &ldquo;Have nothing to do with that righteous Man; for last night I suffered greatly in a dream because of Him.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	2	And they bound Him, and led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate the governor.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	20	But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to put Jesus to death.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	21	But the governor said to them, &ldquo;Which of the two do you want me to release for you?&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;Barabbas.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	22	Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?&rdquo; They all said, &ldquo;Crucify Him!&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	23	And he said, &ldquo;Why, what evil has He done?&rdquo; But they kept shouting all the more, saying, &ldquo;Crucify Him!&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	24	When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, &ldquo;I am innocent of this Man&rsquo;s blood; see to that yourselves.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	25	And all the people said, &ldquo;His blood shall be on us and on our children!&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	26	Then he released Barabbas for them; but after having Jesus scourged, he handed Him over to be crucified.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	27	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole Roman cohort around Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	28	They stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	29	And after twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand; and they knelt down before Him and mocked Him, saying, &ldquo;Hail, King of the Jews!&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	3	Then when Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that He had been condemned, he felt remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,	40
NASB	Matthew	27	30	They spat on Him, and took the reed and began to beat Him on the head.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	31	After they had mocked Him, they took the scarlet robe off Him and put His own garments back on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	32	As they were coming out, they found a man of Cyrene named Simon, whom they pressed into service to bear His cross.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	33	And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means Place of a Skull,	40
NASB	Matthew	27	34	They gave Him wine to drink mixed with gall; and after tasting it, He was unwilling to drink.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	35	And when they had crucified Him, they divided up His garments among themselves by casting lots.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	36	And sitting down, they began to keep watch over Him there.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	37	And above His head they put up the charge against Him which read, &ldquo;THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	38	At that time two robbers were crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	39	And those passing by were hurling abuse at Him, wagging their heads	40
NASB	Matthew	27	4	Saying, &ldquo;I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.&rdquo; But they said, &ldquo;What is that to us? See to that yourself!&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	40	And saying, &ldquo;You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	41	In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes and elders, were mocking Him and saying,	40
NASB	Matthew	27	42	&ldquo;He saved others; He cannot save Himself. He is the King of Israel; let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	43	&ldquo;HE TRUSTS IN GOD; LET GOD RESCUE Him now, IF HE DELIGHTS IN HIM; for He said, &lsquo;I am the Son of God.&rsquo;&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	44	The robbers who had been crucified with Him were also insulting Him with the same words.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	45	Now from the sixth hour darkness fell upon all the land until the ninth hour.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	46	About the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, &ldquo;ELI, ELI, LAMA SABACHTHANI?&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	47	And some of those who were standing there, when they heard it, began saying, &ldquo;This man is calling for Elijah.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	48	Immediately one of them ran, and taking a sponge, he filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	49	But the rest of them said, &ldquo;Let us see whether Elijah will come to save Him.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	5	And he threw the pieces of silver into the temple sanctuary and departed; and he went away and hanged himself.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	50	And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	51	And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth shook and the rocks were split.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	52	The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	53	And coming out of the tombs after His resurrection they entered the holy city and appeared to many.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	54	Now the centurion, and those who were with him keeping guard over Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that were happening, became very frightened and said, &ldquo;Truly this was the Son of God!&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	55	Many women were there looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee while ministering to Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	56	Among them was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	57	When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	58	This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	59	And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,	40
NASB	Matthew	27	6	The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, &ldquo;It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, since it is the price of blood.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	60	And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a large stone against the entrance of the tomb and went away.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	61	And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the grave.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	62	Now on the next day, the day after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together with Pilate,	40
NASB	Matthew	27	63	And said, &ldquo;Sir, we remember that when He was still alive that deceiver said, &lsquo;After three days I am to rise again.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	64	&ldquo;Therefore, give orders for the grave to be made secure until the third day, otherwise His disciples may come and steal Him away and say to the people, &lsquo;He has risen from the dead,&rsquo; and the last deception will be worse than the first.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	65	Pilate said to them, &ldquo;You have a guard; go, make it as secure as you know how.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	27	66	And they went and made the grave secure, and along with the guard they set a seal on the stone.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	7	And they conferred together and with the money bought the Potter&rsquo;s Field as a burial place for strangers.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	8	For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.	40
NASB	Matthew	27	9	Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: &ldquo;AND THEY TOOK THE THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER, THE PRICE OF THE ONE WHOSE PRICE HAD BEEN SET by the sons of Israel;	40
NASB	Matthew	28	1	Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the grave.	40
NASB	Matthew	28	10	Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Do not be afraid; go and take word to My brethren to leave for Galilee, and there they will see Me.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	28	11	Now while they were on their way, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.	40
NASB	Matthew	28	12	And when they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,	40
NASB	Matthew	28	13	And said, &ldquo;You are to say, &lsquo;His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	28	14	&ldquo;And if this should come to the governor&rsquo;s ears, we will win him over and keep you out of trouble.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	28	15	And they took the money and did as they had been instructed; and this story was widely spread among the Jews, and is to this day.	40
NASB	Matthew	28	16	But the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had designated.	40
NASB	Matthew	28	17	When they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some were doubtful.	40
NASB	Matthew	28	18	And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.	40
NASB	Matthew	28	19	&ldquo;Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,	40
NASB	Matthew	28	2	And behold, a severe earthquake had occurred, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it.	40
NASB	Matthew	28	20	Teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	28	3	And his appearance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow.	40
NASB	Matthew	28	4	The guards shook for fear of him and became like dead men.	40
NASB	Matthew	28	5	The angel said to the women, &ldquo;Do not be afraid; for I know that you are looking for Jesus who has been crucified.	40
NASB	Matthew	28	6	&ldquo;He is not here, for He has risen, just as He said. Come, see the place where He was lying.	40
NASB	Matthew	28	7	&ldquo;Go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead; and behold, He is going ahead of you into Galilee, there you will see Him; behold, I have told you.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	28	8	And they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy and ran to report it to His disciples.	40
NASB	Matthew	28	9	And behold, Jesus met them and greeted them. And they came up and took hold of His feet and worshiped Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	3	1	Now in those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying,	40
NASB	Matthew	3	10	&ldquo;The axe is already laid at the root of the trees; therefore every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.	40
NASB	Matthew	3	11	&ldquo;As for me, I baptize you with water for repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, and I am not fit to remove His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.	40
NASB	Matthew	3	12	&ldquo;His winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clear His threshing floor; and He will gather His wheat into the barn, but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	3	13	Then Jesus arrived from Galilee at the Jordan coming to John, to be baptized by him.	40
NASB	Matthew	3	14	But John tried to prevent Him, saying, &ldquo;I have need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	3	15	But Jesus answering said to him, &ldquo;Permit it at this time; for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.&rdquo; Then he permitted Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	3	16	After being baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and lighting on Him,	40
NASB	Matthew	3	17	And behold, a voice out of the heavens said, &ldquo;This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	3	2	&ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	3	3	For this is the one referred to by Isaiah the prophet when he said, &ldquo;THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, &lsquo;MAKE READY THE WAY OF THE LORD, MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT!&rsquo;&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	3	4	Now John himself had a garment of camel&rsquo;s hair and a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.	40
NASB	Matthew	3	5	Then Jerusalem was going out to him, and all Judea and all the district around the Jordan;	40
NASB	Matthew	3	6	And they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, as they confessed their sins.	40
NASB	Matthew	3	7	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, &ldquo;You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?	40
NASB	Matthew	3	8	&ldquo;Therefore bear fruit in keeping with repentance;	40
NASB	Matthew	3	9	And do not suppose that you can say to yourselves, &lsquo;We have Abraham for our father&rsquo;; for I say to you that from these stones God is able to raise up children to Abraham.	40
NASB	Matthew	4	1	Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.	40
NASB	Matthew	4	10	Then Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Go, Satan! For it is written, &lsquo;YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD, AND SERVE HIM ONLY.&rsquo;&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	4	11	Then the devil left Him; and behold, angels came and began to minister to Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	4	12	Now when Jesus heard that John had been taken into custody, He withdrew into Galilee;	40
NASB	Matthew	4	13	And leaving Nazareth, He came and settled in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.	40
NASB	Matthew	4	14	This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet:	40
NASB	Matthew	4	15	&ldquo;THE LAND OF ZEBULUN AND THE LAND OF NAPHTALI, BY THE WAY OF THE SEA, BEYOND THE JORDAN, GALILEE OF THE GENTILES&mdash;	40
NASB	Matthew	4	16	&ldquo;THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SITTING IN DARKNESS SAW A GREAT LIGHT, AND THOSE WHO WERE SITTING IN THE LAND AND SHADOW OF DEATH, UPON THEM A LIGHT DAWNED.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	4	17	From that time Jesus began to preach and say, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	4	18	Now as Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon who was called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.	40
NASB	Matthew	4	19	And He said to them, &ldquo;Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	4	2	And after He had fasted forty days and forty nights, He then became hungry.	40
NASB	Matthew	4	20	Immediately they left their nets and followed Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	4	21	Going on from there He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and He called them.	40
NASB	Matthew	4	22	Immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	4	23	Jesus was going throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people.	40
NASB	Matthew	4	24	The news about Him spread throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all who were ill, those suffering with various diseases and pains, demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics; and He healed them.	40
NASB	Matthew	4	25	Large crowds followed Him from Galilee and the Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and from beyond the Jordan.	40
NASB	Matthew	4	3	And the tempter came and said to Him, &ldquo;If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	4	4	But He answered and said, &ldquo;It is written, &lsquo;MAN SHALL NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF GOD.&rsquo;&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	4	5	Then the devil took Him into the holy city and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple,	40
NASB	Matthew	4	6	And said to Him, &ldquo;If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down; for it is written, &lsquo;HE WILL COMMAND HIS ANGELS CONCERNING YOU&rsquo;; and &lsquo;ON their HANDS THEY WILL BEAR YOU UP, SO THAT YOU WILL NOT STRIKE YOUR FOOT AGAINST A STONE.&rsquo;&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	4	7	Jesus said to him, &ldquo;On the other hand, it is written, &lsquo;YOU SHALL NOT PUT THE LORD YOUR GOD TO THE TEST.&rsquo;&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	4	8	Again, the devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory;	40
NASB	Matthew	4	9	And he said to Him, &ldquo;All these things I will give You, if You fall down and worship me.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	5	1	When Jesus saw the crowds, He went up on the mountain; and after He sat down, His disciples came to Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	10	&ldquo;Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	11	&ldquo;Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	12	&ldquo;Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great; for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	13	&ldquo;You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has become tasteless, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	14	&ldquo;You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden;	40
NASB	Matthew	5	15	Nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	16	&ldquo;Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	17	&ldquo;Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	18	&ldquo;For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	19	&ldquo;Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	2	He opened His mouth and began to teach them, saying,	40
NASB	Matthew	5	20	&ldquo;For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	21	&ldquo;You have heard that the ancients were told, &lsquo;YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT MURDER&rsquo; and &lsquo;Whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	5	22	&ldquo;But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court; and whoever says to his brother, &lsquo;You good-for-nothing,&rsquo; shall be guilty before the supreme court; and whoever says, &lsquo;You fool,&rsquo; shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	23	&ldquo;Therefore if you are presenting your offering at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,	40
NASB	Matthew	5	24	Leave your offering there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and present your offering.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	25	&ldquo;Make friends quickly with your opponent at law while you are with him on the way, so that your opponent may not hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	26	&ldquo;Truly I say to you, you will not come out of there until you have paid up the last cent.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	27	&ldquo;You have heard that it was said, &lsquo;YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY&rsquo;;	40
NASB	Matthew	5	28	But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	29	&ldquo;If your right eye makes you stumble, tear it out and throw it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	3	&ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	30	&ldquo;If your right hand makes you stumble, cut it off and throw it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body, than for your whole body to go into hell.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	31	&ldquo;It was said, &lsquo;WHOEVER SENDS HIS WIFE AWAY, LET HIM GIVE HER A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE&rsquo;;	40
NASB	Matthew	5	32	But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for the reason of unchastity, makes her commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	33	&ldquo;Again, you have heard that the ancients were told, &lsquo;YOU SHALL NOT MAKE FALSE VOWS, BUT SHALL FULFILL YOUR VOWS TO THE LORD.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	5	34	&ldquo;But I say to you, make no oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God,	40
NASB	Matthew	5	35	Or by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet, or by Jerusalem, for it is THE CITY OF THE GREAT KING.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	36	&ldquo;Nor shall you make an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	37	&ldquo;But let your statement be, &lsquo;Yes, yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;No, no&rsquo;; anything beyond these is of evil.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	38	&ldquo;You have heard that it was said, &lsquo;AN EYE FOR AN EYE, AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	5	39	&ldquo;But I say to you, do not resist an evil person; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	4	&ldquo;Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	40	&ldquo;If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your coat also.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	41	&ldquo;Whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him two.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	42	&ldquo;Give to him who asks of you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	43	&ldquo;You have heard that it was said, &lsquo;YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR and hate your enemy.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	5	44	&ldquo;But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,	40
NASB	Matthew	5	45	So that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	46	&ldquo;For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?	40
NASB	Matthew	5	47	&ldquo;If you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?	40
NASB	Matthew	5	48	&ldquo;Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	5	&ldquo;Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	6	&ldquo;Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	7	&ldquo;Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	8	&ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.	40
NASB	Matthew	5	9	&ldquo;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.	40
NASB	Matthew	6	1	&ldquo;Beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.	40
NASB	Matthew	6	10	&lsquo;Your kingdom come. Your will be done, On earth as it is in heaven.	40
NASB	Matthew	6	11	&lsquo;Give us this day our daily bread.	40
NASB	Matthew	6	12	&lsquo;And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.	40
NASB	Matthew	6	13	&lsquo;And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil. [For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.&rsquo;]	40
NASB	Matthew	6	14	&ldquo;For if you forgive others for their transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.	40
NASB	Matthew	6	15	&ldquo;But if you do not forgive others, then your Father will not forgive your transgressions.	40
NASB	Matthew	6	16	&ldquo;Whenever you fast, do not put on a gloomy face as the hypocrites do, for they neglect their appearance so that they will be noticed by men when they are fasting. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.	40
NASB	Matthew	6	17	&ldquo;But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face	40
NASB	Matthew	6	18	So that your fasting will not be noticed by men, but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.	40
NASB	Matthew	6	19	&ldquo;Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.	40
NASB	Matthew	6	2	&ldquo;So when you give to the poor, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be honored by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.	40
NASB	Matthew	6	20	&ldquo;But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal;	40
NASB	Matthew	6	21	For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.	40
NASB	Matthew	6	22	&ldquo;The eye is the lamp of the body; so then if your eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light.	40
NASB	Matthew	6	23	&ldquo;But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!	40
NASB	Matthew	6	24	&ldquo;No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.	40
NASB	Matthew	6	25	&ldquo;For this reason I say to you, do not be worried about your life, as to what you will eat or what you will drink; nor for your body, as to what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?	40
NASB	Matthew	6	26	&ldquo;Look at the birds of the air, that they do not sow, nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth much more than they?	40
NASB	Matthew	6	27	&ldquo;And who of you by being worried can add a single hour to his life?	40
NASB	Matthew	6	28	&ldquo;And why are you worried about clothing? Observe how the lilies of the field grow; they do not toil nor do they spin,	40
NASB	Matthew	6	29	Yet I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these.	40
NASB	Matthew	6	3	&ldquo;But when you give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,	40
NASB	Matthew	6	30	&ldquo;But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you? You of little faith!	40
NASB	Matthew	6	31	&ldquo;Do not worry then, saying, &lsquo;What will we eat?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What will we drink?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What will we wear for clothing?&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	6	32	&ldquo;For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.	40
NASB	Matthew	6	33	&ldquo;But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.	40
NASB	Matthew	6	34	&ldquo;So do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will care for itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.	40
NASB	Matthew	6	4	So that your giving will be in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.	40
NASB	Matthew	6	5	&ldquo;When you pray, you are not to be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners so that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.	40
NASB	Matthew	6	6	&ldquo;But you, when you pray, go into your inner room, close your door and pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.	40
NASB	Matthew	6	7	&ldquo;And when you are praying, do not use meaningless repetition as the Gentiles do, for they suppose that they will be heard for their many words.	40
NASB	Matthew	6	8	&ldquo;So do not be like them; for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	6	9	&ldquo;Pray, then, in this way: &lsquo;Our Father who is in heaven, Hallowed be Your name.	40
NASB	Matthew	7	1	&ldquo;Do not judge so that you will not be judged.	40
NASB	Matthew	7	10	&ldquo;Or if he asks for a fish, he will not give him a snake, will he?	40
NASB	Matthew	7	11	&ldquo;If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give what is good to those who ask Him!	40
NASB	Matthew	7	12	&ldquo;In everything, therefore, treat people the same way you want them to treat you, for this is the Law and the Prophets.	40
NASB	Matthew	7	13	&ldquo;Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it.	40
NASB	Matthew	7	14	&ldquo;For the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life, and there are few who find it.	40
NASB	Matthew	7	15	&ldquo;Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.	40
NASB	Matthew	7	16	&ldquo;You will know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs from thistles, are they?	40
NASB	Matthew	7	17	&ldquo;So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.	40
NASB	Matthew	7	18	&ldquo;A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.	40
NASB	Matthew	7	19	&ldquo;Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.	40
NASB	Matthew	7	2	&ldquo;For in the way you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you.	40
NASB	Matthew	7	20	&ldquo;So then, you will know them by their fruits.	40
NASB	Matthew	7	21	&ldquo;Not everyone who says to Me, &lsquo;Lord, Lord,&rsquo; will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter.	40
NASB	Matthew	7	22	&ldquo;Many will say to Me on that day, &lsquo;Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	7	23	&ldquo;And then I will declare to them, &lsquo;I never knew you; DEPART FROM ME, YOU WHO PRACTICE LAWLESSNESS.&rsquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	7	24	&ldquo;Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them, may be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock.	40
NASB	Matthew	7	25	&ldquo;And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock.	40
NASB	Matthew	7	26	&ldquo;Everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.	40
NASB	Matthew	7	27	&ldquo;The rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell&mdash;and great was its fall.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	7	28	When Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were amazed at His teaching;	40
NASB	Matthew	7	29	For He was teaching them as one having authority, and not as their scribes.	40
NASB	Matthew	7	3	&ldquo;Why do you look at the speck that is in your brother&rsquo;s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?	40
NASB	Matthew	7	4	&ldquo;Or how can you say to your brother, &lsquo;Let me take the speck out of your eye,&rsquo; and behold, the log is in your own eye?	40
NASB	Matthew	7	5	&ldquo;You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother&rsquo;s eye.	40
NASB	Matthew	7	6	&ldquo;Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine, or they will trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.	40
NASB	Matthew	7	7	&ldquo;Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.	40
NASB	Matthew	7	8	&ldquo;For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.	40
NASB	Matthew	7	9	&ldquo;Or what man is there among you who, when his son asks for a loaf, will give him a stone?	40
NASB	Matthew	8	1	When Jesus came down from the mountain, large crowds followed Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	8	10	Now when Jesus heard this, He marveled and said to those who were following, &ldquo;Truly I say to you, I have not found such great faith with anyone in Israel.	40
NASB	Matthew	8	11	&ldquo;I say to you that many will come from east and west, and recline at the table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven;	40
NASB	Matthew	8	12	But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	8	13	And Jesus said to the centurion, &ldquo;Go; it shall be done for you as you have believed.&rdquo; And the servant was healed that very moment.	40
NASB	Matthew	8	14	When Jesus came into Peter&rsquo;s home, He saw his mother-in-law lying sick in bed with a fever.	40
NASB	Matthew	8	15	He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she got up and waited on Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	8	16	When evening came, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed; and He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were ill.	40
NASB	Matthew	8	17	This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet: &ldquo;HE HIMSELF TOOK OUR INFIRMITIES AND CARRIED AWAY OUR DISEASES.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	8	18	Now when Jesus saw a crowd around Him, He gave orders to depart to the other side of the sea.	40
NASB	Matthew	8	19	Then a scribe came and said to Him, &ldquo;Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	8	2	And a leper came to Him and bowed down before Him, and said, &ldquo;Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	8	20	Jesus said to him, &ldquo;The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	8	21	Another of the disciples said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	8	22	But Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Follow Me, and allow the dead to bury their own dead.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	8	23	When He got into the boat, His disciples followed Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	8	24	And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being covered with the waves; but Jesus Himself was asleep.	40
NASB	Matthew	8	25	And they came to Him and woke Him, saying, &ldquo;Save us, Lord; we are perishing!&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	8	26	He said to them, &ldquo;Why are you afraid, you men of little faith?&rdquo; Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it became perfectly calm.	40
NASB	Matthew	8	27	The men were amazed, and said, &ldquo;What kind of a man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	8	28	When He came to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes, two men who were demon-possessed met Him as they were coming out of the tombs. They were so extremely violent that no one could pass by that way.	40
NASB	Matthew	8	29	And they cried out, saying, &ldquo;What business do we have with each other, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	8	3	Jesus stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, &ldquo;I am willing; be cleansed.&rdquo; And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.	40
NASB	Matthew	8	30	Now there was a herd of many swine feeding at a distance from them.	40
NASB	Matthew	8	31	The demons began to entreat Him, saying, &ldquo;If You are going to cast us out, send us into the herd of swine.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	8	32	And He said to them, &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; And they came out and went into the swine, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the waters.	40
NASB	Matthew	8	33	The herdsmen ran away, and went to the city and reported everything, including what had happened to the demoniacs.	40
NASB	Matthew	8	34	And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they implored Him to leave their region.	40
NASB	Matthew	8	4	And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest and present the offering that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	8	5	And when Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, imploring Him,	40
NASB	Matthew	8	6	And saying, &ldquo;Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, fearfully tormented.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	8	7	Jesus said to him, &ldquo;I will come and heal him.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	8	8	But the centurion said, &ldquo;Lord, I am not worthy for You to come under my roof, but just say the word, and my servant will be healed.	40
NASB	Matthew	8	9	&ldquo;For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to this one, &lsquo;Go!&rsquo; and he goes, and to another, &lsquo;Come!&rsquo; and he comes, and to my slave, &lsquo;Do this!&rsquo; and he does it.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	9	1	Getting into a boat, Jesus crossed over the sea and came to His own city.	40
NASB	Matthew	9	10	Then it happened that as Jesus was reclining at the table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were dining with Jesus and His disciples.	40
NASB	Matthew	9	11	When the Pharisees saw this, they said to His disciples, &ldquo;Why is your Teacher eating with the tax collectors and sinners?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	9	12	But when Jesus heard this, He said, &ldquo;It is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick.	40
NASB	Matthew	9	13	&ldquo;But go and learn what this means: &lsquo;I DESIRE COMPASSION, AND NOT SACRIFICE,&rsquo; for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	9	14	Then the disciples of John came to Him, asking, &ldquo;Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	9	15	And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;The attendants of the bridegroom cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, can they? But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.	40
NASB	Matthew	9	16	&ldquo;But no one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear results.	40
NASB	Matthew	9	17	&ldquo;Nor do people put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out and the wineskins are ruined; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	9	18	While He was saying these things to them, a synagogue official came and bowed down before Him, and said, &ldquo;My daughter has just died; but come and lay Your hand on her, and she will live.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	9	19	Jesus got up and began to follow him, and so did His disciples.	40
NASB	Matthew	9	2	And they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, &ldquo;Take courage, son; your sins are forgiven.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	9	20	And a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years, came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His cloak;	40
NASB	Matthew	9	21	For she was saying to herself, &ldquo;If I only touch His garment, I will get well.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	9	22	But Jesus turning and seeing her said, &ldquo;Daughter, take courage; your faith has made you well.&rdquo; At once the woman was made well.	40
NASB	Matthew	9	23	When Jesus came into the official&rsquo;s house, and saw the flute-players and the crowd in noisy disorder,	40
NASB	Matthew	9	24	He said, &ldquo;Leave; for the girl has not died, but is asleep.&rdquo; And they began laughing at Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	9	25	But when the crowd had been sent out, He entered and took her by the hand, and the girl got up.	40
NASB	Matthew	9	26	This news spread throughout all that land.	40
NASB	Matthew	9	27	As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out, &ldquo;Have mercy on us, Son of David!&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	9	28	When He entered the house, the blind men came up to Him, and Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Do you believe that I am able to do this?&rdquo; They said to Him, &ldquo;Yes, Lord.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	9	29	Then He touched their eyes, saying, &ldquo;It shall be done to you according to your faith.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	9	3	And some of the scribes said to themselves, &ldquo;This fellow blasphemes.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	9	30	And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them: &ldquo;See that no one knows about this!&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	9	31	But they went out and spread the news about Him throughout all that land.	40
NASB	Matthew	9	32	As they were going out, a mute, demon-possessed man was brought to Him.	40
NASB	Matthew	9	33	After the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke; and the crowds were amazed, and were saying, &ldquo;Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	9	34	But the Pharisees were saying, &ldquo;He casts out the demons by the ruler of the demons.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	9	35	Jesus was going through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.	40
NASB	Matthew	9	36	Seeing the people, He felt compassion for them, because they were distressed and dispirited like sheep without a shepherd.	40
NASB	Matthew	9	37	Then He said to His disciples, &ldquo;The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.	40
NASB	Matthew	9	38	&ldquo;Therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	9	4	And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, &ldquo;Why are you thinking evil in your hearts?	40
NASB	Matthew	9	5	&ldquo;Which is easier, to say, &lsquo;Your sins are forgiven,&rsquo; or to say, &lsquo;Get up, and walk&rsquo;?	40
NASB	Matthew	9	6	&ldquo;But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins&rdquo;&mdash;then He said to the paralytic, &ldquo;Get up, pick up your bed and go home.&rdquo;	40
NASB	Matthew	9	7	And he got up and went home.	40
NASB	Matthew	9	8	But when the crowds saw this, they were awestruck, and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.	40
NASB	Matthew	9	9	As Jesus went on from there, He saw a man called Matthew, sitting in the tax collector&rsquo;s booth; and He said to him, &ldquo;Follow Me!&rdquo; And he got up and followed Him.	40
NASB	Philemon	1	1	Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved brother and fellow worker,	57
NASB	Philemon	1	10	I appeal to you for my child Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my imprisonment,	57
NASB	Philemon	1	11	Who formerly was useless to you, but now is useful both to you and to me.	57
NASB	Philemon	1	12	I have sent him back to you in person, that is, sending my very heart,	57
NASB	Philemon	1	13	Whom I wished to keep with me, so that on your behalf he might minister to me in my imprisonment for the gospel;	57
NASB	Philemon	1	14	But without your consent I did not want to do anything, so that your goodness would not be, in effect, by compulsion but of your own free will.	57
NASB	Philemon	1	15	For perhaps he was for this reason separated from you for a while, that you would have him back forever,	57
NASB	Philemon	1	16	No longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.	57
NASB	Philemon	1	17	If then you regard me a partner, accept him as you would me.	57
NASB	Philemon	1	18	But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge that to my account;	57
NASB	Philemon	1	19	I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand, I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self as well).	57
NASB	Philemon	1	2	And to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:	57
NASB	Philemon	1	20	Yes, brother, let me benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.	57
NASB	Philemon	1	21	Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, since I know that you will do even more than what I say.	57
NASB	Philemon	1	22	At the same time also prepare me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given to you.	57
NASB	Philemon	1	23	Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,	57
NASB	Philemon	1	24	As do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow workers.	57
NASB	Philemon	1	25	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.	57
NASB	Philemon	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	57
NASB	Philemon	1	4	I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,	57
NASB	Philemon	1	5	Because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints;	57
NASB	Philemon	1	6	And I pray that the fellowship of your faith may become effective through the knowledge of every good thing which is in you for Christ&rsquo;s sake.	57
NASB	Philemon	1	7	For I have come to have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.	57
NASB	Philemon	1	8	Therefore, though I have enough confidence in Christ to order you to do what is proper,	57
NASB	Philemon	1	9	Yet for love&rsquo;s sake I rather appeal to you&mdash;since I am such a person as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus&mdash;	57
NASB	Philippians	1	1	Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons:	50
NASB	Philippians	1	10	So that you may approve the things that are excellent, in order to be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ;	50
NASB	Philippians	1	11	Having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.	50
NASB	Philippians	1	12	Now I want you to know, brethren, that my circumstances have turned out for the greater progress of the gospel,	50
NASB	Philippians	1	13	So that my imprisonment in the cause of Christ has become well known throughout the whole praetorian guard and to everyone else,	50
NASB	Philippians	1	14	And that most of the brethren, trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment, have far more courage to speak the word of God without fear.	50
NASB	Philippians	1	15	Some, to be sure, are preaching Christ even from envy and strife, but some also from good will;	50
NASB	Philippians	1	16	The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel;	50
NASB	Philippians	1	17	The former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition rather than from pure motives, thinking to cause me distress in my imprisonment.	50
NASB	Philippians	1	18	What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice,	50
NASB	Philippians	1	19	For I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,	50
NASB	Philippians	1	2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	50
NASB	Philippians	1	20	According to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will not be put to shame in anything, but that with all boldness, Christ will even now, as always, be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.	50
NASB	Philippians	1	21	For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.	50
NASB	Philippians	1	22	But if I am to live on in the flesh, this will mean fruitful labor for me; and I do not know which to choose.	50
NASB	Philippians	1	23	But I am hard-pressed from both directions, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for that is very much better;	50
NASB	Philippians	1	24	Yet to remain on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.	50
NASB	Philippians	1	25	Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith,	50
NASB	Philippians	1	26	So that your proud confidence in me may abound in Christ Jesus through my coming to you again.	50
NASB	Philippians	1	27	Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or remain absent, I will hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;	50
NASB	Philippians	1	28	In no way alarmed by your opponents&mdash;which is a sign of destruction for them, but of salvation for you, and that too, from God.	50
NASB	Philippians	1	29	For to you it has been granted for Christ&rsquo;s sake, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake,	50
NASB	Philippians	1	3	I thank my God in all my remembrance of you,	50
NASB	Philippians	1	30	Experiencing the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.	50
NASB	Philippians	1	4	Always offering prayer with joy in my every prayer for you all,	50
NASB	Philippians	1	5	In view of your participation in the gospel from the first day until now.	50
NASB	Philippians	1	6	For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.	50
NASB	Philippians	1	7	For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of grace with me.	50
NASB	Philippians	1	8	For God is my witness, how I long for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus.	50
NASB	Philippians	1	9	And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment,	50
NASB	Philippians	2	1	Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion,	50
NASB	Philippians	2	10	So that at the name of Jesus EVERY KNEE WILL BOW, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth,	50
NASB	Philippians	2	11	And that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.	50
NASB	Philippians	2	12	So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling;	50
NASB	Philippians	2	13	For it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure.	50
NASB	Philippians	2	14	Do all things without grumbling or disputing;	50
NASB	Philippians	2	15	So that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world,	50
NASB	Philippians	2	16	Holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain.	50
NASB	Philippians	2	17	But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all.	50
NASB	Philippians	2	18	You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me.	50
NASB	Philippians	2	19	But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition.	50
NASB	Philippians	2	2	Make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose.	50
NASB	Philippians	2	20	For I have no one else of kindred spirit who will genuinely be concerned for your welfare.	50
NASB	Philippians	2	21	For they all seek after their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus.	50
NASB	Philippians	2	22	But you know of his proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.	50
NASB	Philippians	2	23	Therefore I hope to send him immediately, as soon as I see how things go with me;	50
NASB	Philippians	2	24	And I trust in the Lord that I myself also will be coming shortly.	50
NASB	Philippians	2	25	But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need;	50
NASB	Philippians	2	26	Because he was longing for you all and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick.	50
NASB	Philippians	2	27	For indeed he was sick to the point of death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow.	50
NASB	Philippians	2	28	Therefore I have sent him all the more eagerly so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may be less concerned about you.	50
NASB	Philippians	2	29	Receive him then in the Lord with all joy, and hold men like him in high regard;	50
NASB	Philippians	2	3	Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves;	50
NASB	Philippians	2	30	Because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was deficient in your service to me.	50
NASB	Philippians	2	4	Do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others.	50
NASB	Philippians	2	5	Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus,	50
NASB	Philippians	2	6	Who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped,	50
NASB	Philippians	2	7	But emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men.	50
NASB	Philippians	2	8	Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.	50
NASB	Philippians	2	9	For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name,	50
NASB	Philippians	3	1	Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things again is no trouble to me, and it is a safeguard for you.	50
NASB	Philippians	3	10	That I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death;	50
NASB	Philippians	3	11	In order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.	50
NASB	Philippians	3	12	Not that I have already obtained it or have already become perfect, but I press on so that I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.	50
NASB	Philippians	3	13	Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead,	50
NASB	Philippians	3	14	I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.	50
NASB	Philippians	3	15	Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, have this attitude; and if in anything you have a different attitude, God will reveal that also to you;	50
NASB	Philippians	3	16	However, let us keep living by that same  standard to which we have attained.	50
NASB	Philippians	3	17	Brethren, join in following my example, and observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us.	50
NASB	Philippians	3	18	For many walk, of whom I often told you, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ,	50
NASB	Philippians	3	19	Whose end is destruction, whose god is their appetite, and whose glory is in their shame, who set their minds on earthly things.	50
NASB	Philippians	3	2	Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the false circumcision;	50
NASB	Philippians	3	20	For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ;	50
NASB	Philippians	3	21	Who will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has even to subject all things to Himself.	50
NASB	Philippians	3	3	For we are the true circumcision, who worship in the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh,	50
NASB	Philippians	3	4	Although I myself might have confidence even in the flesh. If anyone else has a mind to put confidence in the flesh, I far more:	50
NASB	Philippians	3	5	Circumcised the eighth day, of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the Law, a Pharisee;	50
NASB	Philippians	3	6	As to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to the righteousness which is in the Law, found blameless.	50
NASB	Philippians	3	7	But whatever things were gain to me, those things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ.	50
NASB	Philippians	3	8	More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ,	50
NASB	Philippians	3	9	And may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith,	50
NASB	Philippians	4	1	Therefore, my beloved brethren whom I long to see, my joy and crown, in this way stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.	50
NASB	Philippians	4	10	But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at last you have revived your concern for me; indeed, you were concerned before, but you lacked opportunity.	50
NASB	Philippians	4	11	Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am.	50
NASB	Philippians	4	12	I know how to get along with humble means, and I also know how to live in prosperity; in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance and suffering need.	50
NASB	Philippians	4	13	I can do all things through Him who strengthens me.	50
NASB	Philippians	4	14	Nevertheless, you have done well to share with me in my affliction.	50
NASB	Philippians	4	15	You yourselves also know, Philippians, that at the first preaching of the gospel, after I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you alone;	50
NASB	Philippians	4	16	For even in Thessalonica you sent a gift more than once for my needs.	50
NASB	Philippians	4	17	Not that I seek the gift itself, but I seek for the profit which increases to your account.	50
NASB	Philippians	4	18	But I have received everything in full and have an abundance; I am amply supplied, having received from Epaphroditus what you have sent, a fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.	50
NASB	Philippians	4	19	And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.	50
NASB	Philippians	4	2	I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to live in harmony in the Lord.	50
NASB	Philippians	4	20	Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever. Amen.	50
NASB	Philippians	4	21	Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you.	50
NASB	Philippians	4	22	All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar&rsquo;s household.	50
NASB	Philippians	4	23	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.	50
NASB	Philippians	4	3	Indeed, true companion, I ask you also to help these women who have shared my struggle in the cause of the gospel, together with Clement also and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.	50
NASB	Philippians	4	4	Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice!	50
NASB	Philippians	4	5	Let your gentle spirit be known to all men. The Lord is near.	50
NASB	Philippians	4	6	Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.	50
NASB	Philippians	4	7	And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.	50
NASB	Philippians	4	8	Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things.	50
NASB	Philippians	4	9	The things you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.	50
NASB	Revelation	1	1	After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven, and the first voice which I had heard, like the sound of a trumpet speaking with me, said, &ldquo;Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	1	1	The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show to His bond-servants, the things which must soon take place; and He sent and communicated it by His angel to His bond-servant John,	66
NASB	Revelation	1	10	I was in the Spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like the sound of a trumpet,	66
NASB	Revelation	1	10	The twenty-four elders will fall down before Him who sits on the throne, and will worship Him who lives forever and ever, and will cast their crowns before the throne, saying,	66
NASB	Revelation	1	11	&ldquo;Worthy are You, our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and because of Your will they existed, and were created.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	1	11	Saying, &ldquo;Write in a book what you see, and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	1	12	Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands;	66
NASB	Revelation	1	13	And in the middle of the lampstands I saw one like a son of man, clothed in a robe reaching to the feet, and girded across His chest with a golden sash.	66
NASB	Revelation	1	14	His head and His hair were white like white wool, like snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire.	66
NASB	Revelation	1	15	His feet were like burnished bronze, when it has been made to glow in a furnace, and His voice was like the sound of many waters.	66
NASB	Revelation	1	16	In His right hand He held seven stars, and out of His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword; and His face was like the sun shining in its strength.	66
NASB	Revelation	1	17	When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man. And He placed His right hand on me, saying, &ldquo;Do not be afraid; I am the first and the last,	66
NASB	Revelation	1	18	And the living One; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.	66
NASB	Revelation	1	19	&ldquo;Therefore write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will take place after these things.	66
NASB	Revelation	1	2	Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne was standing in heaven, and One sitting on the throne.	66
NASB	Revelation	1	2	Who testified to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw.	66
NASB	Revelation	1	20	&ldquo;As for the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.	66
NASB	Revelation	1	3	And He who was sitting was like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance; and there was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald in appearance.	66
NASB	Revelation	1	3	Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near.	66
NASB	Revelation	1	4	Around the throne were twenty-four thrones; and upon the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white garments, and golden crowns on their heads.	66
NASB	Revelation	1	4	John to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace, from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne,	66
NASB	Revelation	1	5	And from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and released us from our sins by His blood&mdash;	66
NASB	Revelation	1	5	Out from the throne come flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God;	66
NASB	Revelation	1	6	And He has made us to be a kingdom, priests to His God and Father&mdash;to Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.	66
NASB	Revelation	1	6	And before the throne there was something like a sea of glass, like crystal; and in the center and around the throne, four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind.	66
NASB	Revelation	1	7	BEHOLD, HE IS COMING WITH THE CLOUDS, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn over Him. So it is to be. Amen.	66
NASB	Revelation	1	7	The first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face like that of a man, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle.	66
NASB	Revelation	1	8	&ldquo;I am the Alpha and the Omega,&rdquo; says the Lord God, &ldquo;who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	1	8	And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within; and day and night they do not cease to say, &ldquo;HOLY, HOLY, HOLY is THE LORD GOD, THE ALMIGHTY, WHO WAS AND WHO IS AND WHO IS TO COME.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	1	9	And when the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever,	66
NASB	Revelation	1	9	I, John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance which are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.	66
NASB	Revelation	10	1	I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire;	66
NASB	Revelation	10	10	I took the little book out of the angel&rsquo;s hand and ate it, and in my mouth it was sweet as honey; and when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.	66
NASB	Revelation	10	11	And they said to me, &ldquo;You must prophesy again concerning many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	10	2	And he had in his hand a little book which was open. He placed his right foot on the sea and his left on the land;	66
NASB	Revelation	10	3	And he cried out with a loud voice, as when a lion roars; and when he had cried out, the seven peals of thunder uttered their voices.	66
NASB	Revelation	10	4	When the seven peals of thunder had spoken, I was about to write; and I heard a voice from heaven saying, &ldquo;Seal up the things which the seven peals of thunder have spoken and do not write them.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	10	5	Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to heaven,	66
NASB	Revelation	10	6	And swore by Him who lives forever and ever, WHO CREATED HEAVEN AND THE THINGS IN IT, AND THE EARTH AND THE THINGS IN IT, AND THE SEA AND THE THINGS IN IT, that there will be delay no longer,	66
NASB	Revelation	10	7	But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished, as He preached to His servants the prophets.	66
NASB	Revelation	10	8	Then the voice which I heard from heaven, I heard again speaking with me, and saying, &ldquo;Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	10	9	So I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book. And he said to me, &ldquo;Take it and eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	11	1	Then there was given me a measuring rod like a staff; and someone said, &ldquo;Get up and measure the temple of God and the altar, and those who worship in it.	66
NASB	Revelation	11	10	And those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and celebrate; and they will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.	66
NASB	Revelation	11	11	But after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God came into them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear fell upon those who were watching them.	66
NASB	Revelation	11	12	And they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, &ldquo;Come up here.&rdquo; Then they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies watched them.	66
NASB	Revelation	11	13	And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell; seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.	66
NASB	Revelation	11	14	The second woe is past; behold, the third woe is coming quickly.	66
NASB	Revelation	11	15	Then the seventh angel sounded; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, &ldquo;The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ; and He will reign forever and ever.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	11	16	And the twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God,	66
NASB	Revelation	11	17	Saying, &ldquo;We give You thanks, O Lord God, the Almighty, who are and who were, because You have taken Your great power and have begun to reign.	66
NASB	Revelation	11	18	&ldquo;And the nations were enraged, and Your wrath came, and the time came for the dead to be judged, and the time to reward Your bond-servants the prophets and the saints and those who fear Your name, the small and the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	11	19	And the temple of God which is in heaven was opened; and the ark of His covenant appeared in His temple, and there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder and an earthquake and a great hailstorm.	66
NASB	Revelation	11	2	&ldquo;Leave out the court which is outside the temple and do not measure it, for it has been given to the nations; and they will tread under foot the holy city for forty-two months.	66
NASB	Revelation	11	3	&ldquo;And I will grant authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for twelve hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	11	4	These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.	66
NASB	Revelation	11	5	And if anyone wants to harm them, fire flows out of their mouth and devours their enemies; so if anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this way.	66
NASB	Revelation	11	6	These have the power to shut up the sky, so that rain will not fall during the days of their prophesying; and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.	66
NASB	Revelation	11	7	When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them and kill them.	66
NASB	Revelation	11	8	And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city which mystically is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.	66
NASB	Revelation	11	9	Those from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days, and will not permit their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb.	66
NASB	Revelation	12	1	A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars;	66
NASB	Revelation	12	10	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, &ldquo;Now the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down, he who accuses them before our God day and night.	66
NASB	Revelation	12	11	&ldquo;And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life even when faced with death.	66
NASB	Revelation	12	12	&ldquo;For this reason, rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has only a short time.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	12	13	And when the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child.	66
NASB	Revelation	12	14	But the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, so that she could fly into the wilderness to her place, where she was nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent.	66
NASB	Revelation	12	15	And the serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, so that he might cause her to be swept away with the flood.	66
NASB	Revelation	12	16	But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and drank up the river which the dragon poured out of his mouth.	66
NASB	Revelation	12	17	So the dragon was enraged with the woman, and went off to make war with the rest of her children, who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus.	66
NASB	Revelation	12	2	And she was with child; and she cried out, being in labor and in pain to give birth.	66
NASB	Revelation	12	3	Then another sign appeared in heaven: and behold, a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads were seven diadems.	66
NASB	Revelation	12	4	And his tail swept away a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child.	66
NASB	Revelation	12	5	And she gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne.	66
NASB	Revelation	12	6	Then the woman fled into the wilderness where she had a place prepared by God, so that there she would be nourished for one thousand two hundred and sixty days.	66
NASB	Revelation	12	7	And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels waging war with the dragon. The dragon and his angels waged war,	66
NASB	Revelation	12	8	And they were not strong enough, and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven.	66
NASB	Revelation	12	9	And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.	66
NASB	Revelation	13	1	And the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore. Then I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns were ten diadems, and on his heads were blasphemous names.	66
NASB	Revelation	13	10	If anyone is destined for captivity, to captivity he goes; if anyone kills with the sword, with the sword he must be killed. Here is the perseverance and the faith of the saints.	66
NASB	Revelation	13	11	Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon.	66
NASB	Revelation	13	12	He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence. And he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed.	66
NASB	Revelation	13	13	He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth in the presence of men.	66
NASB	Revelation	13	14	And he deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which it was given him to perform in the presence of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who had the wound of the sword and has come to life.	66
NASB	Revelation	13	15	And it was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast would even speak and cause as many as do not worship the image of the beast to be killed.	66
NASB	Revelation	13	16	And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free men and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead,	66
NASB	Revelation	13	17	And he provides that no one will be able to buy or to sell, except the one who has the mark, either the name of the beast or the number of his name.	66
NASB	Revelation	13	18	Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.	66
NASB	Revelation	13	2	And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.	66
NASB	Revelation	13	3	I saw one of his heads as if it had been slain, and his fatal wound was healed. And the whole earth was amazed and followed after the beast;	66
NASB	Revelation	13	4	They worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, &ldquo;Who is like the beast, and who is able to wage war with him?&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	13	5	There was given to him a mouth speaking arrogant words and blasphemies, and authority to act for forty-two months was given to him.	66
NASB	Revelation	13	6	And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, that is, those who dwell in heaven.	66
NASB	Revelation	13	7	It was also given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them, and authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation was given to him.	66
NASB	Revelation	13	8	All who dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been slain.	66
NASB	Revelation	13	9	If anyone has an ear, let him hear.	66
NASB	Revelation	14	1	Then I looked, and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.	66
NASB	Revelation	14	10	He also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed in full strength in the cup of His anger; and he will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.	66
NASB	Revelation	14	11	&ldquo;And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever; they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	14	12	Here is the perseverance of the saints who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.	66
NASB	Revelation	14	13	And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, &ldquo;Write, &lsquo;Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on!&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says the Spirit, &ldquo;so that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow with them.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	14	14	Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and sitting on the cloud was one like a son of man, having a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand.	66
NASB	Revelation	14	15	And another angel came out of the temple, crying out with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, &ldquo;Put in your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	14	16	Then He who sat on the cloud swung His sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped.	66
NASB	Revelation	14	17	And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle.	66
NASB	Revelation	14	18	Then another angel, the one who has power over fire, came out from the altar; and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, &ldquo;Put in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth, because her grapes are ripe.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	14	19	So the angel swung his sickle to the earth and gathered the clusters from the vine of the earth, and threw them into the great wine press of the wrath of God.	66
NASB	Revelation	14	2	And I heard a voice from heaven, like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder, and the voice which I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps.	66
NASB	Revelation	14	20	And the wine press was trodden outside the city, and blood came out from the wine press, up to the horses&rsquo; bridles, for a distance of two hundred miles.	66
NASB	Revelation	14	3	And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one could learn the song except the one hundred and forty-four thousand who had been purchased from the earth.	66
NASB	Revelation	14	4	These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, for they have kept themselves chaste. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These have been purchased from among men as first fruits to God and to the Lamb.	66
NASB	Revelation	14	5	And no lie was found in their mouth; they are blameless.	66
NASB	Revelation	14	6	And I saw another angel flying in midheaven, having an eternal gospel to preach to those who live on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people;	66
NASB	Revelation	14	7	And he said with a loud voice, &ldquo;Fear God, and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come; worship Him who made the heaven and the earth and sea and springs of waters.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	14	8	And another angel, a second one, followed, saying, &ldquo;Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who has made all the nations drink of the wine of the passion of her immorality.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	14	9	Then another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a loud voice, &ldquo;If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,	66
NASB	Revelation	15	1	Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels who had seven plagues, which are the last, because in them the wrath of God is finished.	66
NASB	Revelation	15	2	And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had been victorious over the beast and his image and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, holding harps of God.	66
NASB	Revelation	15	3	And they sang the song of Moses, the bond-servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, &ldquo;Great and marvelous are Your works, O Lord God, the Almighty; Righteous and true are Your ways, King of the nations!	66
NASB	Revelation	15	4	&ldquo;Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy; For ALL THE NATIONS WILL COME AND WORSHIP BEFORE YOU, FOR YOUR RIGHTEOUS ACTS HAVE BEEN REVEALED.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	15	5	After these things I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of testimony in heaven was opened,	66
NASB	Revelation	15	6	And the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in linen, clean and bright, and girded around their chests with golden sashes.	66
NASB	Revelation	15	7	Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.	66
NASB	Revelation	15	8	And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power; and no one was able to enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.	66
NASB	Revelation	16	1	Then I heard a loud voice from the temple, saying to the seven angels, &ldquo;Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	16	10	Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom became darkened; and they gnawed their tongues because of pain,	66
NASB	Revelation	16	11	And they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores; and they did not repent of their deeds.	66
NASB	Revelation	16	12	The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river, the Euphrates; and its water was dried up, so that the way would be prepared for the kings from the east.	66
NASB	Revelation	16	13	And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs;	66
NASB	Revelation	16	14	For they are spirits of demons, performing signs, which go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them together for the war of the great day of God, the Almighty.	66
NASB	Revelation	16	15	(&ldquo;Behold, I am coming like a thief. Blessed is the one who stays awake and keeps his clothes, so that he will not walk about naked and men will not see his shame.&rdquo;)	66
NASB	Revelation	16	16	And they gathered them together to the place which in Hebrew is called Har-Magedon.	66
NASB	Revelation	16	17	Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl upon the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne, saying, &ldquo;It is done.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	16	18	And there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder; and there was a great earthquake, such as there had not been since man came to be upon the earth, so great an earthquake was it, and so mighty.	66
NASB	Revelation	16	19	The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of His fierce wrath.	66
NASB	Revelation	16	2	So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth; and it became a loathsome and malignant sore on the people who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his image.	66
NASB	Revelation	16	20	And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.	66
NASB	Revelation	16	21	And huge hailstones, about one hundred pounds each, came down from heaven upon men; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, because its plague was extremely severe.	66
NASB	Revelation	16	3	The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood like that of a dead man; and every living thing in the sea died.	66
NASB	Revelation	16	4	Then the third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of waters; and they became blood.	66
NASB	Revelation	16	5	And I heard the angel of the waters saying, &ldquo;Righteous are You, who are and who were, O Holy One, because You judged these things;	66
NASB	Revelation	16	6	For they poured out the blood of saints and prophets, and You have given them blood to drink. They deserve it.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	16	7	And I heard the altar saying, &ldquo;Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgments.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	16	8	The fourth angel poured out his bowl upon the sun, and it was given to it to scorch men with fire.	66
NASB	Revelation	16	9	Men were scorched with fierce heat; and they blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues, and they did not repent so as to give Him glory.	66
NASB	Revelation	17	1	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, &ldquo;Come here, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters,	66
NASB	Revelation	17	10	And they are seven kings; five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain a little while.	66
NASB	Revelation	17	11	&ldquo;The beast which was and is not, is himself also an eighth and is one of the seven, and he goes to destruction.	66
NASB	Revelation	17	12	&ldquo;The ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour.	66
NASB	Revelation	17	13	&ldquo;These have one purpose, and they give their power and authority to the beast.	66
NASB	Revelation	17	14	&ldquo;These will wage war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, because He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those who are with Him are the called and chosen and faithful.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	17	15	And he said to me, &ldquo;The waters which you saw where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.	66
NASB	Revelation	17	16	&ldquo;And the ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh and will burn her up with fire.	66
NASB	Revelation	17	17	&ldquo;For God has put it in their hearts to execute His purpose by having a common purpose, and by giving their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God will be fulfilled.	66
NASB	Revelation	17	18	&ldquo;The woman whom you saw is the great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	17	2	With whom the kings of the earth committed acts of immorality, and those who dwell on the earth were made drunk with the wine of her immorality.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	17	3	And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness; and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns.	66
NASB	Revelation	17	4	The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a gold cup full of abominations and of the unclean things of her immorality,	66
NASB	Revelation	17	5	And on her forehead a name was written, a mystery, &ldquo;BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	17	6	And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered greatly.	66
NASB	Revelation	17	7	And the angel said to me, &ldquo;Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.	66
NASB	Revelation	17	8	&ldquo;The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and go to destruction. And those who dwell on the earth, whose name has not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will wonder when they see the beast, that he was and is not and will come.	66
NASB	Revelation	17	9	&ldquo;Here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits,	66
NASB	Revelation	18	1	After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was illumined with his glory.	66
NASB	Revelation	18	10	Standing at a distance because of the fear of her torment, saying, &lsquo;Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! For in one hour your judgment has come.&rsquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	18	11	&ldquo;And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargoes any more&mdash;	66
NASB	Revelation	18	12	Cargoes of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet, and every kind of citron wood and every article of ivory and every article made from very costly wood and bronze and iron and marble,	66
NASB	Revelation	18	13	And cinnamon and spice and incense and perfume and frankincense and wine and olive oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle and sheep, and cargoes of horses and chariots and slaves and human lives.	66
NASB	Revelation	18	14	&ldquo;The fruit you long for has gone from you, and all things that were luxurious and splendid have passed away from you and men will no longer find them.	66
NASB	Revelation	18	15	&ldquo;The merchants of these things, who became rich from her, will stand at a distance because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,	66
NASB	Revelation	18	16	Saying, &lsquo;Woe, woe, the great city, she who was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls;	66
NASB	Revelation	18	17	For in one hour such great wealth has been laid waste!&rsquo; And every shipmaster and every passenger and sailor, and as many as make their living by the sea, stood at a distance,	66
NASB	Revelation	18	18	And were crying out as they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, &lsquo;What city is like the great city?&rsquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	18	19	&ldquo;And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, weeping and mourning, saying, &lsquo;Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had ships at sea became rich by her wealth, for in one hour she has been laid waste!&rsquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	18	2	And he cried out with a mighty voice, saying, &ldquo;Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! She has become a dwelling place of demons and a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird.	66
NASB	Revelation	18	20	&ldquo;Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, because God has pronounced judgment for you against her.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	18	21	Then a strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, &ldquo;So will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down with violence, and will not be found any longer.	66
NASB	Revelation	18	22	&ldquo;And the sound of harpists and musicians and flute-players and trumpeters will not be heard in you any longer; and no craftsman of any craft will be found in you any longer; and the sound of a mill will not be heard in you any longer;	66
NASB	Revelation	18	23	And the light of a lamp will not shine in you any longer; and the voice of the bridegroom and bride will not be heard in you any longer; for your merchants were the great men of the earth, because all the nations were deceived by your sorcery.	66
NASB	Revelation	18	24	&ldquo;And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all who have been slain on the earth.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	18	3	&ldquo;For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the passion of her immorality, and the kings of the earth have committed acts of immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich by the wealth of her sensuality.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	18	4	I heard another voice from heaven, saying, &ldquo;Come out of her, my people, so that you will not participate in her sins and receive of her plagues;	66
NASB	Revelation	18	5	For her sins have piled up as high as heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.	66
NASB	Revelation	18	6	&ldquo;Pay her back even as she has paid, and give back to her double according to her deeds; in the cup which she has mixed, mix twice as much for her.	66
NASB	Revelation	18	7	&ldquo;To the degree that she glorified herself and lived sensuously, to the same degree give her torment and mourning; for she says in her heart, &lsquo;I SIT as A QUEEN AND I AM NOT A WIDOW, and will never see mourning.&rsquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	18	8	&ldquo;For this reason in one day her plagues will come, pestilence and mourning and famine, and she will be burned up with fire; for the Lord God who judges her is strong.	66
NASB	Revelation	18	9	&ldquo;And the kings of the earth, who committed acts of immorality and lived sensuously with her, will weep and lament over her when they see the smoke of her burning,	66
NASB	Revelation	19	1	After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, &ldquo;Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God;	66
NASB	Revelation	19	10	Then I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, &ldquo;Do not do that; I am a fellow servant of yours and your brethren who hold the testimony of Jesus; worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	19	11	And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sat on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and wages war.	66
NASB	Revelation	19	12	His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems; and He has a name written on Him which no one knows except Himself.	66
NASB	Revelation	19	13	He is clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God.	66
NASB	Revelation	19	14	And the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, were following Him on white horses.	66
NASB	Revelation	19	15	From His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty.	66
NASB	Revelation	19	16	And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written, &ldquo;KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	19	17	Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds which fly in midheaven, &ldquo;Come, assemble for the great supper of God,	66
NASB	Revelation	19	18	So that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of commanders and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them and the flesh of all men, both free men and slaves, and small and great.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	19	19	And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies assembled to make war against Him who sat on the horse and against His army.	66
NASB	Revelation	19	2	BECAUSE HIS JUDGMENTS ARE TRUE AND RIGHTEOUS; for He has judged the great harlot who was corrupting the earth with her immorality, and HE HAS AVENGED THE BLOOD OF HIS BOND-SERVANTS ON HER.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	19	20	And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who performed the signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image; these two were thrown alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone.	66
NASB	Revelation	19	21	And the rest were killed with the sword which came from the mouth of Him who sat on the horse, and all the birds were filled with their flesh.	66
NASB	Revelation	19	3	And a second time they said, &ldquo;Hallelujah! HER SMOKE RISES UP FOREVER AND EVER.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	19	4	And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne saying, &ldquo;Amen. Hallelujah!&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	19	5	And a voice came from the throne, saying, &ldquo;Give praise to our God, all you His bond-servants, you who fear Him, the small and the great.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	19	6	Then I heard something like the voice of a great multitude and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, saying, &ldquo;Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns.	66
NASB	Revelation	19	7	&ldquo;Let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come and His bride has made herself ready.&rdquo;	66

NASB	Revelation	2	14	&lsquo;But I have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who kept teaching Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit acts of immorality.	66
NASB	Revelation	2	15	&lsquo;So you also have some who in the same way hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans.	66

NASB	Revelation	2	19	&lsquo;I know your deeds, and your love and faith and service and perseverance, and that your deeds of late are greater than at first.	66
NASB	Revelation	2	2	&lsquo;I know your deeds and your toil and perseverance, and that you cannot tolerate evil men, and you put to the test those who call themselves apostles, and they are not, and you found them to be false;	66
NASB	Revelation	2	20	&lsquo;But I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and she teaches and leads My bond-servants astray so that they commit acts of immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols.	66
NASB	Revelation	2	21	&lsquo;I gave her time to repent, and she does not want to repent of her immorality.	66

NASB	Revelation	2	23	&lsquo;And I will kill her children with pestilence, and all the churches will know that I am He who searches the minds and hearts; and I will give to each one of you according to your deeds.	66
NASB	Revelation	2	24	&lsquo;But I say to you, the rest who are in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who have not known the deep things of Satan, as they call them&mdash;I place no other burden on you.	66

NASB	Revelation	2	4	&lsquo;But I have this against you, that you have left your first love.	66
NASB	Revelation	2	5	&lsquo;Therefore remember from where you have fallen, and repent and do the deeds you did at first; or else I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place&mdash;unless you repent.	66

NASB	Revelation	20	11	Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.	66
NASB	Revelation	20	12	And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to their deeds.	66
NASB	Revelation	20	13	And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one of them according to their deeds.	66

NASB	Revelation	20	2	And he laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years;	66
NASB	Revelation	20	3	And he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were completed; after these things he must be released for a short time.	66
NASB	Revelation	20	4	Then I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.	66
NASB	Revelation	20	5	The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection.	66
NASB	Revelation	20	6	Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.	66

NASB	Revelation	20	8	And will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the number of them is like the sand of the seashore.	66

NASB	Revelation	21	10	And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,	66
NASB	Revelation	21	11	Having the glory of God. Her brilliance was like a very costly stone, as a stone of crystal-clear jasper.	66

NASB	Revelation	21	17	And he measured its wall, seventy-two yards, according to human measurements, which are also angelic measurements.	66
NASB	Revelation	21	18	The material of the wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.	66
NASB	Revelation	21	19	The foundation stones of the city wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation stone was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;	66

NASB	Revelation	21	22	I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.	66
NASB	Revelation	21	23	And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God has illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.	66
NASB	Revelation	21	24	The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.	66
NASB	Revelation	21	25	In the daytime (for there will be no night there) its gates will never be closed;	66
NASB	Revelation	21	26	And they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it;	66
NASB	Revelation	21	27	And nothing unclean, and no one who practices abomination and lying, shall ever come into it, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb&rsquo;s book of life.	66
NASB	Revelation	21	3	And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, &ldquo;Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them,	66
NASB	Revelation	21	4	And He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	21	5	And He who sits on the throne said, &ldquo;Behold, I am making all things new.&rdquo; And He said, &ldquo;Write, for these words are faithful and true.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	21	6	Then He said to me, &ldquo;It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to the one who thirsts from the spring of the water of life without cost.	66
NASB	Revelation	21	7	&ldquo;He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son.	66
NASB	Revelation	21	8	&ldquo;But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	21	9	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, &ldquo;Come here, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	22	1	Then he showed me a river of the water of life, clear as crystal, coming from the throne of God and of the Lamb,	66
NASB	Revelation	22	10	And he said to me, &ldquo;Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near.	66
NASB	Revelation	22	11	&ldquo;Let the one who does wrong, still do wrong; and the one who is filthy, still be filthy; and let the one who is righteous, still practice righteousness; and the one who is holy, still keep himself holy.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	22	12	&ldquo;Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to render to every man according to what he has done.	66
NASB	Revelation	22	13	&ldquo;I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	22	14	Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city.	66
NASB	Revelation	22	15	Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the immoral persons and the murderers and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices lying.	66
NASB	Revelation	22	16	&ldquo;I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	22	17	The Spirit and the bride say, &ldquo;Come.&rdquo; And let the one who hears say, &ldquo;Come.&rdquo; And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who wishes take the water of life without cost.	66
NASB	Revelation	22	18	I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues which are written in this book;	66
NASB	Revelation	22	19	And if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and from the holy city, which are written in this book.	66
NASB	Revelation	22	2	In the middle of its street. On either side of the river was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.	66
NASB	Revelation	22	20	He who testifies to these things says, &ldquo;Yes, I am coming quickly.&rdquo; Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.	66
NASB	Revelation	22	21	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen.	66
NASB	Revelation	22	3	There will no longer be any curse; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His bond-servants will serve Him;	66
NASB	Revelation	22	4	They will see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads.	66
NASB	Revelation	22	5	And there will no longer be any night; and they will not have need of the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun, because the Lord God will illumine them; and they will reign forever and ever.	66
NASB	Revelation	22	6	And he said to me, &ldquo;These words are faithful and true&rdquo;; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent His angel to show to His bond-servants the things which must soon take place.	66
NASB	Revelation	22	7	&ldquo;And behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is he who heeds the words of the prophecy of this book.&rdquo;	66

NASB	Revelation	22	9	But he said to me, &ldquo;Do not do that. I am a fellow servant of yours and of your brethren the prophets and of those who heed the words of this book. Worship God.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	3	1	&ldquo;To the angel of the church in Sardis write: He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars, says this: &lsquo;I know your deeds, that you have a name that you are alive, but you are dead.	66
NASB	Revelation	3	10	&lsquo;Because you have kept the word of My perseverance, I also will keep you from the hour of testing, that hour which is about to come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth.	66
NASB	Revelation	3	11	&lsquo;I am coming quickly; hold fast what you have, so that no one will take your crown.	66
NASB	Revelation	3	12	&lsquo;He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he will not go out from it anymore; and I will write on him the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God, and My new name.	66
NASB	Revelation	3	13	&lsquo;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.&rsquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	3	14	&ldquo;To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: The Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God, says this:	66
NASB	Revelation	3	15	&lsquo;I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot.	66
NASB	Revelation	3	16	&lsquo;So because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of My mouth.	66
NASB	Revelation	3	17	&lsquo;Because you say, &ldquo;I am rich, and have become wealthy, and have need of nothing,&rdquo; and you do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked,	66
NASB	Revelation	3	18	I advise you to buy from Me gold refined by fire so that you may become rich, and white garments so that you may clothe yourself, and that the shame of your nakedness will not be revealed; and eye salve to anoint your eyes so that you may see.	66
NASB	Revelation	3	19	&lsquo;Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline; therefore be zealous and repent.	66
NASB	Revelation	3	2	&lsquo;Wake up, and strengthen the things that remain, which were about to die; for I have not found your deeds completed in the sight of My God.	66
NASB	Revelation	3	20	&lsquo;Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he with Me.	66
NASB	Revelation	3	21	&lsquo;He who overcomes, I will grant to him to sit down with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne.	66
NASB	Revelation	3	22	&lsquo;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.&rsquo;&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	3	3	&lsquo;So remember what you have received and heard; and keep it, and repent. Therefore if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come to you.	66
NASB	Revelation	3	4	&lsquo;But you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their garments; and they will walk with Me in white, for they are worthy.	66
NASB	Revelation	3	5	&lsquo;He who overcomes will thus be clothed in white garments; and I will not erase his name from the book of life, and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.	66
NASB	Revelation	3	6	&lsquo;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.&rsquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	3	7	&ldquo;And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: He who is holy, who is true, who has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, and who shuts and no one opens, says this:	66
NASB	Revelation	3	8	&lsquo;I know your deeds. Behold, I have put before you an open door which no one can shut, because you have a little power, and have kept My word, and have not denied My name.	66
NASB	Revelation	3	9	&lsquo;Behold, I will cause those of the synagogue of Satan, who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie&mdash;I will make them come and bow down at your feet, and make them know that I have loved you.	66
NASB	Revelation	5	1	I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a book written inside and on the back, sealed up with seven seals.	66
NASB	Revelation	5	10	&ldquo;You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign upon the earth.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	5	11	Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands,	66
NASB	Revelation	5	12	Saying with a loud voice, &ldquo;Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	5	13	And every created thing which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all things in them, I heard saying, &ldquo;To Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	5	14	And the four living creatures kept saying, &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; And the elders fell down and worshiped.	66
NASB	Revelation	5	2	And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, &ldquo;Who is worthy to open the book and to break its seals?&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	5	3	And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to look into it.	66
NASB	Revelation	5	4	Then I began to weep greatly because no one was found worthy to open the book or to look into it;	66
NASB	Revelation	5	5	And one of the elders said to me, &ldquo;Stop weeping; behold, the Lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome so as to open the book and its seven seals.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	5	6	And I saw between the throne (with the four living creatures) and the elders a Lamb standing, as if slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth.	66
NASB	Revelation	5	7	And He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne.	66
NASB	Revelation	5	8	When He had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.	66
NASB	Revelation	5	9	And they sang a new song, saying, &ldquo;Worthy are You to take the book and to break its seals; for You were slain, and purchased for God with Your blood men from every tribe and tongue and people and nation.	66
NASB	Revelation	6	1	Then I saw when the Lamb broke one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as with a voice of thunder, &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	6	10	And they cried out with a loud voice, saying, &ldquo;How long, O Lord, holy and true, will You refrain from judging and avenging our blood on those who dwell on the earth?&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	6	11	And there was given to each of them a white robe; and they were told that they should rest for a little while longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brethren who were to be killed even as they had been, would be completed also.	66
NASB	Revelation	6	12	I looked when He broke the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became like blood;	66
NASB	Revelation	6	13	And the stars of the sky fell to the earth, as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind.	66
NASB	Revelation	6	14	The sky was split apart like a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.	66
NASB	Revelation	6	15	Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the commanders and the rich and the strong and every slave and free man hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains;	66
NASB	Revelation	6	16	And they said to the mountains and to the rocks, &ldquo;Fall on us and hide us from the presence of Him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb;	66
NASB	Revelation	6	17	For the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	6	2	I looked, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer.	66
NASB	Revelation	6	3	When He broke the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	6	4	And another, a red horse, went out; and to him who sat on it, it was granted to take peace from the earth, and that men would slay one another; and a great sword was given to him.	66
NASB	Revelation	6	5	When He broke the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, &ldquo;Come.&rdquo; I looked, and behold, a black horse; and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand.	66
NASB	Revelation	6	6	And I heard something like a voice in the center of the four living creatures saying, &ldquo;A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not damage the oil and the wine.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	6	7	When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	6	8	I looked, and behold, an ashen horse; and he who sat on it had the name Death; and Hades was following with him. Authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by the wild beasts of the earth.	66
NASB	Revelation	6	9	When the Lamb broke the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God, and because of the testimony which they had maintained;	66
NASB	Revelation	7	1	After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth or on the sea or on any tree.	66
NASB	Revelation	7	10	And they cry out with a loud voice, saying, &ldquo;Salvation to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	7	11	And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,	66
NASB	Revelation	7	12	Saying, &ldquo;Amen, blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might, be to our God forever and ever. Amen.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	7	13	Then one of the elders answered, saying to me, &ldquo;These who are clothed in the white robes, who are they, and where have they come from?&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	7	14	I said to him, &ldquo;My lord, you know.&rdquo; And he said to me, &ldquo;These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.	66
NASB	Revelation	7	15	&ldquo;For this reason, they are before the throne of God; and they serve Him day and night in His temple; and He who sits on the throne will spread His tabernacle over them.	66
NASB	Revelation	7	16	&ldquo;They will hunger no longer, nor thirst anymore; nor will the sun beat down on them, nor any heat;	66
NASB	Revelation	7	17	For the Lamb in the center of the throne will be their shepherd, and will guide them to springs of the water of life; and God will wipe every tear from their eyes.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	7	2	And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God; and he cried out with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea,	66
NASB	Revelation	7	3	Saying, &ldquo;Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the bond-servants of our God on their foreheads.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	7	4	And I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred and forty-four thousand sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:	66
NASB	Revelation	7	5	From the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand were sealed, from the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand, from the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,	66
NASB	Revelation	7	6	From the tribe of Asher twelve thousand, from the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand, from the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,	66
NASB	Revelation	7	7	From the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand, from the tribe of Levi twelve thousand, from the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand,	66
NASB	Revelation	7	8	From the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand, from the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand, from the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand were sealed.	66
NASB	Revelation	7	9	After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one could count, from every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palm branches were in their hands;	66
NASB	Revelation	8	1	When the Lamb broke the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.	66
NASB	Revelation	8	10	The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of waters.	66
NASB	Revelation	8	11	The name of the star is called Wormwood; and a third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.	66
NASB	Revelation	8	12	The fourth angel sounded, and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were struck, so that a third of them would be darkened and the day would not shine for a third of it, and the night in the same way.	66
NASB	Revelation	8	13	Then I looked, and I heard an eagle flying in midheaven, saying with a loud voice, &ldquo;Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	8	2	And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.	66
NASB	Revelation	8	3	Another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a golden censer; and much incense was given to him, so that he might add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.	66
NASB	Revelation	8	4	And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel&rsquo;s hand.	66
NASB	Revelation	8	5	Then the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it to the earth; and there followed peals of thunder and sounds and flashes of lightning and an earthquake.	66
NASB	Revelation	8	6	And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them.	66
NASB	Revelation	8	7	The first sounded, and there came hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth; and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.	66
NASB	Revelation	8	8	The second angel sounded, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea; and a third of the sea became blood,	66
NASB	Revelation	8	9	And a third of the creatures which were in the sea and had life, died; and a third of the ships were destroyed.	66
NASB	Revelation	9	1	Then the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from heaven which had fallen to the earth; and the key of the bottomless pit was given to him.	66
NASB	Revelation	9	10	They have tails like scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt men for five months.	66
NASB	Revelation	9	11	They have as king over them, the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek he has the name Apollyon.	66
NASB	Revelation	9	12	The first woe is past; behold, two woes are still coming after these things.	66
NASB	Revelation	9	13	Then the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,	66
NASB	Revelation	9	14	One saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, &ldquo;Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.&rdquo;	66
NASB	Revelation	9	15	And the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, were released, so that they would kill a third of mankind.	66
NASB	Revelation	9	16	The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million; I heard the number of them.	66
NASB	Revelation	9	17	And this is how I saw in the vision the horses and those who sat on them: the riders had breastplates the color of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone; and the heads of the horses are like the heads of lions; and out of their mouths proceed fire and smoke and brimstone.	66
NASB	Revelation	9	18	A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which proceeded out of their mouths.	66
NASB	Revelation	9	19	For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents and have heads, and with them they do harm.	66
NASB	Revelation	9	2	He opened the bottomless pit, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit.	66
NASB	Revelation	9	20	The rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, so as not to worship demons, and the idols of gold and of silver and of brass and of stone and of wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk;	66
NASB	Revelation	9	21	And they did not repent of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their immorality nor of their thefts.	66
NASB	Revelation	9	3	Then out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth, and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.	66
NASB	Revelation	9	4	They were told not to hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only the men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.	66
NASB	Revelation	9	5	And they were not permitted to kill anyone, but to torment for five months; and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings a man.	66
NASB	Revelation	9	6	And in those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, and death flees from them.	66
NASB	Revelation	9	7	The appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle; and on their heads appeared to be crowns like gold, and their faces were like the faces of men.	66
NASB	Revelation	9	8	They had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like the teeth of lions.	66
NASB	Revelation	9	9	They had breastplates like breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, of many horses rushing to battle.	66
NASB	Romans	1	1	Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,	45
NASB	Romans	1	10	Always in my prayers making request, if perhaps now at last by the will of God I may succeed in coming to you.	45
NASB	Romans	1	11	For I long to see you so that I may impart some spiritual gift to you, that you may be established;	45
NASB	Romans	1	12	That is, that I may be encouraged together with you while among you, each of us by the other&rsquo;s faith, both yours and mine.	45
NASB	Romans	1	13	I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that often I have planned to come to you (and have been prevented so far) so that I may obtain some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles.	45
NASB	Romans	1	14	I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.	45
NASB	Romans	1	15	So, for my part, I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.	45
NASB	Romans	1	16	For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.	45
NASB	Romans	1	17	For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, &ldquo;BUT THE RIGHTEOUS man SHALL LIVE BY FAITH.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	1	18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,	45
NASB	Romans	1	19	Because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them.	45
NASB	Romans	1	2	Which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures,	45
NASB	Romans	1	20	For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.	45
NASB	Romans	1	21	For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened.	45
NASB	Romans	1	22	Professing to be wise, they became fools,	45
NASB	Romans	1	23	And exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures.	45
NASB	Romans	1	24	Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them.	45
NASB	Romans	1	25	For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.	45
NASB	Romans	1	26	For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural,	45
NASB	Romans	1	27	And in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.	45
NASB	Romans	1	28	And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper,	45
NASB	Romans	1	29	Being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; they are gossips,	45
NASB	Romans	1	3	Concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh,	45
NASB	Romans	1	30	Slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,	45
NASB	Romans	1	31	Without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful;	45
NASB	Romans	1	32	And although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.	45
NASB	Romans	1	4	Who was declared the Son of God with power by the resurrection from the dead, according to the Spirit of holiness, Jesus Christ our Lord,	45
NASB	Romans	1	5	Through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles for His name&rsquo;s sake,	45
NASB	Romans	1	6	Among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ;	45
NASB	Romans	1	7	To all who are beloved of God in Rome, called as saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	45
NASB	Romans	1	8	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because your faith is being proclaimed throughout the whole world.	45
NASB	Romans	1	9	For God, whom I serve in my spirit in the preaching of the gospel of His Son, is my witness as to how unceasingly I make mention of you,	45
NASB	Romans	10	1	Brethren, my heart&rsquo;s desire and my prayer to God for them is for their salvation.	45
NASB	Romans	10	10	For with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.	45
NASB	Romans	10	11	For the Scripture says, &ldquo;WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	10	12	For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on Him;	45
NASB	Romans	10	13	For &ldquo;WHOEVER WILL CALL ON THE NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	10	14	How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher?	45
NASB	Romans	10	15	How will they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written, &ldquo;HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE THE FEET OF THOSE WHO BRING GOOD NEWS OF GOOD THINGS!&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	10	16	However, they did not all heed the good news; for Isaiah says, &ldquo;LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT?&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	10	17	So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.	45
NASB	Romans	10	18	But I say, surely they have never heard, have they? Indeed they have; &ldquo;THEIR VOICE HAS GONE OUT INTO ALL THE EARTH, AND THEIR WORDS TO THE ENDS OF THE WORLD.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	10	19	But I say, surely Israel did not know, did they? First Moses says, &ldquo;I WILL MAKE YOU JEALOUS BY THAT WHICH IS NOT A NATION, BY A NATION WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WILL I ANGER YOU.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	10	2	For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not in accordance with knowledge.	45
NASB	Romans	10	20	And Isaiah is very bold and says, &ldquo;I WAS FOUND BY THOSE WHO DID NOT SEEK ME, I BECAME MANIFEST TO THOSE WHO DID NOT ASK FOR ME.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	10	21	But as for Israel He says, &ldquo;ALL THE DAY LONG I HAVE STRETCHED OUT MY HANDS TO A DISOBEDIENT AND OBSTINATE PEOPLE.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	10	3	For not knowing about God&rsquo;s righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.	45
NASB	Romans	10	4	For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.	45
NASB	Romans	10	5	For Moses writes that the man who practices the righteousness which is based on law shall live by that righteousness.	45
NASB	Romans	10	6	But the righteousness based on faith speaks as follows: &ldquo;DO NOT SAY IN YOUR HEART, &lsquo;WHO WILL ASCEND INTO HEAVEN?&rsquo; (that is, to bring Christ down),	45
NASB	Romans	10	7	Or &lsquo;WHO WILL DESCEND INTO THE ABYSS?&rsquo; (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	10	8	But what does it say? &ldquo;THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the word of faith which we are preaching,	45
NASB	Romans	10	9	That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;	45
NASB	Romans	11	1	I say then, God has not rejected His people, has He? May it never be! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.	45
NASB	Romans	11	10	&ldquo;LET THEIR EYES BE DARKENED TO SEE NOT, AND BEND THEIR BACKS FOREVER.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	11	11	I say then, they did not stumble so as to fall, did they? May it never be! But by their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make them jealous.	45
NASB	Romans	11	12	Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be!	45
NASB	Romans	11	13	But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I magnify my ministry,	45
NASB	Romans	11	14	If somehow I might move to jealousy my fellow countrymen and save some of them.	45
NASB	Romans	11	15	For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?	45
NASB	Romans	11	16	If the first piece of dough is holy, the lump is also; and if the root is holy, the branches are too.	45
NASB	Romans	11	17	But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the rich root of the olive tree,	45
NASB	Romans	11	18	Do not be arrogant toward the branches; but if you are arrogant, remember that it is not you who supports the root, but the root supports you.	45
NASB	Romans	11	19	You will say then, &ldquo;Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	11	2	God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?	45
NASB	Romans	11	20	Quite right, they were broken off for their unbelief, but you stand by your faith. Do not be conceited, but fear;	45
NASB	Romans	11	21	For if God did not spare the natural branches, He will not spare you, either.	45
NASB	Romans	11	22	Behold then the kindness and severity of God; to those who fell, severity, but to you, God&rsquo;s kindness, if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.	45
NASB	Romans	11	23	And they also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.	45
NASB	Romans	11	24	For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these who are the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree?	45
NASB	Romans	11	25	For I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this mystery&mdash;so that you will not be wise in your own estimation&mdash;that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in;	45
NASB	Romans	11	26	And so all Israel will be saved; just as it is written, &ldquo;THE DELIVERER WILL COME FROM ZION, HE WILL REMOVE UNGODLINESS FROM JACOB.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	11	27	&ldquo;THIS IS MY COVENANT WITH THEM, WHEN I TAKE AWAY THEIR SINS.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	11	28	From the standpoint of the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but from the standpoint of God&rsquo;s choice they are beloved for the sake of the fathers;	45
NASB	Romans	11	29	For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.	45
NASB	Romans	11	3	&ldquo;Lord, THEY HAVE KILLED YOUR PROPHETS, THEY HAVE TORN DOWN YOUR ALTARS, AND I ALONE AM LEFT, AND THEY ARE SEEKING MY LIFE.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	11	30	For just as you once were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience,	45
NASB	Romans	11	31	So these also now have been disobedient, that because of the mercy shown to you they also may now be shown mercy.	45
NASB	Romans	11	32	For God has shut up all in disobedience so that He may show mercy to all.	45
NASB	Romans	11	33	Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways!	45
NASB	Romans	11	34	For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, OR WHO BECAME HIS COUNSELOR?	45
NASB	Romans	11	35	Or WHO HAS FIRST GIVEN TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE PAID BACK TO HIM AGAIN?	45
NASB	Romans	11	36	For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen.	45
NASB	Romans	11	4	But what is the divine response to him? &ldquo;I HAVE KEPT for Myself SEVEN THOUSAND MEN WHO HAVE NOT BOWED THE KNEE TO BAAL.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	11	5	In the same way then, there has also come to be at the present time a remnant according to God&rsquo;s gracious choice.	45
NASB	Romans	11	6	But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace is no longer grace.	45
NASB	Romans	11	7	What then? What Israel is seeking, it has not obtained, but those who were chosen obtained it, and the rest were hardened;	45
NASB	Romans	11	8	Just as it is written, &ldquo;GOD GAVE THEM A SPIRIT OF STUPOR, EYES TO SEE NOT AND EARS TO HEAR NOT, DOWN TO THIS VERY DAY.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	11	9	And David says, &ldquo;LET THEIR TABLE BECOME A SNARE AND A TRAP, AND A STUMBLING BLOCK AND A RETRIBUTION TO THEM.	45
NASB	Romans	12	1	Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.	45
NASB	Romans	12	10	Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; give preference to one another in honor;	45
NASB	Romans	12	11	Not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord;	45
NASB	Romans	12	12	Rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation, devoted to prayer,	45
NASB	Romans	12	13	Contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality.	45
NASB	Romans	12	14	Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.	45
NASB	Romans	12	15	Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.	45
NASB	Romans	12	16	Be of the same mind toward one another; do not be haughty in mind, but associate with the lowly. Do not be wise in your own estimation.	45
NASB	Romans	12	17	Never pay back evil for evil to anyone. Respect what is right in the sight of all men.	45
NASB	Romans	12	18	If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men.	45
NASB	Romans	12	19	Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is written, &ldquo;VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY,&rdquo; says the Lord.	45
NASB	Romans	12	2	And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.	45
NASB	Romans	12	20	&ldquo;BUT IF YOUR ENEMY IS HUNGRY, FEED HIM, AND IF HE IS THIRSTY, GIVE HIM A DRINK; FOR IN SO DOING YOU WILL HEAP BURNING COALS ON HIS HEAD.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	12	21	Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.	45
NASB	Romans	12	3	For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.	45
NASB	Romans	12	4	For just as we have many members in one body and all the members do not have the same function,	45
NASB	Romans	12	5	So we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.	45
NASB	Romans	12	6	Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, each of us is to exercise them accordingly: if prophecy, according to the proportion of his faith;	45
NASB	Romans	12	7	If service, in his serving; or he who teaches, in his teaching;	45
NASB	Romans	12	8	Or he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.	45
NASB	Romans	12	9	Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil; cling to what is good.	45
NASB	Romans	13	1	Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God.	45
NASB	Romans	13	10	Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.	45
NASB	Romans	13	11	Do this, knowing the time, that it is already the hour for you to awaken from sleep; for now salvation is nearer to us than when we believed.	45
NASB	Romans	13	12	The night is almost gone, and the day is near. Therefore let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.	45
NASB	Romans	13	13	Let us behave properly as in the day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and sensuality, not in strife and jealousy.	45
NASB	Romans	13	14	But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh in regard to its lusts.	45
NASB	Romans	13	2	Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.	45
NASB	Romans	13	3	For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same;	45
NASB	Romans	13	4	For it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil.	45
NASB	Romans	13	5	Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also for conscience&rsquo; sake.	45
NASB	Romans	13	6	For because of this you also pay taxes, for rulers are servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing.	45
NASB	Romans	13	7	Render to all what is due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.	45
NASB	Romans	13	8	Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.	45
NASB	Romans	13	9	For this, &ldquo;YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY, YOU SHALL NOT MURDER, YOU SHALL NOT STEAL, YOU SHALL NOT COVET,&rdquo; and if there is any other commandment, it is summed up in this saying, &ldquo;YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	14	1	Now accept the one who is weak in faith, but not for the purpose of passing judgment on his opinions.	45
NASB	Romans	14	10	But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you regard your brother with contempt? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God.	45
NASB	Romans	14	11	For it is written, &ldquo;AS I LIVE, SAYS THE LORD, EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW TO ME, AND EVERY TONGUE SHALL GIVE PRAISE TO GOD.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	14	12	So then each one of us will give an account of himself to God.	45
NASB	Romans	14	13	Therefore let us not judge one another anymore, but rather determine this&mdash;not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block in a brother&rsquo;s way.	45
NASB	Romans	14	14	I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; but to him who thinks anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.	45
NASB	Romans	14	15	For if because of food your brother is hurt, you are no longer walking according to love. Do not destroy with your food him for whom Christ died.	45
NASB	Romans	14	16	Therefore do not let what is for you a good thing be spoken of as evil;	45
NASB	Romans	14	17	For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.	45
NASB	Romans	14	18	For he who in this way serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men.	45
NASB	Romans	14	19	So then we pursue the things which make for peace and the building up of one another.	45
NASB	Romans	14	2	One person has faith that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables only.	45
NASB	Romans	14	20	Do not tear down the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed are clean, but they are evil for the man who eats and gives offense.	45
NASB	Romans	14	21	It is good not to eat meat or to drink wine, or to do anything by which your brother stumbles.	45
NASB	Romans	14	22	The faith which you have, have as your own conviction before God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves.	45
NASB	Romans	14	23	But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and whatever is not from faith is sin.	45
NASB	Romans	14	3	The one who eats is not to regard with contempt the one who does not eat, and the one who does not eat is not to judge the one who eats, for God has accepted him.	45
NASB	Romans	14	4	Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master he stands or falls; and he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.	45
NASB	Romans	14	5	One person regards one day above another, another regards every day alike. Each person must be fully convinced in his own mind.	45
NASB	Romans	14	6	He who observes the day, observes it for the Lord, and he who eats, does so for the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who eats not, for the Lord he does not eat, and gives thanks to God.	45
NASB	Romans	14	7	For not one of us lives for himself, and not one dies for himself;	45
NASB	Romans	14	8	For if we live, we live for the Lord, or if we die, we die for the Lord; therefore whether we live or die, we are the Lord&rsquo;s.	45
NASB	Romans	14	9	For to this end Christ died and lived again, that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.	45
NASB	Romans	15	1	Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those without strength and not just please ourselves.	45
NASB	Romans	15	10	Again he says, &ldquo;REJOICE, O GENTILES, WITH HIS PEOPLE.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	15	11	And again, &ldquo;PRAISE THE LORD ALL YOU GENTILES, AND LET ALL THE PEOPLES PRAISE HIM.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	15	12	Again Isaiah says, &ldquo;THERE SHALL COME THE ROOT OF JESSE, AND HE WHO ARISES TO RULE OVER THE GENTILES, IN HIM SHALL THE GENTILES HOPE.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	15	13	Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you will abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.	45
NASB	Romans	15	14	And concerning you, my brethren, I myself also am convinced that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able also to admonish one another.	45
NASB	Romans	15	15	But I have written very boldly to you on some points so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given me from God,	45
NASB	Romans	15	16	To be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, so that my offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.	45
NASB	Romans	15	17	Therefore in Christ Jesus I have found reason for boasting in things pertaining to God.	45
NASB	Romans	15	18	For I will not presume to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me, resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed,	45
NASB	Romans	15	19	In the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit; so that from Jerusalem and round about as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.	45
NASB	Romans	15	2	Each of us is to please his neighbor for his good, to his edification.	45
NASB	Romans	15	20	And thus I aspired to preach the gospel, not where Christ was already named, so that I would not build on another man&rsquo;s foundation;	45
NASB	Romans	15	21	But as it is written, &ldquo;THEY WHO HAD NO NEWS OF HIM SHALL SEE, AND THEY WHO HAVE NOT HEARD SHALL UNDERSTAND.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	15	22	For this reason I have often been prevented from coming to you;	45
NASB	Romans	15	23	But now, with no further place for me in these regions, and since I have had for many years a longing to come to you	45
NASB	Romans	15	24	Whenever I go to Spain&mdash;for I hope to see you in passing, and to be helped on my way there by you, when I have first enjoyed your company for a while&mdash;	45
NASB	Romans	15	25	But now, I am going to Jerusalem serving the saints.	45
NASB	Romans	15	26	For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.	45
NASB	Romans	15	27	Yes, they were pleased to do so, and they are indebted to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they are indebted to minister to them also in material things.	45
NASB	Romans	15	28	Therefore, when I have finished this, and have put my seal on this fruit of theirs, I will go on by way of you to Spain.	45
NASB	Romans	15	29	I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.	45
NASB	Romans	15	3	For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written, &ldquo;THE REPROACHES OF THOSE WHO REPROACHED YOU FELL ON ME.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	15	30	Now I urge you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,	45
NASB	Romans	15	31	That I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may prove acceptable to the saints;	45
NASB	Romans	15	32	So that I may come to you in joy by the will of God and find refreshing rest in your company.	45
NASB	Romans	15	33	Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.	45
NASB	Romans	15	4	For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction, so that through perseverance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.	45
NASB	Romans	15	5	Now may the God who gives perseverance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind with one another according to Christ Jesus,	45
NASB	Romans	15	6	So that with one accord you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.	45
NASB	Romans	15	7	Therefore, accept one another, just as Christ also accepted us to the glory of God.	45
NASB	Romans	15	8	For I say that Christ has become a servant to the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God to confirm the promises given to the fathers,	45
NASB	Romans	15	9	And for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy; as it is written, &ldquo;THEREFORE I WILL GIVE PRAISE TO YOU AMONG THE GENTILES, AND I WILL SING TO YOUR NAME.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	16	1	I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea;	45
NASB	Romans	16	10	Greet Apelles, the approved in Christ. Greet those who are of the household of Aristobulus.	45
NASB	Romans	16	11	Greet Herodion, my kinsman. Greet those of the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord.	45
NASB	Romans	16	12	Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, workers in the Lord. Greet Persis the beloved, who has worked hard in the Lord.	45
NASB	Romans	16	13	Greet Rufus, a choice man in the Lord, also his mother and mine.	45
NASB	Romans	16	14	Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas and the brethren with them.	45
NASB	Romans	16	15	Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.	45
NASB	Romans	16	16	Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you.	45
NASB	Romans	16	17	Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who cause dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned, and turn away from them.	45
NASB	Romans	16	18	For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ but of their own appetites; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting.	45
NASB	Romans	16	19	For the report of your obedience has reached to all; therefore I am rejoicing over you, but I want you to be wise in what is good and innocent in what is evil.	45
NASB	Romans	16	2	That you receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, and that you help her in whatever matter she may have need of you; for she herself has also been a helper of many, and of myself as well.	45
NASB	Romans	16	20	The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.	45
NASB	Romans	16	21	Timothy my fellow worker greets you, and so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen.	45
NASB	Romans	16	22	I, Tertius, who write this letter, greet you in the Lord.	45
NASB	Romans	16	23	Gaius, host to me and to the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the city treasurer greets you, and Quartus, the brother.	45
NASB	Romans	16	24	[The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.]	45
NASB	Romans	16	25	Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past,	45
NASB	Romans	16	26	But now is manifested, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations, leading to obedience of faith;	45
NASB	Romans	16	27	To the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be the glory forever. Amen.	45
NASB	Romans	16	3	Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,	45
NASB	Romans	16	4	Who for my life risked their own necks, to whom not only do I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles;	45
NASB	Romans	16	5	Also greet the church that is in their house. Greet Epaenetus, my beloved, who is the first convert to Christ from Asia.	45
NASB	Romans	16	6	Greet Mary, who has worked hard for you.	45
NASB	Romans	16	7	Greet Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners, who are outstanding among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.	45
NASB	Romans	16	8	Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord.	45
NASB	Romans	16	9	Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.	45
NASB	Romans	2	1	Therefore you have no excuse, everyone of you who passes judgment, for in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things.	45
NASB	Romans	2	10	But glory and honor and peace to everyone who does good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.	45
NASB	Romans	2	11	For there is no partiality with God.	45
NASB	Romans	2	12	For all who have sinned without the Law will also perish without the Law, and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged by the Law;	45
NASB	Romans	2	13	For it is not the hearers of the Law who are just before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified.	45
NASB	Romans	2	14	For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves,	45
NASB	Romans	2	15	In that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them,	45
NASB	Romans	2	16	On the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the secrets of men through Christ Jesus.	45
NASB	Romans	2	17	But if you bear the name &ldquo;Jew&rdquo; and rely upon the Law and boast in God,	45
NASB	Romans	2	18	And know His will and approve the things that are essential, being instructed out of the Law,	45
NASB	Romans	2	19	And are confident that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,	45
NASB	Romans	2	2	And we know that the judgment of God rightly falls upon those who practice such things.	45
NASB	Romans	2	20	A corrector of the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth,	45
NASB	Romans	2	21	You, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that one shall not steal, do you steal?	45
NASB	Romans	2	22	You who say that one should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?	45
NASB	Romans	2	23	You who boast in the Law, through your breaking the Law, do you dishonor God?	45
NASB	Romans	2	24	For &ldquo;THE NAME OF GOD IS BLASPHEMED AMONG THE GENTILES BECAUSE OF YOU,&rdquo; just as it is written.	45
NASB	Romans	2	25	For indeed circumcision is of value if you practice the Law; but if you are a transgressor of the Law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.	45
NASB	Romans	2	26	So if the uncircumcised man keeps the requirements of the Law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?	45
NASB	Romans	2	27	And he who is physically uncircumcised, if he keeps the Law, will he not judge you who though having the letter of the Law and circumcision are a transgressor of the Law?	45
NASB	Romans	2	28	For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh.	45
NASB	Romans	2	29	But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that which is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter; and his praise is not from men, but from God.	45
NASB	Romans	2	3	But do you suppose this, O man, when you pass judgment on those who practice such things and do the same yourself, that you will escape the judgment of God?	45
NASB	Romans	2	4	Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and tolerance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?	45
NASB	Romans	2	5	But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,	45
NASB	Romans	2	6	Who WILL RENDER TO EACH PERSON ACCORDING TO HIS DEEDS:	45
NASB	Romans	2	7	To those who by perseverance in doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life;	45
NASB	Romans	2	8	But to those who are selfishly ambitious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, wrath and indignation.	45
NASB	Romans	2	9	There will be tribulation and distress for every soul of man who does evil, of the Jew first and also of the Greek,	45
NASB	Romans	3	1	Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the benefit of circumcision?	45
NASB	Romans	3	10	As it is written, &ldquo;THERE IS NONE RIGHTEOUS, NOT EVEN ONE;	45
NASB	Romans	3	11	THERE IS NONE WHO UNDERSTANDS, THERE IS NONE WHO SEEKS FOR GOD;	45
NASB	Romans	3	12	ALL HAVE TURNED ASIDE, TOGETHER THEY HAVE BECOME USELESS; THERE IS NONE WHO DOES GOOD, THERE IS NOT EVEN ONE.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	3	13	&ldquo;THEIR THROAT IS AN OPEN GRAVE, WITH THEIR TONGUES THEY KEEP DECEIVING,&rdquo; &ldquo;THE POISON OF ASPS IS UNDER THEIR LIPS&rdquo;;	45
NASB	Romans	3	14	&ldquo;WHOSE MOUTH IS FULL OF CURSING AND BITTERNESS&rdquo;;	45
NASB	Romans	3	15	&ldquo;THEIR FEET ARE SWIFT TO SHED BLOOD,	45
NASB	Romans	3	16	DESTRUCTION AND MISERY ARE IN THEIR PATHS,	45
NASB	Romans	3	17	AND THE PATH OF PEACE THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	3	18	&ldquo;THERE IS NO FEAR OF GOD BEFORE THEIR EYES.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	3	19	Now we know that whatever the Law says, it speaks to those who are under the Law, so that every mouth may be closed and all the world may become accountable to God;	45
NASB	Romans	3	2	Great in every respect. First of all, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God.	45
NASB	Romans	3	20	Because by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law comes the knowledge of sin.	45
NASB	Romans	3	21	But now apart from the Law the righteousness of God has been manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,	45
NASB	Romans	3	22	Even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe; for there is no distinction;	45
NASB	Romans	3	23	For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,	45
NASB	Romans	3	24	Being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus;	45
NASB	Romans	3	25	Whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood through faith. This was to demonstrate His righteousness, because in the forbearance of God He passed over the sins previously committed;	45
NASB	Romans	3	26	For the demonstration, I say, of His righteousness at the present time, so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.	45
NASB	Romans	3	27	Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith.	45
NASB	Romans	3	28	For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law.	45
NASB	Romans	3	29	Or is God the God of Jews only? Is He not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,	45
NASB	Romans	3	3	What then? If some did not believe, their unbelief will not nullify the faithfulness of God, will it?	45
NASB	Romans	3	30	Since indeed God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith is one.	45
NASB	Romans	3	31	Do we then nullify the Law through faith? May it never be! On the contrary, we establish the Law.	45
NASB	Romans	3	4	May it never be! Rather, let God be found true, though every man be found a liar, as it is written, &ldquo;THAT YOU MAY BE JUSTIFIED IN YOUR WORDS, AND PREVAIL WHEN YOU ARE JUDGED.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	3	5	But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? The God who inflicts wrath is not unrighteous, is He? (I am speaking in human terms.)	45
NASB	Romans	3	6	May it never be! For otherwise, how will God judge the world?	45
NASB	Romans	3	7	But if through my lie the truth of God abounded to His glory, why am I also still being judged as a sinner?	45
NASB	Romans	3	8	And why not say (as we are slanderously reported and as some claim that we say), &ldquo;Let us do evil that good may come&rdquo;? Their condemnation is just.	45
NASB	Romans	3	9	What then? Are we better than they? Not at all; for we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin;	45
NASB	Romans	4	1	What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has found?	45
NASB	Romans	4	10	How then was it credited? While he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? Not while circumcised, but while uncircumcised;	45
NASB	Romans	4	11	And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while uncircumcised, so that he might be the father of all who believe without being circumcised, that righteousness might be credited to them,	45
NASB	Romans	4	12	And the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also follow in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had while uncircumcised.	45
NASB	Romans	4	13	For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he would be heir of the world was not through the Law, but through the righteousness of faith.	45
NASB	Romans	4	14	For if those who are of the Law are heirs, faith is made void and the promise is nullified;	45
NASB	Romans	4	15	For the Law brings about wrath, but where there is no law, there also is no violation.	45
NASB	Romans	4	16	For this reason it is by faith, in order that it may be in accordance with grace, so that the promise will be guaranteed to all the descendants, not only to those who are of the Law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,	45
NASB	Romans	4	17	(as it is written, &ldquo;A FATHER OF MANY NATIONS HAVE I MADE YOU&rdquo;) in the presence of Him whom he believed, even God, who gives life to the dead and calls into being that which does not exist.	45
NASB	Romans	4	18	In hope against hope he believed, so that he might become a father of many nations according to that which had been spoken, &ldquo;SO SHALL YOUR DESCENDANTS BE.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	4	19	Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah&rsquo;s womb;	45
NASB	Romans	4	2	For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.	45
NASB	Romans	4	20	Yet, with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in unbelief but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God,	45
NASB	Romans	4	21	And being fully assured that what God had promised, He was able also to perform.	45
NASB	Romans	4	22	Therefore IT WAS ALSO CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.	45
NASB	Romans	4	23	Now not for his sake only was it written that it was credited to him,	45
NASB	Romans	4	24	But for our sake also, to whom it will be credited, as those who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,	45
NASB	Romans	4	25	He who was delivered over because of our transgressions, and was raised because of our justification.	45
NASB	Romans	4	3	For what does the Scripture say? &ldquo;ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	4	4	Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due.	45
NASB	Romans	4	5	But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness,	45
NASB	Romans	4	6	Just as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:	45
NASB	Romans	4	7	&ldquo;BLESSED ARE THOSE WHOSE LAWLESS DEEDS HAVE BEEN FORGIVEN, AND WHOSE SINS HAVE BEEN COVERED.	45
NASB	Romans	4	8	&ldquo;BLESSED IS THE MAN WHOSE SIN THE LORD WILL NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	4	9	Is this blessing then on the circumcised, or on the uncircumcised also? For we say, &ldquo;FAITH WAS CREDITED TO ABRAHAM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	5	1	Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,	45
NASB	Romans	5	10	For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.	45
NASB	Romans	5	11	And not only this, but we also exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.	45
NASB	Romans	5	12	Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned&mdash;	45
NASB	Romans	5	13	For until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law.	45
NASB	Romans	5	14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the offense of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come.	45
NASB	Romans	5	15	But the free gift is not like the transgression. For if by the transgression of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many.	45
NASB	Romans	5	16	The gift is not like that which came through the one who sinned; for on the one hand the judgment arose from one transgression resulting in condemnation, but on the other hand the free gift arose from many transgressions resulting in justification.	45
NASB	Romans	5	17	For if by the transgression of the one, death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.	45
NASB	Romans	5	18	So then as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men.	45
NASB	Romans	5	19	For as through the one man&rsquo;s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous.	45
NASB	Romans	5	2	Through whom also we have obtained our introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand; and we exult in hope of the glory of God.	45
NASB	Romans	5	20	The Law came in so that the transgression would increase; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,	45
NASB	Romans	5	21	So that, as sin reigned in death, even so grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.	45
NASB	Romans	5	3	And not only this, but we also exult in our tribulations, knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance;	45
NASB	Romans	5	4	And perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope;	45
NASB	Romans	5	5	And hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.	45
NASB	Romans	5	6	For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.	45
NASB	Romans	5	7	For one will hardly die for a righteous man; though perhaps for the good man someone would dare even to die.	45
NASB	Romans	5	8	But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.	45
NASB	Romans	5	9	Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him.	45
NASB	Romans	6	1	What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin so that grace may increase?	45
NASB	Romans	6	10	For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God.	45
NASB	Romans	6	11	Even so consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.	45
NASB	Romans	6	12	Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts,	45
NASB	Romans	6	13	And do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.	45
NASB	Romans	6	14	For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace.	45
NASB	Romans	6	15	What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? May it never be!	45
NASB	Romans	6	16	Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone as slaves for obedience, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin resulting in death, or of obedience resulting in righteousness?	45
NASB	Romans	6	17	But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were committed,	45
NASB	Romans	6	18	And having been freed from sin, you became slaves of righteousness.	45
NASB	Romans	6	19	I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness, resulting in further lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness, resulting in sanctification.	45
NASB	Romans	6	2	May it never be! How shall we who died to sin still live in it?	45
NASB	Romans	6	20	For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.	45
NASB	Romans	6	21	Therefore what benefit were you then deriving from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the outcome of those things is death.	45
NASB	Romans	6	22	But now having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you derive your benefit, resulting in sanctification, and the outcome, eternal life.	45
NASB	Romans	6	23	For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.	45
NASB	Romans	6	3	Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?	45
NASB	Romans	6	4	Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.	45
NASB	Romans	6	5	For if we have become united with Him in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection,	45
NASB	Romans	6	6	Knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, in order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin;	45
NASB	Romans	6	7	For he who has died is freed from sin.	45
NASB	Romans	6	8	Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,	45
NASB	Romans	6	9	Knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, is never to die again; death no longer is master over Him.	45
NASB	Romans	7	1	Or do you not know, brethren (for I am speaking to those who know the law), that the law has jurisdiction over a person as long as he lives?	45
NASB	Romans	7	10	And this commandment, which was to result in life, proved to result in death for me;	45
NASB	Romans	7	11	For sin, taking an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me.	45
NASB	Romans	7	12	So then, the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.	45
NASB	Romans	7	13	Therefore did that which is good become a cause of death for me? May it never be! Rather it was sin, in order that it might be shown to be sin by effecting my death through that which is good, so that through the commandment sin would become utterly sinful.	45
NASB	Romans	7	14	For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am of flesh, sold into bondage to sin.	45
NASB	Romans	7	15	For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate.	45
NASB	Romans	7	16	But if I do the very thing I do not want to do, I agree with the Law, confessing that the Law is good.	45
NASB	Romans	7	17	So now, no longer am I the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.	45
NASB	Romans	7	18	For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not.	45
NASB	Romans	7	19	For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want.	45
NASB	Romans	7	2	For the married woman is bound by law to her husband while he is living; but if her husband dies, she is released from the law concerning the husband.	45
NASB	Romans	7	20	But if I am doing the very thing I do not want, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.	45
NASB	Romans	7	21	I find then the principle that evil is present in me, the one who wants to do good.	45
NASB	Romans	7	22	For I joyfully concur with the law of God in the inner man,	45
NASB	Romans	7	23	But I see a different law in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin which is in my members.	45
NASB	Romans	7	24	Wretched man that I am! Who will set me free from the body of this death?	45
NASB	Romans	7	25	Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, on the one hand I myself with my mind am serving the law of God, but on the other, with my flesh the law of sin.	45
NASB	Romans	7	3	So then, if while her husband is living she is joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress though she is joined to another man.	45
NASB	Romans	7	4	Therefore, my brethren, you also were made to die to the Law through the body of Christ, so that you might be joined to another, to Him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God.	45
NASB	Romans	7	5	For while we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were aroused by the Law, were at work in the members of our body to bear fruit for death.	45
NASB	Romans	7	6	But now we have been released from the Law, having died to that by which we were bound, so that we serve in newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter.	45
NASB	Romans	7	7	What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? May it never be! On the contrary, I would not have come to know sin except through the Law; for I would not have known about coveting if the Law had not said, &ldquo;YOU SHALL NOT COVET.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	7	8	But sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, produced in me coveting of every kind; for apart from the Law sin is dead.	45
NASB	Romans	7	9	I was once alive apart from the Law; but when the commandment came, sin became alive and I died;	45
NASB	Romans	8	1	Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.	45
NASB	Romans	8	10	If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness.	45
NASB	Romans	8	11	But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.	45
NASB	Romans	8	12	So then, brethren, we are under obligation, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh&mdash;	45
NASB	Romans	8	13	For if you are living according to the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live.	45
NASB	Romans	8	14	For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.	45
NASB	Romans	8	15	For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, &ldquo;Abba! Father!&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	8	16	The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God,	45
NASB	Romans	8	17	And if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him.	45
NASB	Romans	8	18	For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us.	45
NASB	Romans	8	19	For the anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of God.	45
NASB	Romans	8	2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death.	45
NASB	Romans	8	20	For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope	45
NASB	Romans	8	21	That the creation itself also will be set free from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.	45
NASB	Romans	8	22	For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the pains of childbirth together until now.	45
NASB	Romans	8	23	And not only this, but also we ourselves, having the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our body.	45
NASB	Romans	8	24	For in hope we have been saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for who hopes for what he already sees?	45
NASB	Romans	8	25	But if we hope for what we do not see, with perseverance we wait eagerly for it.	45
NASB	Romans	8	26	In the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words;	45
NASB	Romans	8	27	And He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.	45
NASB	Romans	8	28	And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.	45
NASB	Romans	8	29	For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren;	45
NASB	Romans	8	3	For what the Law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, God did: sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh,	45
NASB	Romans	8	30	And these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified.	45
NASB	Romans	8	31	What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?	45
NASB	Romans	8	32	He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?	45
NASB	Romans	8	33	Who will bring a charge against God&rsquo;s elect? God is the one who justifies;	45
NASB	Romans	8	34	Who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is He who died, yes, rather who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.	45
NASB	Romans	8	35	Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?	45
NASB	Romans	8	36	Just as it is written, &ldquo;FOR YOUR SAKE WE ARE BEING PUT TO DEATH ALL DAY LONG; WE WERE CONSIDERED AS SHEEP TO BE SLAUGHTERED.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	8	37	But in all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us.	45
NASB	Romans	8	38	For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,	45
NASB	Romans	8	39	Nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.	45
NASB	Romans	8	4	So that the requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.	45
NASB	Romans	8	5	For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.	45
NASB	Romans	8	6	For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace,	45
NASB	Romans	8	7	Because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able to do so,	45
NASB	Romans	8	8	And those who are in the flesh cannot please God.	45
NASB	Romans	8	9	However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him.	45
NASB	Romans	9	1	I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience testifies with me in the Holy Spirit,	45
NASB	Romans	9	10	And not only this, but there was Rebekah also, when she had conceived twins by one man, our father Isaac;	45
NASB	Romans	9	11	For though the twins were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad, so that God&rsquo;s purpose according to His choice would stand, not because of works but because of Him who calls,	45
NASB	Romans	9	12	It was said to her, &ldquo;THE OLDER WILL SERVE THE YOUNGER.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	9	13	Just as it is written, &ldquo;JACOB I LOVED, BUT ESAU I HATED.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	9	14	What shall we say then? There is no injustice with God, is there? May it never be!	45
NASB	Romans	9	15	For He says to Moses, &ldquo;I WILL HAVE MERCY ON WHOM I HAVE MERCY, AND I WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON WHOM I HAVE COMPASSION.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	9	16	So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy.	45
NASB	Romans	9	17	For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, &ldquo;FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE I RAISED YOU UP, TO DEMONSTRATE MY POWER IN YOU, AND THAT MY NAME MIGHT BE PROCLAIMED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EARTH.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	9	18	So then He has mercy on whom He desires, and He hardens whom He desires.	45
NASB	Romans	9	19	You will say to me then, &ldquo;Why does He still find fault? For who resists His will?&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	9	2	That I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart.	45
NASB	Romans	9	20	On the contrary, who are you, O man, who answers back to God? The thing molded will not say to the molder, &ldquo;Why did you make me like this,&rdquo; will it?	45
NASB	Romans	9	21	Or does not the potter have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for common use?	45
NASB	Romans	9	22	What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction?	45
NASB	Romans	9	23	And He did so to make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory,	45
NASB	Romans	9	24	Even us, whom He also called, not from among Jews only, but also from among Gentiles.	45
NASB	Romans	9	25	As He says also in Hosea, &ldquo;I WILL CALL THOSE WHO WERE NOT MY PEOPLE, &lsquo;MY PEOPLE,&rsquo; AND HER WHO WAS NOT BELOVED, &lsquo;BELOVED.&rsquo;&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	9	26	&ldquo;AND IT SHALL BE THAT IN THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS SAID TO THEM, &lsquo;YOU ARE NOT MY PEOPLE,&rsquo; THERE THEY SHALL BE CALLED SONS OF THE LIVING GOD.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	9	27	Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, &ldquo;THOUGH THE NUMBER OF THE SONS OF ISRAEL BE LIKE THE SAND OF THE SEA, IT IS THE REMNANT THAT WILL BE SAVED;	45
NASB	Romans	9	28	FOR THE LORD WILL EXECUTE HIS WORD ON THE EARTH, THOROUGHLY AND QUICKLY.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	9	29	And just as Isaiah foretold, &ldquo;UNLESS THE LORD OF SABAOTH HAD LEFT TO US A POSTERITY, WE WOULD HAVE BECOME LIKE SODOM, AND WOULD HAVE RESEMBLED GOMORRAH.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	9	3	For I could wish that I myself were accursed, separated from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh,	45
NASB	Romans	9	30	What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith;	45
NASB	Romans	9	31	But Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not arrive at that law.	45
NASB	Romans	9	32	Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as though it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone,	45
NASB	Romans	9	33	Just as it is written, &ldquo;BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	9	4	Who are Israelites, to whom belongs the adoption as sons, and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the temple service and the promises,	45
NASB	Romans	9	5	Whose are the fathers, and from whom is the Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.	45
NASB	Romans	9	6	But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For they are not all Israel who are descended from Israel;	45
NASB	Romans	9	7	Nor are they all children because they are Abraham&rsquo;s descendants, but: &ldquo;THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS WILL BE NAMED.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Romans	9	8	That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are regarded as descendants.	45
NASB	Romans	9	9	For this is the word of promise: &ldquo;AT THIS TIME I WILL COME, AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON.&rdquo;	45
NASB	Titus	1	1	Paul, a bond-servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of those chosen of God and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,	56
NASB	Titus	1	10	For there are many rebellious men, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,	56
NASB	Titus	1	11	Who must be silenced because they are upsetting whole families, teaching things they should not teach for the sake of sordid gain.	56
NASB	Titus	1	12	One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, &ldquo;Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.&rdquo;	56
NASB	Titus	1	13	This testimony is true. For this reason reprove them severely so that they may be sound in the faith,	56
NASB	Titus	1	14	Not paying attention to Jewish myths and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.	56
NASB	Titus	1	15	To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.	56
NASB	Titus	1	16	They profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny Him, being detestable and disobedient and worthless for any good deed.	56
NASB	Titus	1	2	In the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised long ages ago,	56
NASB	Titus	1	3	But at the proper time manifested, even His word, in the proclamation with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior,	56
NASB	Titus	1	4	To Titus, my true child in a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.	56
NASB	Titus	1	5	For this reason I left you in Crete, that you would set in order what remains and appoint elders in every city as I directed you,	56
NASB	Titus	1	6	Namely, if any man is above reproach, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, not accused of dissipation or rebellion.	56
NASB	Titus	1	7	For the overseer must be above reproach as God&rsquo;s steward, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not pugnacious, not fond of sordid gain,	56
NASB	Titus	1	8	But hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, just, devout, self-controlled,	56
NASB	Titus	1	9	Holding fast the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching, so that he will be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict.	56
NASB	Titus	2	1	But as for you, speak the things which are fitting for sound doctrine.	56
NASB	Titus	2	10	Not pilfering, but showing all good faith so that they will adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in every respect.	56
NASB	Titus	2	11	For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,	56
NASB	Titus	2	12	Instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in the present age,	56
NASB	Titus	2	13	Looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus,	56
NASB	Titus	2	14	Who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed, and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds.	56
NASB	Titus	2	15	These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one disregard you.	56
NASB	Titus	2	2	Older men are to be temperate, dignified, sensible, sound in faith, in love, in perseverance.	56
NASB	Titus	2	3	Older women likewise are to be reverent in their behavior, not malicious gossips nor enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good,	56
NASB	Titus	2	4	So that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,	56
NASB	Titus	2	5	To be sensible, pure, workers at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be dishonored.	56
NASB	Titus	2	6	Likewise urge the young men to be sensible;	56
NASB	Titus	2	7	In all things show yourself to be an example of good deeds, with purity in doctrine, dignified,	56
NASB	Titus	2	8	Sound in speech which is beyond reproach, so that the opponent will be put to shame, having nothing bad to say about us.	56
NASB	Titus	2	9	Urge bondslaves to be subject to their own masters in everything, to be well-pleasing, not argumentative,	56
NASB	Titus	3	1	Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good deed,	56
NASB	Titus	3	10	Reject a factious man after a first and second warning,	56
NASB	Titus	3	11	Knowing that such a man is perverted and is sinning, being self-condemned.	56
NASB	Titus	3	12	When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.	56
NASB	Titus	3	13	Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way so that nothing is lacking for them.	56
NASB	Titus	3	14	Our people must also learn to engage in good deeds to meet pressing needs, so that they will not be unfruitful.	56
NASB	Titus	3	15	All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.	56
NASB	Titus	3	2	To malign no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing every consideration for all men.	56
NASB	Titus	3	3	For we also once were foolish ourselves, disobedient, deceived, enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, spending our life in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.	56
NASB	Titus	3	4	But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared,	56
NASB	Titus	3	5	He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,	56
NASB	Titus	3	6	Whom He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,	56
NASB	Titus	3	7	So that being justified by His grace we would be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.	56
NASB	Titus	3	8	This is a trustworthy statement; and concerning these things I want you to speak confidently, so that those who have believed God will be careful to engage in good deeds. These things are good and profitable for men.	56
NASB	Titus	3	9	But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and strife and disputes about the Law, for they are unprofitable and worthless.	56
